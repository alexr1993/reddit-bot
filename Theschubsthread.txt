        |Can anyone explain to me why France's agricultural system is causing so many suicides? 


            |Son of a french farmer here. Farmers in France often live alone, with no company or friends (or maybe two or three 
            |ther farmers), most of the time they don't have a wife, so when kids grow up they're alone. And they don't get a lo
            | of money for the shitload of work they do.


                |hmm, kids and no wife? is there a high separation rate with french farmers?


                    |typically the wife is the first to be eaten in times of famine


                        |Why wouldn't you eat the kids first? That's like killing the goose that lays golden eggs. You eat the e
                        |gs, not the goose.


                            |Well, if they are small children then I imagine that it is because the kids have less meat. But the
                            | again, that meat will be juicy and tender.


                                |You seem to be talking from experience


                                    |It's the cheaper alternative to veal in many places.  


                                        |And kids are way cheaper to house than veal calves!


                            |How do you eat gold? 


                        |If you were eating the average american women, there would be meat for the whole summer. Too bad French
                        |women tend to be so much more shapely-barely enough for a good soup stock.


                        |That is a very strange comment to receive gold... Even with context.


                    |There have been more children born out of wedlock than there have been from married parents for some time (
                    |ince 2006 [according to the INSEE](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=NATnon0223
                    |)).////This statistic can be misleading though: parents may choose to marry later in life, just as they can
                    |separate (as you noted).

                    |It's possible, not all farms are mega-farms. My dad operated his farm by himself and still had time to do o

                        |Dude a couple hundred acres is enormous, that's an entire square kilometer.


                            |That's really small by farming standards.////$9 per bushel, 40 bushels per acre, 200 acres= $72000 
                            |or wheat //$12.88 per bushel, 40 bushels per acre, 200 acres= $103040 for soybeans.////That's gross

                                |Can confirm. Grew up on an Indiana farm. Had about 5000 acres when I graduated highschool.


                                |We have rice and bean farms out in east Arkansas that are around 10k-20k acres. I was working o
                                |t there about this time last year and one farmer I talked to said he, his dad and his brother o

                            |Yea he definitely worked a lot on the farm don't get me wrong it was not easy but it was doable. I

                            |and they got out. The majority of the time spent was fixing stuff like fences, the tractors, and ge

                            | sometimes, but rarely, or a quasi-professional friend that he would pay to come look at it if they
                            |couldn't fix it but other than that he was all on his own 98% of the time.

                                |oney, and produce from the front of their house. Seems like a lot of farmers can do multiple th

                            |Hello Indiana friends. Hows the farming this year?


                    |Farms in Europe are usually way smaller than the farms in the US.


                        |We have small farms here to, they're usually between 15 and 30 heads, I would still consider that to be
                        |too much work for one person. What are the scales like in Europe?


                            |Usually it just has a house on it. And the family runs the farm. I don't live on a farm, but I know
                            |some people who do. ////Sometimes they have outside help of one person. I live in the Netherlands t
                            | be a tad more specific, the situation might be different in France. But the farms seem to be about
                            |the same as they are over here.


                                |Sorry I meant heads of Cattle, not number of people working there. 


                                    |Oh haha. //I thought you meant people. I was already like, damn that's insane. But I knew t

                            |Here in Germany the average farm size in 2011 was 56 hectares (138 acres) and is rising quickly (20
                            |0: 52 hectares/128 acres) as small farms die off/are bought out.////This average is heavily skewed 
                            |y the megafarms in northern Germany - 55% of the total farmlands were held by farms larger than 100
                            |hectares (247 acres).////Whereas in northern Germany "first son takes all" was the common mode of i
                            |heritance (which lead to very big estates that then were turned into even larger conglomerates, the

                            |rmers (not sure how to translate this properly - these people are not hobby farmers, they do a lot 
                            |f farm work but need a second source of income to survive). The average Bavarian full-time farm is 
                            |un by 1.69 persons (of which 1.5 are family) and earns a wildly oscillating income depending on the
                            |prices for agricultural produce: average farm income was 35k € in 2009/10 but 47k € in 2010/11 (tha
                            |'s 31k €/year / $42k/year for each family member working on the farm). 


                    |It is 100 hrs of work a week during planting and harvesting seasons. Outside of those couple of months, it 
                    |s not nearly as work intensive. It is not uncommon to have a farmer with a full time job that takes a few w
                    |eks off in spring and fall to get the crops in/out. 


                        |I could see that being true for crops but my experience was on a dairy farm. People think that pigs are
                        |gross animals but having seen them side by side there is no question that the cow is the least hygienic

        |Learned a little bit about this topic in college a couple years ago, only it was about farmers committing suicide in In
        |ia where the problem seems to be much bigger. Long story short, there definitely subsidy problems, as well as GMO probl
        |ms that lead to farmers being poverty trap. These GMO's are marketed as "magic seeds" that will dramatically increase c
        |op yields. Farmers often take out loans for these seeds, so anything less than a great yield leaves them in debt. The p
        |oblem is, these seeds are patented, so getting these seeds from anyone besides the company who sells them, is a crime. 
        |h, and most are single-season seeds. They are genetically modified to reproduce sterile seeds, so the farmer must buy n
        |w seeds every season. ////[Vendana Shiva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandana_Shiva) has devoted her life to this topi

            |Ah, I was waiting for someone to link this to GMO.


            |Thanks for being aware!////I think the problem in france is mostly due to erosion. There are GMO problems as well, 
            |ut the EU bans on most GMO is pushed by popular opinion and the farmers have not been victimized in the same way as
            |India. //However, soil erosion is rampant and yields have climaxed in France. With the loss of arable land, nutrien
            | and water, farmers are forced to spend more on infrastructure and soil maintenance to try and meet the yields they
            |once knew and industry demands. Organic agriculture is picking up and rooting into the demographic, but not at the

        |Why are costs rising and profits falling?


            |You need to invest more and more into new technology, they are forced to do so by new laws and tight control on the
            |r products, and the return got cut each year due to more food industrialization and international commerce. Also th
            |y are very dependent to government help, without it i'm pretty sure they are not valid commercially, but it is a st
            |ategical option any government with a little sense will follow, so french government support them as much as they c
            |n financially, which is probably a lot from the government point of view, but not enough from the farmer, so confli
            |t are constant. They are pretty much engaged in a very fast spinning vicious circle, faster that they can handle. A
            |lot of the sector are more or less in a dead end which survival depend on governmental help. This is probably the c
            |use of that much suicide, also they are not very well respected in the society, contrary to american farmer, french
            |farmer is very low in the social ranks, so they are alone and have hard time finding wife and such, a farmer is alm
            |st an insult. They are not rich either they do have a lot of asset, but miss liquidity, and they sink in dept. My f

                |re for corn - a water intensive crop. So there's tons of land fallow, some have insurance but after a few years
                |of drought it has gotten real expensive. Then because the land is dry feed costs skyrocketed,  so all the ranch
                |rs sold their heifers early. So when I drive between towns, I don't see cattle and fields, it's just dirt and c

        |Or just get mad at Monsanto.


        |I agree I seem to recall a farmer's strike in France due to ridiculous oil prices so it wouldn't surprise me that they 
        |ould have a high suicide rate, but the key is how much higher than baseline.


        |u read  that Wired Magazine article about Chinese factory workers.  It was even more frustrating than this.


    |Just for those wondering, Greenland has the highest suicide rate by 100,000 people in the world. It's suicide rate for the 
    |hole country is almost three times the French farmer rate.


        |If you are going by populations I think it will be Canadian Inuits in the interior. From what I recall the suicide rate
        | in some villages were something like 1 in 20. 


            |Not according to Statistics Canada. [Ref](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/promotion/mental/index-eng.php)////At 
            |east not if you look at First Nations people in general.////Suicide rates for First Nations males is 126 per 100k, 
            |ompared to 133 for Greenland males. Both are still incredibly and sadly high.


                |Yeah I tried googling for the documentary I heard this in but I can't find it. It was talking about a specific 
                |own where gas sniffing was prevalent, along with suicide, something I watched on either BBC iplayer or Netflix.


                    |Aww yes gas sniffing. I too watched that report. It's all they do for entertainment it seems.


                |But in some region it's much higher, Labrador AFAIK.


                    |according to wikipedia and [this document you would be incorrect](http://www.suicideprevention.ca/about-sui
                    |ide/) ////NL and Labrador has consistently ranked among the very lowest overall suicide rates in Canada.///
                    |On the other hand, [page 16 (36 via pdf) of this document](http://www.ahf.ca/downloads/suicide.pdf) suggest
                    | that you're correct as late as 1983 anyway.////I think we should rely on the more recent result though.


                        |Well, I rely on stuff I saw on TV two decades ago, so my statistics are not so fresh and reliable :)


            |Wow. That is so sad. I wonder if Alaskan Inuits have a similar number.


                |IIRC Inuits everywhere have shockingly high suicide rates. There's a debate over what causes it. Some people th
                |nk the Inuit suicide rate is in some way due to contact with the settlers, and others think it's just a reality
                |of living in an arctic climate and the suicide rates among them have always been that high. I'd be curious to k
                |ow if similar tendencies manifested themselves among Russia's Koryaks, Sakha, and other Siberian natives who li
                |e in similar climates.


                    |In a historical context, Inuits and desert nomads probably have the roughest lives of freemen. I would lean
                    |toward their suicide rates being largely unaffected by outsiders.


                        |One thing I could think of, though it might be entirely irrelevant, is that traditionally an old Inuit 
                        |ould ask to be killed when they couldn't help or felt they were more of a burden. Since in the modern d
                        |y this might cause the person they ask to kill them to get in serious trouble, they might decide to off
                        |themselves instead.


                            |Nope, mostly young men killing themselves in Inuit communities :(


                            |So a switch from assisted suicide to self executed suicide, I could see that. 


                            |It might have to do with the 6 months of no sunlight and lack of Vitamin D supplements.


                |Just to clarify, the singular is "Inuk", the plural is "Inuit". No "s" needed.


        |It seems that it's attributed to crime, harassment and such, not weather.  Being in Greenland, you can be a big of a di
        |k to your fellow man with much repercussions due to the isolation.  


        |"Rate" should be qualified with time, also per population would be more useful.


            |Typically suicide rates are qualified as suicides per 100,000 people per year. 


        |I guess the whole "Greenland" thing didn't really work out.


    |Suicidologist here.////I just wanted to point out that this isn't entirely that odd.  Suicide consistently ranks in the top
    |5 causes of death until very old age, no matter what the demographic.  It is higher in male-dominated fields (like farming)
    |because suicide is higher in males (about 4x higher, except in China).  This may be an important thing to know, but suicide
    |is a major cause of death and requires significant investigation.////In my country, (Canada), suicide kills more youth (10-
    |4) than almost EVERY disease combined.  There are more suicides in this age than there are DIAGNOSES of cancer, and yet sui
    |ide research, prevention, and intervention remains tragically low compared to other areas of research.  If you are concerne
    | about people and their wellbeing, you should be concerned about suicide.  We need to create an entire community of support
    |around it.


        |People constantly cite method as the primary reason for the suicide gender gap, but this is an obvious cop out in my op
        |nion. Female self-harming is probably getting recorded as suicide attempts and failed male suicide attempts are probabl
        | under reported. Choice of method is indicative of a person's desire to die. Do you think my speculations have any vali
        |ity?


        |Wait that's actually a profession? There are people who study suicidal statistics (and I'm assuming patterns) for a LIV
        |NG?!////My hate off to you sir (or madam). That job would make me so depressed.


            |I am a psychiatrist specializes in emergency child-and-adolescent psychiatry, and my area of specialty is suicide r
            |sk.  It is stressful but not depressing, I approach each day with vigour and work to save lives!  The more we know 
            |bout suicide and suicide risk, the more we can target prevention and intervention.  If we knew everything and "coul
            |n't stop it," I would get depressed.  But we're entering an exciting time of research - we are identifying genes, p
            |tterns, and experiencing significant decreases in youth suicidal thinking over the past 10 years.////Thank you for 
            |he comment... but like most who became doctors, I wanted to work to save lives.  Why not go for the thing that caus
            |s more death in youth than all cancers, lung diseases, and infections combined?


                |Maybe it would be more worthwhile to eradicate depression, rather than trying to stop people who deem their lif
                | not worth living from releasing themselves.

    |Is this like suicide rates with farmers in the UK (which i recall is also quite high) where it's cause could be a mix of a 
    |ough industry to live on and easy access to guns, which is the theory as to why there is a high suicide rate


        |I kinda doubt it is really predicated on the easy access to guns bit, though farmers in the UK have a bit easier access
        |than others.////Mainly because despite huge variance in number of guns available, and laws regarding them, between the 
        |K, Canada and the USA, all three countries have pretty much the same suicide rate overall. about 11.5-12 per 100,000.//
        |/I mean, it might have a bit to do with UK farmers specifically, but i would be betting far more on it being the tough,

            |Just a quick correction. The EU controls minimum prices and subsidies, so they can't directly make farms unprofitab

    |A railroad worker commits suicide every 1.5 days in Albania. Why isn't anyone talking about that?


        |Because this came from a French news site.


        |I just talked about it with a buddy of mine the other day. No, I think it was last week. Yeah, it was definitely last w

    |That farmer's family must be getting tired of his shit. 


    |So is this farmer really bad at committing suicide? I feel like he should have had the hang of it by now.
