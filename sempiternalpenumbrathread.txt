About reading, and not reading.(/r/books)




    |Just when you think you're out...they *puuuulll* you back in...


        |Silvio or the original ? 


            |I was happy about the original reference AND happy about the Sopranos reference. (Van Zant's awesome)


        |Things everyone needs to experience in life:////Books and Seinfeld


            |But it's a Godfather reference. 


                |Which was referenced in Seinfeld...a show that had references to a ton of other things since it was a show abou
                | pretty much ordinary people doing ordinary things and social etiquette. ////No matter what is said, I'm gonna 
                |tand by my message.


                    |Which is why every situation ever reminds me of a Seinfeld quote.


                    |&gt;it was a show about pretty much ordinary people doing ordinary things and social etiquette////I always 
                    |hought it was a show about nothing.

    |The more you read, the more you realize how little you know- one of life's wonderful ironies.


        |The more you know the less you understand. — supposedly by Tao te Ching (couldn't get direct confirmation on source) fr

        |I think this goes for learning in general.  And is probably the reason for the Dunning-Kruger effect.


    |No matter what drags you away from reading, there is always something that takes you back to the mystical world of words!


        |read this in Martin Prince's voice and it becomes hilarious


    |We're happy for you :)


    |Congratulations!  And I love you, too.  


        |Maybe.


    |if you love to read you can live 1000 lives. If you don't read, you can only live one. //I know the quote is not verbatim a
    |d I don't know who said it, but it is so true. 


        |“A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one.” //― George R.R. M
        |rtin, A Dance With Dragons. 


            |One of my all time favorite quotes.


            |Not to be that guy, but I'm pretty pretty sure GRRM stole this from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. He wrote alm
            |st the exact same quote in *Meditations*, just about 2,000 years earlier. Still a great book and quote, though.//


            |Don't you realise that that's a spoiler? ''he dies, said JOJEN.''.


                |wow you're a scumbag


        |While we all love reading in this subreddit, I think it's important that we don't consider ourselves better than other 
        |eople just because of our hobby. One of my friends is an amazing glassblower, puts his heart and soul into his hobby, I
        |d consider each creation of his as valuable to his soul as every book I've "lived".////I just hate the GRR martin quote
        |because it reads very "we're better than those filthy non-readers", when we simply enjoy a different creative outlet.


            |I agree. I've been thinking about that quote lately, and I feel that while reading can allow you to "live 1000 live
            |", so can movies, story-driven video games, and comics. 


                |Those don't exist in asoiaf!


                    |Good point. The context is very important in that quote.


                    |Epic songs do.


                |Was just about to say the same thing. However, I do feel that books allow for a deeper, perhaps more polemical 
                |xploration of theme and character.


            |I don't think I am better than anyone else because I read, but I do believe I am a better me because I read, and al
            | people would be a better them if they read. 


        |Quote is true , but the use of the word verbatim confused me  , i kept thinking , how can the quote be a DVD manufactur
        |r? ////Then it struck me , you meant the other kind of verbatim...////I feel dumb now


    |I'm jealous of you all. I'm in a full-time, very intensive nursing program and I haven't been able to read anything for lei
    |ure in six months. I used to go through several books a month. Lurking on this sub helps a little.


        |We might be the same person. Very intense nursing program and I'm right there with you. Had a three week break from sum
        |er to fall semester and I tore through the first three books of ASoIaF and now I'm yearning to continue. I miss losing 
        |yself in a good book, feels like part of me is missing. 


        |Do you commute at all? I recently was able to get back into books through audio books while driving. I know it's not "r
        |ading" but i still get to grow with characters and experience a great story.  


            |Years later I find it hard to remember whether I read it or listened to it. The experience is much the same. 


        |Know how you feel.  I read regularly but in the last while work has hit me like a freight train.  Started reading The S
        |and and got to book two.  Can't wait to go back to it.  Some people say read a page or two here and there but I can't d
        | that.  I have this weird thing were I can only read a book chapter by chapter, not page by page!  I need the time to s
        |t down, relax without much on my mind and get engrossed in it.  Otherwise it's not the same.


            |Jeanette Winterson has written about how people have stopped making time for reading and instead only read in the i
            |-between (waiting for appointments, right before bed, etc.). She considers it a tragedy.


        |You'll get back into when you're ready. I got through my Ph.D qualifying exams earlier last year and had literally not 
        |ead a book for two years. Now that things have gotten more normal, I've been reading like crazy. So many many books hav
        | come out!


        |What about just a page or two here and there ? In the time it takes to lurk... :)


    |I second this! I recently got back into reading, but joining r/books has kept me far more motivated to continue than I woul
    | be on my own.


    |Right now I relate to 25 year old you. I got a bit choked up reading this, so I guess that means it's time to subscribe to 
    |his thread and start reading again.


    |Wow... you're me... only, I JUST started to rediscover books a few months ago. When I was in high school, I finished a book
    |every 2-3 days. Message boards, the internet, and uni pulled me away from books until I picked up an amazing book on a frie
    |d's recommendation. I had been wanting to get back into reading once uni finished, but was really, really intimidated by by
    |this notion that I should read "quality" fiction. Came to realize I didn't have to suffer through "classics" to be a reader
    |-- not saying that classics are dull or insufferable; I just happen to always pick ones that I can't get into. Now, I've st
    |rted to accept that I can read what I want. 


    |I'm where you are...girlfriend, school, and the internet pulled me away for almost 2 years. But books are back and your suc
    |inct way of putting it made me feel understood. so, thanks for that!////“That moment when you finish a book, look around, a
    |d realize that everyone is just carrying on with their lives as though you didn't just experience emotional trauma at the h
    |nds of a paperback.”


        |Yes, the feeling described in the quote is exactly something I forgot about and I rarely ever felt it after watching a 
        |ilm. And thanks for the word succinct; never heard of it, amazing.////


    |To offer a different perspective. I never read books for entertainment until a few years ago and even then I haven't read t
    |at much. But over the past few months I've read four books which is a huge achievement for me. ////I watch a lot tv series/
    |ovies and movies to escape from the outside world.////I do love what you said about "I re-discovered reading and its solitu
    |e that doesn't feel lonely". It's exactly what I feel when I experience that sensation of being completely absorbed in a ne
    | book.


    |You bring up an issue I'm sure many of us struggle with. I find myself in a similar situation - being in college, I have to
    |make a conscious effort to set aside some time to read, which doesn't occur nearly as much as I would like. Schoolwork, ass
    |gned texts, friends, drinking on the weekends, and a SO often suck up all the free time I'm able to wring out; and it doesn
    |t help that Reddit exists either! ////But I feel like having to budget my personal reading makes me appreciate it all the m
    |re.The hour I get to read the paper/do the crossword, actually finishing my work early so I can snatch a half hour with my 
    |atest novel before bed, even the 10 minutes I get in class before my professor gets in - all of these are treasured moments
    |where I can relax and escape the stressful life of a senior in college.


    |I'm happy that books have come back into your life! I went through a similar time in my life where I barely read any books 
    |or quite a few years out side of school reading (late high school, early college). Towards the end of college, on a whim, I
    |decided that I should start reading for fun again, remembering how much I enjoyed it when my life was less hectic. When I w
    |s younger, I was known in my family for always being in a book. So I picked a genre I liked (science fiction) and went to a
    |used bookstore with a list of Hugo award winning scifi books, and rekindled my love of books. But I also have to say my boo
    | reading REALLY accelerated when I discovered what a great community we have here in r/books! I'm always discovering new bo
    |ks and authors and ideas, and now my list of books to read is a mile long and every time I finish a book or series, it's a 
    |truggle to pick what to read next!


    |/lit is way better


    |Don't forget to sign up / check out book recommendation services like Goodreads. You'll be reading so many books you love, 
    |ou'll never leave again!


        |Yeah, I did that.. now I have an ever-growing to-read list!


    |Wow are you me? Because I'm in the same situation ! And now with Internet, it is a lot easier to find good books. I won't b
    | able to put my kindle down for a long time !


    |I admit as well, this subreddit extended my "to be read" list quite a lot. Thanks guys for recommending all the awesome boo
    |s! 


    |Last 5 books?


        |The Time Traveller's Wife, One Hundred Years of Solitude, New York Trilogy, Silk, Passion 


    |I'm glad you found it again!////I keep buying books even if I don't have a lot of time to read. I wish I had more time, alt
    |ough I could *take* the time.


    |I quit reading after college, traumatized (haha) by enforced reading of things I didn't care about. I'm glad I picked it ba
    |k up again a few years later. The more frantic and upsetting the internet becomes, the better it feels to get my headspace 
    |nto the vacuum that is an old book.


    |Congrats, book-brother. I recently got back into reading too. ////My mother bought me a nook the other month, and a friend 
    |irected me to a a website with a ton of ebooks that have gone public domain. 


    |Well, I'm happy for you and hope to find myself in the same situation soon. I'd probably have to get off reddit at some poi
    |t...


    |This moved me far more than I expected it to. I think I need to pick up a book now. 


        |aww


    |I came here to correct your spelling of learned. Instead, I went to the dictionary and learnt that learnt is indeed a word.
    |Cheers!


        |Well I wouldn't be surprised if I was wrong, having English as my second language.


    |Reading, for me, is one of the best ways to spend my time. Even a bad book teaches me new things =] 


    |I'm the same way; I used to read a lot and now I hardly read at all. I think I'm gonna get a Kindle Paperwhite, since I thi
    |k that will make it easier for me.


    |I stopped reading books for a decade, at least, until I found one on Reddit written by a Redditor. I don't know what it was
    | but it triggered a furious thirst for books again. I read about 5  350+ paged books in about 4 days each. I couldn't get e
    |ough. Sadly though, my thirst has been quenched, for now. 


    |I'm 21, I think that in my whole life  I might have read 30 books tops. And that's counting textbooks *and* novels. Frankly
    |I don't really see the appeal of books. This summer I've got really bored and I bought three novels (House of Leaves, Fight
    |Club and Lullaby); did I enjoy them? sure. Did reading them made me want start reading routinely? Not at all, in fact, thos
    | are the last books I've read.////What to make of that? I don't know, I just think that books aren't the most efficient for
    | of entertainment. For comparison, in the last 4 years I've seen north of 900 movies.


    |What was the book that reignited your passion? Or post? 


        |I postponed the actual reading because I felt kind of lost where to begin again. Someone mentioned Goodreads, it made m
        | curious and when I signed up, filled out what I read and got a recommendation of Passion by J. Winterson which I absol
        |tely adored, that was it, I guess.


    |You must be female


    |What I've been doing for a while now is going to local coffee shops and reading. I find that taking myself out of my home h
    |lps me to escape into the book more, while simultaneously removing me from my other hobbies and letting me enjoy delicious 
    |offee beverages.

        |Speaking of which, no one gives two shits that you don't give two shits. Your post, calling OP's post pointless, is, in
        |fact, pointless itself.
