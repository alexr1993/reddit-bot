        |Another bit of advice I'd give is, if you need to use the bathroom, don't look into the mirror. I think I spent about 15 minutes, p
        |obably more, staring into it. It's just so easy to get lost.////Before I tripped, I spent the entire afternoon acid-proofing my apa
        |tment. I put all sharp, or possibly dangerous, objects in a safe place, made sure any cords weren't in a place that could be trippe
        | on, etc. Maybe not completely necessary, but I felt much better knowing my apartment was free of any complications that might have
        |arisen.////Other than that, get your comfiest blankets and pillows out and, if at all possible, have a nature documentary to watch 
        |t some point. Watching two giraffes fighting each other, in David Attenborough's *Africa* series, while the acid first hit, was one
