Smooth with the ladies(/r/gifs)




    |Source? I really want to hear that faceplant. 


        |Oh god, the sound is beautiful, the dialogue makes it even better.//http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_4xfGJQrTA


            |Obviously staged, but well done. It's a Vine, so he obviously planned it to be this short.

                    |Are u ok

                        |No he is not. 


                        |Unreddit dosen't work, what was the comment? 


                    |He didn't post it on Facebook. It's posted by an account called **Best Vines**. Guess where they get their 
                    |ideos?


                        |From their close friends facebook?

                        |He's a troll. How do you people *always* fall for this shit?


                        |He's a troll. How do you people *always* fall for this shit?


                    |I bet you laughed though, scumbag human. 


            |AHHHHHHHHH////Thank you. Perfect timing. I want to smack anyone that says "people are always asking me ..." What th
            |y mean is they're always wishing someone would ask them ... ////What's it like to be a sexy idiot?


                |&gt; What's it like to be a sexy idiot?////I'm glad you asked, Frank.

                        |-2850 comment karma... He feeds on downvotes, guys.


            |It's well-acted, but the sound is him slapping the table with his hand. Frame-forward at 5 seconds to see it; his h
            |ad gets within a few inches of the table but never strikes it. The padded bar is a warning that the table is near a
            |d he should pull back.


            |It looks as if he did it on purpose. His head goes down as if he's intentionally headbutting that bar. And it's sus
            |iciously padded with a thick towel.


    |Is that darius rucker?


        |Taye Diggs. 


            |Just checked, it is him. Thank you!


                |Maybe if the image was a little bigger and less pixelated, we'd be able to tell properly!


                |Maybe white people can't tell black people apart, regardless!


        |I listen to country music on a regular basis. TIL: Darius Rucker is black.


            |I also learned today that Hootie is black. 


                |You're kidding? 


                    |I am not the biggest of Hootie and the Blowfish fans. 


                        |Makes sense. They helped me through a lot of breakups in high school. But that was over ten years ago. 


                |I just learnt that Eminem is black.


            |Also the former lead singer of Hootie and the blow fish


            |The name wasn't a big enough hint??


            |Old Crow Medicine Show, on the other hand is mostly white, with a token asian guy.  


        |Quite possibly. In the original video, his voice sounds almost identical to Darius Rucker when he's being interviewed. 
        |an't confirm this though.


        |Was thinking [August Marks] (http://sonsofanarchy.wikia.com/wiki/August_Marks) from Sons of Anarchy. Definitely Taye Di
        |gs though. 


    |Taye Diggs fails hard, but he scored a hot wife!  


        |what?////she looks like man with that giant nordic jaw


            |She doesn't look like a man. She's a beautiful women, but you're right about that jaw...


    |Who cares if it's fake?! It's still funny and makes me chuckle every time I watch it. Wtf compels people to write 'dis fake
    | in comments. I'll never understand. I can only think in reply 'and your point? so? duh?'


        |**FAKE!!!**


    |Was this recorded with a rock?


        |No it was a potato, that's the 2nd gen rock.


    |I think this is fake. Vines are only 6 seconds and he would not have had time to get his point across. 


        |It's not meant to be taken seriously. The dialogue is something to the effect of "People always ask me what it's like b
        |ing so attractive." It's just a comedic Vine.


        |You people take things too seriously.


            |http://reactiongifs.com/?p=14623


        |Its definitely fake, just look at how his heads swings down and hits it for no reason.


    |Don't care if it was staged this is fucking hilarious.


    |That,kids, is another reason to keep your feet off the furniture.


    |This still went better than most of my interactions with women. 


    |What do ladies have to do with this gif?


        |Fairly certain he is saying he is smooth with the ladies before he self-pwns


            |"People are constantly asking me, 'What's it like to be a sexy...'"  


                |Then proceeds to face plant.


    |Myth busted, black can in fact crack.


    |I'm a straight white guy who is primarily only attracted to white ladies....////but I'd give Taye Diggs a go. I don't feel 
    |ike anyone can resist that smile.////And also maybe Shemar Moore.////Maybe I'm gay for certain black dudes.


        |Straight guy here. Would fuck taye diggs. No homo. pause.


    |I'm suddenly reminded of Rocky I


    |Tried to find a clip of To Be Or Not To Be by Mel Brooks, where the SS officer tries to sit on the corner of the desk and s
    |ips off...I guess this text description will have to suffice.


    |Leon phelps ... The ladies man


    |totally /r/Unexpected 


    |Dat ragdoll animation... So sweet.


    |Is that Hootie? LOL


        |Taye Diggs.

    |Damn, that brotha is smoooth


    |you gotta make them laugh so he thought let's go with the face plant approach


    |No one puts they're foot up on a Panton S chair. Not even you, Taye Diggs.


    |drinking coffee, almost wearing coffee 


    |I like the Fornasetti plates the background


    |The more I watch, the funnier it gets.


    |I dont see ladies anywhere


    |Fake.//


    |Shit tyrone's dad...


        |It is genetic. 


        |LOL!!! Fucking laugh at that one for a long time! nice!


    |First time laughing all day, thank you op.


    |Every time this gets reposted the quality goes worse.////p.s. also its a nice gif!


    |This looks fake to me. The way he falls looks unnatural to me.


        |Its a vine, dog. 


    |Is this a gif for ants?


    |Lmao, Black Man Down!!


        |"Hey it's a black person!Quick, let's make a black people joke to get karma, reddit always luv it while you dump on the
        |colored humans.....hah hah hah. Me so clever."  - 13 year olds on Reddit.


            |Why did you just post that garbage?


    |oh shit hahaha


    |"Hay there lady's, let me tell you arrrr! fuck! fuck!"


    |Are all gifs just taken from vines now?


    |Shits fake.  Just happens to hit his head on the soft couch?  Unnatural body motion too. 


        |Wow such investigation. Are you like a detective or something? 


            |Also the video is a vine. Who would make a 6 second video explaining anything? It's staged my man. 


            |Its fake. Its supposed to be a joke cause he's so smooth with the ladies and hits his face.  He misses his step and
            |forgets how to use every other part of his body to prevent him from smashing his face?  Not a detective, this video
            |is supposed to be a joke.  Get over it dude, not everything on the Internet is real.


                |I know it's fake you moron. The point I was trying to make is that it's obviously fake, and we all know it's a 
                |oke. So we don't need everyone pointing out the obvious..


                    |Cool your jets mershinator. I'm sorry I pointed out the obvious. 


                |I'm pretty sure the video is real. It was made with a real camera and there's a real person in it. Pretty sure 
                |he effect of gravity in the video is real too, but that could be CGI.


                    |I'm sorry crash11b, I would love a friendly debate on whether or not this Taye Diggs video is real or not b
                    |t mershinator won't allow it. 


    |cant tell if fake or real


    |What is wrong with reddit? I saw this on Facebook 1 week ago. 


    |how does fake shit like this even get 30 uprons//


        |Go back under your bridge, troll.


            |You're an idiot if you can't tell this was staged.////EDIT: 12 idiots and counting.


                |Check the YouTube-Link /u/CensoredBlonde posted above...////Edit: destructive german autocorrect


                    |And? It's like a few seconds longer and just as fake.


    |/r/whitepeoplegifs ???


    |Face first MWAHAHAHAHAHA ಠ_ಠ


    |People calling fake need to watch the source video.////This dude ate shit and there's no way it was staged.
