ELI5: Why do we care so much about finding water on other planets, when other forms of life could have evolved to not need water?(/r/Explain Like I'm Five | Don't Panic!)




    |Life could exist out there that doesn't need water. However, most of the life we know of does. We're already looking for a 
    |eedle in a haystack, if we expand the search to life that doesn't need water then we don't even know what the needle looks 
    |ike anymore. ////Edit; apparently some stuff doesn't use water


        |This also gets philosophical, in a way. If we do happen to find a form of life that doesn't require water or isn't carb
        |n-based or any other commonality that lifeforms on Earth have, do we still consider it "life?" What constitutes the def
        |nition of something that's "living?"


            |There are seven different points of criteria to consider something living.  //1. It must display order.  //2. It mu
            |t harness and utilize energy.  //3. It must be able to respond to stimuli.  //4. It must exhibit homeostasis.  //5.
            |It must grow and develop.  //6. It must evolve.  //7. It must be able to reproduce.  ////Many cells may straddle th
            | line between the biotic and abiotic world. Viruses for example, while they do show many of the characteristics of 
            |ife, they still rely on the ability to infect cells. On their own they are not able to reproduce and they do not re
            |pond to stimuli, grow or metabolize energy. Therefore, even with DNA and RNA within the cell, they are still not co
            |sidered alive. 


                |I took a course on astrobiology, and one of the biggest issues with the search for extra-terrestrial life is wh
                |t exactly do we consider "life". These 7 criteria came up, as well as a few other approaches. One of the most i
                |teresting things related to these classifications was the difficulty in discounting fire from the lists. Fire r
                |produces, reacts to its environment, consumes fuel and gives off waste etc etc. One of the most intriguing idea
                | I took away from that course was the concept of us finding life in the universe which is closer to our idea of
                |fire rather than biological life. 


                    |Isn't fire just a chemical reaction? While life is.. oh god.


                    |More interesting to me would be if a hooloovoo would qualify.


                |By that logic mules are not living.  Am I mistaken?


                    |He worded that wrong. It's supposed to be "Must be the product of reproduction". Or something like that


                        |No, that's simply not true. /u/BalooBot was right. Things that are "alive" in the scientific sense must
                        |be able to reproduce. For example, this is why viruses are not considered alive; they can move around a
                        |d expel genetic material into hosts, but they cannot reproduce unaided. Obviously they do manage to rep
                        |oduce, but this is only by hijacking the protein synthesis systems of host organisms.


                            |So if a man is born sterile then he is not alive?


                                |I'm talking about species here, not individuals. If a species were sterile, it would not be ali
                                |e (since ya know, all the organisms would die out). One man's sterility does not mean he is not
                                |alive; his cells are still reproducing as usual.////Also, his genes would still be compatible w
                                |th other humans'; the mechanisms for dispelling them just wouldn't be working. Does this make a
                                |y sense?


                                    |Yea it makes sense. We just went over this in my biology class a couple weeks ago but I don
                                    |t have my notes and can't remember the wording exactly.////Maybe the fact that a virus must
                                    |go outside it's own to reproduce. Also, don't viruses not mix their DNA like typical living

                                |His cells at least are clearly reproducing all the time.


                                    |So the cells are life?


                        |Well please, correct me if I'm wrong, but by that logic wouldn't Dolly the Sheep (or any other genetic 
                        |lone) not be considered living?


                            |No. Cloning works through manipulation of the traditional mechanisms of reproduction, not circumven

                                |To put it another way, there are two types of reproduction: sexual and asexual. The later produ

                                |production in nature. Cloning is, in principle, artificial asexual reproduction, so fits with t

                                |Dolly the sheep was made via one adult somatic cell.  Not only were there not two partners (as 
                                |equired for mammalian reproduction), but there were no gametes.  That is definitely circumventi

                    |From a certain vantage, yes. It helps to back up a little.////If you think about all the animals in each of

                    |a surface, if that 'fire cell' has an internal structure different from the outside environment and it has 
                    | 'need' to seek out some other form of energy. ////This 'fire cell' would then be alive because it is stori

            |The 7 Characteristics of Life


            |There's actual scientific criteria for something to be considered "alive"


            |Split it up with things we already call life: trees are nothing like people, but both are alive. Still, both requir
            | water, warmth, and nourishment and both consume and grow until they can reproduce, cells splitting all along, unti
            | eventually, they don't. Death is also (so far) a requirement to living.


            |I thought we defined life as anything carbon-based, able to reproduce and transfer genetic material...or some shit 
            |ike that.


            |Made up of cells, senses and responds, reproduces- asexually or sexually, has DNA, uses energy, and grows and devel
            |ps/ adapts.////////C'mon man...  people learn this in like fourth grade... 


            |Something that is living must be able to reproduce, respond to its environment, amongst other things. Using water i
            | not a requirement. 


            |I think the definition is that it can reproduce. A human can. A cell can. Even microorganisms can. Therefor they ar
            | alive. ////It might not be DNA, might not even be RNA, but if it can reproduce or split in some way then it's life
            | ////Stone cant. Therefor it's not life. Stone can under some conditions produce more stone from other matter, but 
            |nly as part of exterior factors. Nothing enters stone matter, then more stone matter comes out. This is not life. W
            | have discovered new, unfamiliar lifeless matter through and been able to define quite conclusively that it is a li
            |eless matter. ////I find the definitions to be rather simple, even for unimaginable forms of life or other undiscov
            |red matter. //


            |We've already found life that isn't carbon based, on earth. Arsenic, in fact


                |If you're talking about that study that came out a couple years ago, that was found to be a faulty experiment.


            |There is a formal definition of what life is, independently of its composition or if it even ressembles anything we
            |ve seen before. Briefly, something alive is capable of self reproduction, so it "makes" more of itself. This is par
            | of the definition because this way you can't classify robots -which can "eat" (get energy from electric current) a
            |d interact with their environment- as alive beings. But the complete definition is longer and more complex, you can

            |If it has ray guns and comes to earth to steal our women.


            |Life is defined by a few traits; homeostasis, DNA, cells, interaction with environment, evolve, die, grow and maint

                |There are several organisms that have no DNA. I understand what you're getting at, but it could be more scienti

        |Life has been seen to evolve from the elements CHONSP. The miller urey experiment proceeded after finding this discover
        | which indicates that all the organic components needed for life follow with these basic elements. One of the main thes
        |s' of today is that first primitive vacuole membranes formed after a long time in this organic mush compound. From here
        |basic cells formed and started the chain of life and then the vacuoles evolved, became complex and then larger organism
        | came.//// Oh, and one of the biggest parts of this chain is that it happened within a medium, water precisely. You can
        |examine some of this happening along rivers and streams next to land where you can see the different stages of these ev
        |lving organisms that lead into plants using an older form of photosynthesis ect.


        |This is exactly what I've been thinking, though. There have been so many headlines about water on mars....and yet we do
        |'t even know if this is anything significant at all! It's like as if creatures from another planet found tiny traces of
        |a substance on Earth that we don't even know exists but is vital to THEIR form of life....and then they try use this as
        |evidence that life might exist on Earth...but we don't even need that substance for human life! 


            |I'm not an expert in life sciences, or anything, but something to consider is that not all substances in the Univer
            |e are equal in terms of their capability of producing life in a purely mechanical sense.  Consider that the buildin
            | blocks of Earth life: Nitrogen, Oxygen, Carbon, and Hydrogen are some of the simplest atoms in the periodic table.
            | You hear about the idea of Silicon based life a lot in lieu of Carbon, but on deeper inspection, Silicon can't do 
            |he kinds of things that Carbon does in the body-- making huge chains of complex organic chemicals.  Without the abi
            |ity to form complexity, you're taking a lot of the fuel out of the evolutionary process. ////Water in particular is
            |well suited to developing life because it's ubiquitous, likely produced in the early Universe, and because of its b
            |havior as a liquid and a solvent, makes an excellent environment in which random interactions might produce the spa
            |k of life.  There isn't another similarly well-distributed substance like water, except for clouds of hydrogen gas 
            |nd such.  It's the simplicity of it. ////Of course, your point is also valid, in that we only know one general form
            |of life, and other life doesn't need to be constructed the same way.  But it's not really true to think of it as a 
            |otal free for all, and that life could be built out of noble gasses and rare metals, for example, because you have 
            |o still form the machinery of life with available materials for it to spontaneously erupt.  ////APOLOGY: I forgot w
            |at ELI5 meant.  Pretend you're a really sharp 5 year old.


            |Water is an extremely unique substance that grants it special properties and makes it very useful in the process of
            |creating and sustaining life. While it is possible that other life forms can use other substances, it's not very li
            |ely.


            |Everywhere on Earth, where there is water there is life. To us, all evidence points to a STRONG correlation between
            |life and water. Probability of life is high, in our experience, when you have water.


            |The excitement over water on Mars is about much more than just the possibility of life.  If a place has water, then
            |if and when we go there we can do many things with it.  Grow plants, crack it for oxygen, make rocket fuel, etc.  W
            |ter is heavy and weight adds cost and complexity to missions.  If we can just harvest it when we arrive somewhere, 
            |hen that makes things so much easier. 


            |Listen, the answer to this is life as we know it needs water because it is a good environment for a range of chemic
            |l reactions to take place in a controllable manner. Thats about it.


        |Along with water and carbon have very interesting properties and are very helpful in chemical reactions and well life. 
        |o life could live without them, but as far as we know it would be harder and less likely.


        |WRONG (sorry for caps, just to get your attention). This is a good answer, but it's technically incorrect. We know of l
        |fe that does not require water. There are chemosynthetic archaea that use H2S instead of H20 (i.e. similar formula to w
        |ter, but with sulfur instead of oxygen). This was a major discovery and it gives a bit more weight to OP's question. 


            |Actually you're technically incorrect, too. Those life forms don't use water as an electron donor*, but they sure a
            | hell use it as a solvent in the cytosol.////Edit: if it wasn't clear, I would like to emphasize that there is **no
            |known life on earth that does not use water**. ////Edit2: oops, the chemosynths use sh2 as an electron donor! More 
            |nteresting than I had thought. In any case my point still stands


                |Not that you are wrong about sulfur-reducing bacteria need for water but water is not a terminal electron accep
                |or in any organism on earth (because in itself it is an electron donor). Water is the by-product formed when ox
                |gen acts as a terminal electron acceptor. 


                    |Ah you're right about the electron acceptor part-- thanks for correcting me. My biochem has gotten a little
                    |rusty. It's only a donor in photosynthesis though, correct? 


                |I had similar thoughts, but much less specific, and I'm glad it was you that brought this up. ////What you said
                |can't be emphasised enough. It basically snuffs out chemosynth's comment. The bacteria use H2S as an energy sou
                |ce, but their biology is still based in water, and that's a pretty important distinction. Their comment is basi
                |ally misinformation.


                |Touche! You are correct. However, I would point out that the solvent molecule is much more fungible -- really, 
                |ll you need is a proper buffer molecule. It's a lot easier to imagine life using a different solvent than it is
                |to imagine life with a different terminal electron acceptor. I imagine the solvent of choice would just be dete
                |mined by whatever appropriate molecule was most abundant. But you're absolutely right and I stand corrected. 


                |Quick question: what about certain viruses? Not to get into the whole "are they or aren't they" debate about wh
                |ther viruses are even alive --- assuming they are, can we really say the **require** water? Their life cycles a
                |e dependent on water-dependent cells, to be sure, but an individual viral particle would not die without water,
                |I think. 


            |Actually, you're wrong. You are correct that chemosynthesis doesn't use H20 the way that photosynthesis does, and t
            |at it was an important discovery, but the discovery was: 'not all life extracts it's energy from the sun', not anyt
            |ing to do with H20. Chemosynthetic archaea still need water for various life processes, just not for their energy p
            |oduction cycle.  ////Side note: H2S is only used by some chemosynthetic organisms, there are several other molecule
            | that are used by different organisms.  


                |Upvote. Thank you for correcting me.

        |I don't know, anything that doesn't look like hay?


        |Of course most of the life we know needs water, we only have experience with life on a planet covered in water. The pro
        |lem with trying to apply evolutionary theory to other planets is that we only have one case to study. Once you throw ne
        | environments and conditions into the mix it's sort of a guessing game, but I'd say looking for water is the most educa
        |ed guess.


    |Life requires complex chemistry both to exist, and be created in the first place. Chemistry only happens if chemicals are a
    |le to interact. A great way for that to happen is for the chemicals to be dissolved in something else.//Water is common, an
    | lots of chemicals are soluble in it. It's exceptionally good at dissolving things. So if life exists elsewhere, there's a 
    |ood chance it developed in water, and its chemistry would continue to require water.//So water is a good place to start loo
    |ing.


        |I read this and thought, wow! That makes sense. Then I realised your explanation includes "water is common" in a list o
        | reasons why water is likely to be involved in the development of life. So I guess it's still a good explanation of why
        |we're *looking*, but isn't there quite a bit of circular reasoning in there?


    |It's an interesting question, whether or not water is a requirement for life. It's generally accepted that, for life to occ
    |r, you need a solvent to aid in the diffusion of essential molecules. For us, water fulfills this requirement. But yes, if 
    |nly this is considered, other liquids could, as well.////Water has a very interesting, seemingly unique, property, however.
    |It's solid, frozen form is less dense than its liquid form. That is, ice floats on liquid water. This isn't true for many o
    |her substances that we know of. This is important, as it would seem easier for life to begin in a sea of whatever solvent i
    | being used, aiding the new life form in finding what it needs to survive.////But what happens with temperature changes? If
    |the temperature gets low enough to freeze the sea of solvent, and that solvent's frozen form doesn't float on the liquid, t
    |en the entire sea could freeze, and would likely kill the life form.////It also has to do with abundances. Water, being mad
    | from hydrogen and oxygen, should be more abundant than a lot of other solvents that would meet the floating requirement, s
    |mply because it's constituent atoms should be more abundant in the universe.////Finally, because of life on earth, we know 
    |hat life can exist using water as a solvent. I'm not aware of any life form being found that uses another solvent. Since we
    |know it's possible to use water, looking for water as an initial indicator makes sense.

            |Sure. We are carbon based-life. But silicon (chemically speaking) is very similar to carbon. It is very possible (a
            |d hypothesized) that silicon-based life could exist.


                |Might I take advantage in your knowledge to ask just what it is about carbon that makes it the sole element tha
                | is the basis to life on earth? 


                    |Because it bonds chemically to so many things so well (especially itself and hydrogen). See carbon chains a
                    |d hydro-carbons.


                        |Carbon's size also makes it much better at pi bonding than silicon, which is crucial for forming stable
                        |aromatic structures like those seen in DNA and RNA. Also like you said, its high electronegativity lead
                        | to very covalent, strong bonds with other carbon molecules, and with hydrogen. Si-Si bonds are much lo
                        |ger and weaker than C-C bonds.


                    |While it isn't the "why" *per se*, an interesting fact to consider when comparing Carbon to Silicon is thei
                    | abundance in the Earth's crust. [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elemen

                    | Earth's crust. And yet life on Earth still uses Carbon almost exclusively.


                |Silicon based life is incredibly unlikely. Why? Because even though silicon is *hundreds* of times more common 
                |han carbon in the Earth's crust, carbon based life evolved here and silicon based life did not.


            |Which provokes the thought 'could there be sentience without biology?'  Either original (less likely for reasons gi

    |Water is not some random chemical that we happened to evolve to use.  It is the universal solvent, it becomes less dense wh
    |n it freezes; the structure of the polar molecule and the ability to form hydrogen bonds is essential to life as we know it


        |I think this is the biggest reason. Even in inorganic chemistry, water is perhaps the most important solvent used to fa
        |ilitate chemical reactions. In the event that extraterrestrial life isn't carbon-based, there's still a good chance it 
        |elies on water to process chemicals and energy.


            |Yes.  Even if something like silicon based life were to exist (and that is really stretching it), it would need wat
            |r.  We live in a quantized universe, and a lot of people might think "well something could just evolve to use some

            |I don't think there are any prebiotic molecules on earth for silicon based life either.  Things like amino acids in

    |acid to catalyze many types of reactions)////2) It can hold of a lot of different things in it, such as salt and sugar, ess
    |ntial to life as we know it, as well as waste products of cells. (It is quite polar [i.e. has slightly positive and negativ
    |ly charged regions] and thus can dissolve nearly any molecule with a polar group on it.)////3) It is a liquid over a wide r
    |nge of temperatures, and we would expect that you'd need life to start in a liquid because you need nutrients to be able to
    |flow easily toward an organism and waste to be able to flow away. (A range of 100 degrees Celsius; ammonia is quite similar
    |to water but a liquid only in a range of ~45 degrees Celisus.)////4) It floats as a solid. (If temperatures DID dip below t
    |e freezing point, the solid phase would float and life would not be crushed or frozen inside)////5) Water is very stable an
    | hard to break apart. (Otherwise, it would rapidly disappear)////6) Water is very common in the universe compared to other 
    |olecules.//////...All of which makes it a very good place to start looking for life.////EDIT: I'm getting a few comments th

        |To add to this, there are very few other molecules that could be used as a presumably necessary solvent/medium for life
        |that would have close to these properties. The one most often considered is (liquid) ammonia, and there are no known ex
        |mples on Earth or outside of Earth (e.g. gas giants and their moons) of life existing with ammonia as the solvent/mediu
        |.


    |It's not just water. We have also noticed that we live on a planet orbiting a star, so we are mostly just looking for plane
    |s orbiting stars that have water.


    |Another reason may be that it would help future astronauts in surviving, as much as we take water for granted it's incredib
    |y important for human life and to transport large amounts into space for human consumption would be extremely expensive


    |Right, I don't know how far down I will end up on this, already old thread, but here goes:////One quality of water that hav
    |n't been mentioned yet, and if it has, I apologize. Water has, if not the highest, then at least it's among the substances 
    |ith the highest heat capacities. This means that it takes a lot more energy(heat) to change the temperature of this substan
    |e. Since life as we know it is very temperature sensitive it makes water an ample element for temperature-sensitive life to
    |thrive in. ////TLDR: Water keeps status quo for longer time than other substances which is better for life to thrive in.


    |This is really silly, but it's the only thing we can possibly look for. Our space observation systems are somewhat rudiment
    |ry compared to what you would need to take a closer look at other planets.


    |Water is often referred to as "the universal solvent", meaning many substances can dissolve into it. As we all know, most c
    |emical reactions require a solution of some kind to work. Life, essentially, is just a bunch of chemical reactions. This is
    |most likely why early organisms will always form in a "primordial soup" as it were. Thus, water is a brilliant "catalyst" t
    | life. It's not that life can only survive with water, it is just that, where there is liquid water, there is most likely l
    |fe.


    |Ammonia might be a viable alternative AFAIK


        |Viable but the window of acceptable conditions would be smaller I think.


    |Water is rocket fuel


    |Thany you so much for this question, I thougt about this so much times.


    |The discovery of water isn't just a huge find because of the possibility of finding life.  It would also make the planet a 
    |housand times easier for us to visit and/or colonize.  Remember that water can also be converted to oxygen and hydrogen (fu
    |l).


    |&gt; when other forms of life could have evolved to not need water////Is this something that we actually know, or is this s
    |eculation of something that MAY be possible, but may also be impossible?


    |cause we need it


    |It's easier to look for water (because we know what it looks like) than to look for another type of life (because we don't 
    |now what that would look like). 


    |Because while other forms of life evolving to not need water is possible in the "well, it's a big universe and we know very
    |little about it" sense, based on every piece of evidence we have, it's really not possible.  So essentially a planet with w
    |ter could quite possibly have life, and one without it is probably a barren rock just like all of the other barren rocks ou
    | there.


    |We have ZERO proven facts about life forming in fluids other than water.//We know TONS about life that uses water.////We ma
    | not know "life" but we know what we "are".  So we're looking for earth-like bio-systems because we don't have the understa
    |ding necessary to actually detect anything else.


    |Can't believe it hasn't been mentioned yet with all the Breaking Bad hype going around. But according to Walter White, its 
    |o do with the possibility of using the water as a source of Hydrogen fuel by separating it from the water. So that essentia
    |ly the planet becomes one big gas station in space for rockets. 


    |The big deal isn't about life on other planets, but effectively turning these planets into intergalactic gas stations.  See
    | hydrogen can be removed from the water and used for rocket fuel.  This limits the amount of fuel a ship would have to carr
    | for long interstellar trips.  Instead they simply pop over to the nearest gas planet and fuel up.  Water on Mars and the M
    |on are a big deal, because of their relative close proximity to us, so we could build ships in orbit, fuel them up from Moo
    |/Mars water without the need of using Earth's dwindling fuel supplies, or our own water we need here.


        |If we can power rocket ships with only water, why can't we do that with cars here on earth?


            |We can, but won't.  Two reasons put simply;////1) Big Oil companies////2) Bad idea to use water that you drink to p
            |wer cars.  We'll have clean running cars and populations dying from lack of water, with no water for bathing, cooki
            |g, etc.  That's why its a big deal to find water somewhere no one's using it.//


                |Does using water to power vehicles "destroy" the water? I know that we have a finite amount of water on earth t
                |at gets reused in a way, but I didn't know that we could destroy any amount of it permanently. The whole conser
                |ation of mass thing?


    |Most simple explanation I can think of is that we **care** about finding water on other planets because **we need** water. 
    |o finding it, oxygen, and whatever else humans need will get us closer to possibly living on other planets.


    |All life we know of is dependant on water so it makes sense to look for water, second because we depend on water finding wa
    |er on other celestial bodies it very important to not only space travel...but having it there upon our arrival is very nece
    |sary  


    |... seriously?//Ok, if all oranges you've ever seen have been orange and you are looking for oranges in a garden, wouldn't 
    |t make sense to be on the look-out for orange fruits?


        |That is an interesting example to pick, since oranges that are not yet ripe are not yet orange.


            |That makes it a perfect example. Oranges don't NEED to be orange, but if you want to increase your chances of findi
            |g an orange, you're better off narrowing your search to orange things rather than chasing after purple things, gree
            | things, brown things, etc.


            |Hmmm had not thought of that... Well why would you need oranges that are not ripe?


            |Hmmm had not thought of that... Well why would you need oranges that are not ripe?


                |To eat them if you're hungry?  For vitamins?  To learn about the biological structure of oranges?  To see if th
                |se new oranges are the same as other known oranges?  For the pulp?  For the seeds?  To use as bait?  For juice?
                |///You're not even trying...


    |One of the main important parts of finding water within our solar system, specifically looking at the inner solar system (i
    |e. Mars and the moon) is the search to find a place that may be habitable by humans in the future.


    |Because there is a population boom on the earth since humans have arrived, and well, we are taking all the resources. We ne
    |d water to live and  support our society. We also may need more space one day, look at China, we could move half of China's
    |population into Canada, and still have space. But one day that will not be the case. Finally, we want a planet that we can 
    |ove to to support our life, this needs food of any kind, water, oxygen, and an atmosphere (that kinda goes hand in hand wit
    | oxygen). ////Which we will probably destroy then have to move on like this world////Other animals have adapted to not need
    |water due to their location or loss of a resource. Example, animals that eat fish off the coast could lose eating some fish
    | so they have to live in deeper water to eat fish. This allows them to adapt to survive. Us on the other hand, we could liv
    | without water, but it would take millions of years.


        |Population is not why we want to colonize other planets. We are never going to truck masses of people off planet. The v
        |st majority of colonists will be native-born. We colonize so that one chuck of space rock doesnt wipe out everything. 


    |Im going to post this and i really don't care if anyone else said it. WE NEED WATER. We are going to mars. Make it a 2nd ho
    |e, then on to the next planets and so on till we see darth vader...  Then we blow up the moon. Waits its not a moon. 


    |As most space missions, there are multiple needs to finding water on other planets. One, yes it can support other life form
    |. Second, it can support human beings, and present itself as a colony. An earth like planet can serve as a base station for
    |further space exploration, and a logical future step in the expansion of human race to other systems. 


    |Just like anything else, we are interested in it because WE need it. When this rock is dry, we need to find a new one, we n
    |ed it to have water.


    |Planets or asteroids that contain water can act as a space gas station, as the water can be broken down and made into rocke
    | fuel.


    |First things that came to mind is that if you find planets with water (in liquid form, e.g. lakes/oceans), there could be p
    |ant life, ergo there could be other life *as we now know*. That would qualify as a place of settlement, that would also hin
    | that there might be other life *like us* somewhere, that earth is not a complete exception. However like many have pointed
    |out the needle in a haystack analogy, I'd also like to point out that human life (as far as we know) has existed only a bli
    |k of an eye. There might have been loads of civilizations before and after us, come and gone due to whatever reason.//


    |Because theoretical life that would not need water would be more complex than life that does need it. Nature loves taking t
    |e easy way. Thus water-based life should be the most common. There's even some optimistic theories that predict that water 
    |s so good for life that pretty much anywhere we find liquid water, there's a good probability of finding life.


    |We only know of life forms based off of water, so we mostly look for water as evidence of life. However, there are some the
    |ries that suggest there could be methane-based life forms on one of Saturn's moons (I believe it was Saturn). I answered a 
    |imilar ELI5 a few months back, I'll see if I can find the sources again for there being methane lakes on one of those moons


    |Well water isn't just for outside life forms but can be used for ourselves.  Hydrogen can be used for fuel to expand furthe
    | space travel and water is a necessity for when we want to survive outside of our planet in a sustainable environment.


        |There is almost literally no planet with no hydrogen on it, there are sources other than water for it.////Also, if we d
        |velop the tools to travel to other worlds, chances are we can bring technology to create water if there is hydrogen and
        |oxygen present (which there probably will be) merely using solar power.


    |If we were to live on Mars we need water, we can't just bring it all with us.


    |Because hydrogen is most abundant element in the universe and oxygen is third abundant, it is logical to expect that also m
    |st other lifeforms if not all are somehow depended of water which is a compound of those two elements. The second most abun
    |ant element helium is inert and does not make stable compounds with other elements.


    |Plus, would we even know what life that doesn't need water, looks like? Maybe we look for that because we what what it coul
    | look like. Just a thought.


    |Because we are looking for a place to expand and colonize our own species and we need water.


    |Why do we take the elevator instead of climbing up the outside of the building? If you don't see an elevator at first your 
    |hought isn't, fuck it, I'll scale this shit. It's, there has to be an elevator around here somewhere.


    |Imagine that water on other planets is equivalent to oil on Earth. We want water there so we can go there and use it so we 
    |on't have to stay on earth and use all of our water. 


    |I think we're also looking for the possibility of colonization of other planets, besides just life.


    |I've read somewhere that for carbon-based lifeforms you simply must have water.  Only in water can complex biochemistry wor
    |.  The water molecules, with their mild polarity, are what hold the complex organic molecules in shape, and there is no oth
    |r liquid that can pull off the same trick.


        |But what if other forms of life aren't even made up of the complex organic molecules we know to exist?


            |That's the point. There might be life made up of other building blocks but we have absolutely no idea how this woul
            | work. So searching for completely different lifeforms would mean that we don't even know what to look for.////Inst
            |ad we are only looking for stuff we know life can form in (e.g. water, carbon, moderate temperatures etc.). While i
            | might not be the only way to form life, it still is the only proven way.


    |This bugs me too. Especially because right here in our own backyard we have intelligent creatures that we do not communicat
    | with.////It blew my mind to find out that elephants can paint for instance. And yet we harvest them for their tusks.////Ou
    | species is really arrogant and looks down on anything that isn't like us. Then the real psychos among us exploit and destr
    |y that thing we looked down on.////


    |I think that it will be life that could be potentially similar to that on earth, thus we would know how to deal with it. If
    |it wasn't, it could be not only dangerous but rather useless, since it doesn't correspond with any of our understandings of
    |"life"


    |We're not just looking for other life out there, we're looking for signs that we would also be able to survive in other pla
    |es.  If we really win the jackpot we'll be able to find another habitable planet with life already on it, that we could get
    |to in a relatively short amount of time.


    |One of my past professors once said something along the lines of "Wherever we find water on Earth, even in extreme temperat
    |res, there's been signs of life in it." ////Whether that is factual or not (having not done any exhaustive research, myself
    |, it makes sense to search for water on distant planets if we are looking for signs of verifiable life, assuming life appro
    |ches 1 in water on Earth.


    | Do you learn calculus before addition? no? well now you know why they look for water not other chemical compounds. Water i
    | the simplest chemical compound, or solvent, in what makes up life.  Without a solvent you have a pile of chemicals. You st
    |rt with the basics and move up from that in everything mate.


    |Moreover, in addition to the awesome comments already here, I think its important to point out that the more general reason
    |for seeking water is that *we* need water to survive, thus if we were to pursue the colonization of another planet we would
    |need water. I think that has a lot more to do with the search for water than proving/disproving the existence of life on ot
    |er planets. 


    |Even if life itself does not require water (or carbon for that matter), life that we believe we may have the ability to int
    |ract with may require water. That is to say, a sulfur-based life form might require extreme temperatures or pressures to 'l
    |ve' and we do not have a place where we can meet and interact.


    |We care about liquid water on other planets in the hope that one day we Humans can physically go there and perhaps colonize
    |////1) Physical Exploration//2) Physical colonization//3) The inspiration of our species regarding our collective future


    |Life doesn't *use* water. Life, as we know it, is made of water. Making life without water (imagining we knew enough to cre
    |te life) would be like trying to make ice cubes without water.


    |water is an unique fluid, because it's most dense at 4^o C (above its freezing point), and ice is slightly less dense than 
    |verage temperature water, even less dense than warm water. so in low temperatures it will shield itself with ice on the top
    | and keep reasonably warm and liquid below it.////that is a bit of unnatural behavior amongs known substances. solid form i
    | least dense, liquid form at one specific temperature is the most dense. this makes big water pools fairly resistant to fre
    |zing completely.////that allowed it to sustain life even in cold temperatures - ice would float on top of it. even in very 
    |old conditions, it would always keep a layer of ~4^o C water at the lower areas. this makes it a very effecive environment 
    |or sustaining life.////and this property makes it very appealing towards hosting various life forms, at least in early stag
    |s of their development.


    |one day this planet, without a doubt, is going to die.//if we are going to colonize another planet, its going to have to ha
    |e water.


    |The chemical properties of water are unique. ////Water is composed of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen H2O. Oxygen i
    | the second best oxidizing element next to fluorine but oxygen has the capacity to bond to two elements whereas fluorine on
    |y one. Thus oxygen can covalently bind to compounds in molecules that make up the building blocks of living things and be i
    |volved in oxidation tasks. In the form of water it can both to bind or donate fuels. ////Hydrogen is the simplest and most 
    |bundant elemental fuel. Oxidizing (burning) hydrogen produces energy resulting in water. Water has some of the most remarka
    |le chemical properties of any known substance. ////Water is responsible for the folding of proteins and other macromolecule
    | in life into functional structures. No other abundant chemical substance has this kind of effect, known as the hydrophobic
    |effect. ////Water has long range structural properties than allow complex chemical interactions necessary for life to take 
    |lace via hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and dynamic order-disorder interactions that are not possible with any other abun
    |ant solvent. The dynamically changing combination of oxygen and hydrogen in water allows rapid chemical reactions to take p
    |ace without completely overwhelming the structures that are necessary for life. 


    |I have always thought the search for water was just the viability of future colonization. //


    |For fuel. Hydrogen and oxygen from water is rocket fuel for the next lift-off. 


    |One thing to consider in a very generalized search for life, is what are the odds that other life exists on the same timesc
    |le as us? There could be life occurring at time scales orders of magnitudes faster or slower than our life, crystal based l
    |fe forms on some rock in space might be just as sentient as us on a larger time scale.


    |Two things come to my mind: First, water is so reactive that any living thing will probably be forced to incorporate it in 
    |ome way if it is present. At the same time, that means it is easy for biological processes to utilize it. Secondly, life th
    |t utilizes water will be easiest for us to recognise as living, since all the life on earth deals with it in some way.////


    |Scientists are interested in water on other planets (including comets, asteroids) because we're water based life forms and 
    |f we travel to space then being able to find local water supplies is invaluable. And we don't have to take a lifetime of wa
    |er with us (despite how well we can recycle).//Plus where's there's water there could be life, alien life.


    |Because we **know** water at liquid-temperature can produce abundant and diverse life. If there's a lot of liquid water, it
    |looks more likely that there will be life.


    |Water makes great rocket ship fuel.


    |Because everywhere on Earth we find water, we find life.  Although the reasoning is admittedly rooted in inductive logic (l
    |ok at this one planet, bet all the others are that way!), it is the only place we have from which to proceed.  We could pos
    |ibly add other compounds to the list of what we should be looking for, but we'd have to spend a LOT more time and money on 
    |biogenetic research.  


    |Basically because we're looking for planets similar to ours that may have life on them that have evolved or will evolve sim
    |lar to how life evolved here.  Don't forget that we're carbon-based lifeforms but we're mostly made up of water.


    |So here we go//The abundance of various chemicals in the universe //http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_
    |lements////We know that Hydrogen is most abundant, with Oxygen and Carbon being the next ones.////Well let's look at human 
    |omposition.  We as humans and most mammals have similiar percentages, we are mostly water,  H2O with guess what Hydrogen an
    | Oxygen being the most 2 common elements////And guess what, Carbon is the most chemically active element in all of the pero
    |ioc tables.//////So considering the life we have seen are based upon 3 of the most abundant elements, (we ignore helium bec
    |use its inert, doesn't react) ////So its safe to say that we are made from the same stuff the universe is made from.  Thus 
    |he universe is in us.////Its safe to assume that we being the most common things.  That if we find other life, that its lik
    |ly to come from common things.////Most likely carbon based life form, because life is complex and carbon is complex and hig
    |ly reactive.//////Does this mean, all life form is carbon based, Nope!  life could be something else all together!!  //Coul
    | life have sprouted out of non 'common' elements.  Sure!  ////////But we usually target the low hanging fruit.//////Almost 
    |ll life we have ever seen and witnessed, typically thrive and do quite well or need water to survive, which isn't surprisin
    | considering that water, is Hydrogen and Oxygen and are some of the most common elements.//// //////////


    |because humans are self-centered assholes


    |We actually have found life forms in lava which live without water. 


    |Scientists are very aware that life elsewhere might be very different from life here on Earth. However, the problem is how 
    |e would ever be able to find that life. Extraterrestrial "life" could be extremely long-lived rock beings or other crazy th
    |ngs that we would have no ability to interact with or even recognize as being alive. So in order to narrow our search to so
    |ething somewhat possible, we look for one thing that all life as we know it requires--water--in the hopes that, if we find 
    |ife elsewhere, it will be similar enough to life on Earth that we can have a decent chance of communicating with them and u
    |derstanding them.//// Also, knowing which other planets have water and are potentially habitable will be very useful if and
    |when humanity starts colonizing beyond Earth


        |So all rocks are aliens? Cool.


    |So far, most of these answers are right. But to add to it all. We survive on water. With water, we can live on the planet. 
    |f the life we look for is anywhere as relevant as our life, we can actually survive on that planet and meet these species. 
    |he needle in a haystack metaphor is a great way of looking at it as well. We don't really know life other than our own and 
    |he animals on this planet.


    |..is it possible for life forms to exist without water? that boggles me


    |Because we need water, and life sustaining planets + water = We can live there.////Bit obvious, surely


    |vghmj


    |Or you mean why do we care so much about water on other planets when we dump toxic waste and our shit into it at a rate tha
    | would make your mind melt. Oblivion is happening right now keep buying the cool brands and backing your government who sol
    | out in the 1940's. Wake up!!


    |We're looking for water because most life we know depends on water. Therefor water=life. They also search for planets that 
    |s the same/right distance from a star so it can have an atmosphere.////There is a teenie weenie little problem with this lo
    |ic however. //ALL life we know is on earth(and that's more than just "most". Earth is kinda known for it's abundance of wat
    |r. We even call it the blue planet. Now, we just so happen to know that life evolve and adapt to its surroundings. ////Extr
    |mofiles are considered to be one, if not the, earliest known forms of life on earth. Extremofile means they can survive ext
    |eme conditions like very high temperatures. But it goes beyond just being able to survive it, they usually thrive in it, as
    |the extreme heats offers a plentiful source of energy much like the sun. Many extremofiles are anaerobe; they require no ox
    |gen. ////So, early life didn't necessarily depend on water, oxygen. sunlight, or even an atmosphere. Then life evolved,  le
    |rned to utilize the most accessible resources on earth aswell as its other conditions. ////We even know that most life on e
    |rth lives under water. Life could easily have developed under ice, on a planet without an atmosphere. We know this, but in 
    |ur collective minds, most life requires an atmosphere with oxygen and sun cause thats whats right infront of us. ////Now, b
    |yond the sarcasm, I don't actually believe that researchers are so stupid as to actually believe in this sort of logic. But
    |as with everything else, it has a market value. Finding life is a witch hunt. Even if there is any, the odds we'll find it 
    |ven in many lifetimes from now is so low that its at best misleading or a half-truth to say it even exists. Their products 
    |re hope and curiosity(which by the way is the name of NASA's Mars rover) and excitement. They sell an idea that life COULD 
    |xist and that there are planets that are much like ours, which without mentioning it would suggest that there would always

    |Because my great-great^222 grandson might need to bail the eff out of this planet when a meteorite comes to hit this planet
    | And since Bruce Willis will be too dead to blow it up in space again, I suggest we invest in some space real estate before
    |its value shoots up due to the construction of the Death Star.


    |There could certainly be life out there that has evolved without water but all we have to go off of is the life thats on ea
    |th which needs water. We need some sort of foundation and direction when looking for life, partly because our galaxy alone 
    |s very big, full of stars that likely have multiple planets. 


    |We have to start somewhere. Also, our tools are designed to detect and work with what we know.

    |Agreed (OP I see some value in your point).////To actually answer the question let me just say; TERAFORMING!!!


    |I myswlf have wondered this, especially with organisms that aren't carbon based, but recently I've thought of this-//Our ba
    |ic evolutionary understanding puts organisms that use anaerobic respiration (not using oxygen) at a very limited growth. Th
    |s is because anaerobic respiration produces way less ATP (energy) than aerobic respiration. That being said, where there is
    |water, there is a good chance there is or at least used to be oxygen, and we can possibly find things other than microorgan
    |sms. Also, like the top commemt says, most organisms, aerobic or not, need some water, as far as we know. We simply don't k
    |ow how life could function otherwise so there's nothing to look for. 


    |Because that is how you get publicity and funding.


    |I can't believe that none of the top comments mention this. We are running out of pure drinkable water and it takes tons of
    |energy to purify it. 


    |Because WE need water. And our planet will die once our sun gets bigger


    |Probably because WE can't use it if it doesn't have water...  As far as I know, we're exploring to find stuff we can use...
    |Finding other life is NOT our current goal...


    |Because we need water fool


    |There is also importance not regarding life. Obviously water is made of hydrogen and oxygen. We would be able to use the se
    |arated elements for certain things, like hydrogen being used as fuel. In Breaking Bad they make the analogy that Mars would
    |essentially be a gas station. Going back to using it for life, with water we would be able to put small organisms (like alg
    |e and what not) so they slowly begin to adapt to the atmosphere. Over time we would be able to put larger plants on Mars an
    | begin to create a livable atmosphere.


        |This is not true at all. Mars lacks a magnetosphere, which is what allows Earth to retain an atmosphere. Any atmospheri
        | gases we generated on Mars would dissipate instead of becoming an atmosphere. 


            |It would take a couple thousand years for the gasses to dissipate IIRC, so there's a bit of leeway.
