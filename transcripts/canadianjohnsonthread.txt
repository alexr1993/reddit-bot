"I missed my family..." -Laura, age 12. The Church of Scientology fought hard so that these documents would never see the light of day. After signing a billion year contract, Laura was working 8:30 am to 12:30 am, seven days a week. That’s 112 hours a week. At thirteen.(/r/World News)




    |Reading this just leaves a pit in my stomach. How can such an organization be allowed to continue to abuse it's members in 
    |uch a way? This has to be illegal: labor laws, anti-coercion laws, blackmail...


        |&gt; How can such an organization be allowed to continue to abuse it's members in such a way?////Because there's a lot 
        |f money involved and key manipulators in the right places.


            |Also whenever anyone criticizes them they pull the "OMG FREEDOM OF RELIGION YOU ARE COMMITTING A HATE CRIME", and t
            |en threaten, blackmail the critic involved and sue them with the full might of their legal arm.


                |It's the USA fallacy, their freedom to choose removes their freedom to choose as organisations and people take 
                |dvantage of it.////Funny to watch, less funny to experience.


                    |It's also worth pointing out that under CoS rule if you defect or try to go against the church you are "fai
                    | game" - meaning they sanction and promote destroying the person/people/organisation speaking out against t
                    |em. That's some scary shit.


                        |Let's not forget they also managed to infiltrate tons of different things including the IRS in [Operati

                                |Because of their money and stars like cruise they are able to buy and schmooze their way to pol

                            |They also got their tax exempt status after a number of Scientologists went into a meeting with the
                            |head of the IRS, and he came out and changed their status. For an organisation with a history of bl
                            |ckmailing people, I consider this highly suspicious.


                                |should be noted, this was after the fallout of snow white.


                            |Let's also not forget that American Evangelicals are actively infiltrating all levels of government
                            | media, and entertainment. Dominionists exist in this country, right now, but clearly Scientology i

        |I believe any contract involving a minor can be invalidating because of their age. Then again, the "billion year contra

        |No contract entered into with a minor, especially a 12 year old, would be enforceable due to the fact that she cannot l
        |gally give her consent. Adding into the equation that she "agreed" to work for a billion years would just show to a jud
        |e that she lacked the requisite ability to understand what she was doing. (But as already pointed out, this doesn't inv

        |Okay I have to ask. How would a bot work this way? I am taking a programming class and I don't understand how this coul
        | work. Is it actually a bot or just some person? I apologize if this is a dumb question to ask.


            |There are algorithms that attempt to determine the most significant portions of a body of text.  I've heard them ca
            |led "auto-highlighting" algorithms, IIRC.  But I've never seen one that consistently does a good job when it's fed 
            |ews articles, school papers, etc.  For instance, you'd have no idea what this article was about if you only read th
            | three facts that bitofnewsbot picked out.////edit: Found a [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automa
            |ic_summarization).  Bitofnews.com is apparently using [this](https://www.mashape.com/mojojolo/textteaser#!documenta
            |ion).


                |Or maybe it's not a bot...


                    |I would bet money that it is.  ////edit: If you go to bitofnews.com, it says it's using [this](https://www.
                    |ashape.com/mojojolo/textteaser#!documentation) to do the summarization.


                |With no evidence to back this I would assume that a program purses through the article 'highlighting' words tha
                | appear in the title. Other stuff too, like numbers of deaths, dates.


            |You won't learn this in a programming class, but you will in a machine learning class (typically a graduate level c
            |urse), though this particular problem doesn't take much to solve decently well. Here's a method that works pretty w
            |ll and doesn't require any complicated algorithms or math:////* Break up the title and article into individual word
            |, and count how many times each word appears. Use that to produce a list of the top 10 (or some other number) words
            |that appear in the article.////* Assign each sentence a score as follows:////- 3 points for every word in the sente
            |ce that's also in the title of the article////- 3 points for every word in the sentence that's in the list of top 1
            | words from that article////- 1 point for each word in the sentence (to prefer longer sentences)////- Plus between 
            | and 1 points for how far down the article the sentence appears (1 point for being the first sentence, 0 for being 
            |he last, some percentage if it's in-between)////Now take the 3 sentences with the highest score, and you have a sum
            |ary.////Something like that. The scores were mostly made up, but if you tweaked them you wouldn't have a terrible s
            |mmary most of the time. You'll get similar results to this bot; it's also just picking sentences from the article, 
            |ot writing its own.


            |Apparently it takes the first sentence of the first paragraph, some in the middle (I imagine is based on the length
            |of the article) and the first sentence of the last paragraph.


            |This isn't a dumb question.  Here's a really easy way to think about it.  ////Imagine you're going to write this bo
            |.  The easiest way to start is to just write something that picks out a random selection of sentences from the arti
            |le.  //You can judge how well the bot does by checking how many upvotes and downvotes it gets.  Next you need to ma
            |e it able to adjust to feedback and in order to do that you need a way to tell what kind of sentences contribute to
            |a good score and what kind of sentences contribute to bad scores.  //An easy way to do this is to keep a dictionary
            |where each word gets +1 when it appears in a comment that goes positive and -1 when it appears in a comment that go
            |s negative.  You can even make the amount of points the word gets depend on how well or poorly the comment does.  /
            |So now, instead of choosing sentences at random you can simply add up the value of words for each sentence and choo
            |e the ones with the highest scores.  Over time, user votes will teach the program how to select useful extracts fro
            | any article.  //There are lots of ways you can make this even better, for instance you can keep a different dictio
            |ary for each major genre (politics, sports, etc) because different words are going to have different relevance per 
            |ubject.  ////Source: BCMS specialising in datamining and machine learning.

        |You would think that but our justice system has no logic and scientology has been successful in court or quietly settle

    |Come out of the closet Tom.

        |They believe their soul lives on for billions of years. So your are agreeing that in all life forms you will continue y

    |On the one hand, there is no way that such a contract has legal power.////On the other hand, its not like Scientology would

    |////Better still, boycott his crap movies.


        |You do realize that celebrities aren't only recognized in their country of birth, right? Clearly you recognize him and 
        |ou aren't American. Tom Cruise is an A-lister. That means he is recognized and "feted" around the globe. Stop blaming t
        |e American people for something your country is probably equally guilty of. 


            |Made in America. The American movie industry threatened Australian politicians with sanctions if your movie industr
            | and its associated industries did not get special, direct access to our markets. Please, you forget how powerful y
            |u Americans are, just powerful enough to bully your allies but not enough to get rid of scientology.


                |To be fair, we haven't gotten rid of Scientology yet either.////We need to follow the example of the Germans, r
                |fuse to recognize them as a religion (because they're not a legitimate religion they're a dodgy business at bes
                | and a criminal organization at worst) and have the government publicly warn against them.

                    |igions


                        |Not really... You say 'most religions' without understanding the scope of how many religions exist and 
                        |hat their doctrines are. Very few religions are run like corporations. Buddhism, paganism (using an umb

                |e/tt1182345/?ref_=fn_al_tt_6) is so good you should buy it. It deserves every cent.


            |I liked it better when it was called [Battle Angel Alita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Angel_Alita)


        |This is just my opinion and it's not because I think highly of Tom Cruise or even like at all as a person or entertaine
        | because neither of those are true for me. ////But I could honestly buy the fact that Tom Cruise probably has no idea o
        | any of the crazy (illegal) things that go on there. When or if he even reads or hears things like this I wouldn't be s
        |rprised if he writes it off as propaganda from non scientologists to slander or discredit his "religion". ////I'm stric
        |ly talking about the really extreme things mainly illegal. I'm sure he is purvey to all those crazy "programs" and the 
        |ther controversial things they force upon their members to make them better scientologists/human-beings, but I'm sure i
        | his warped mind he probably truly believes they work and that those people receiving them desperately need them. I do 
        |hink it's really screwed up and sad that someone with so much influence is involved in and advocates for such a horribl
        | organization. 


            |It's more likely that the nut-cult has blackmail info on Tom Cruise that he's not willing to expose.


                |It's certainly a possibility at this point. Even if  he is still there willingly it wouldn't surprise me at all
                |if they had some kind of dirt on for the just in case scenario. 


        |John Travolta is a scientoligist too. 


            |Qantas trained him to Captain grade on the 747. Absolutely wrong. The uproar within Qantas was deafening, but hey t

        |&gt; He is No: 2 in this evil shit and you treat him like a God. ////This might shock you to learn, but not all America
        |s are in charge of deciding who stars in what movie. Like, not even most people who live in California get to do that./


            |Tom Cruise is a celebrity. He goes on numerous talk shows and is treated with celebrity acclaim. He has hollywood p
            |wer I believe. ////So as a generalisation to say he is treated like a god maybe poetic licence but it doesn't imply
            |every single american adores him. You chose to be literal and naive when it suits. ////So is he top of the movie / 
            |ollywood tree - Yes. //Is he idolised sufficiently to air on various TV programmes. Yes.////If you spend more of yo
            |r time denouncing what is wrong with Cruise as a scientologist then that is one way how public opinion is formed. I
            |don't have a problem with that. But you with your butt hurt choses to make a martyr of yourself and your country in

        |He can't even act. 


            |As much as I dislike him for his beliefs and associations, I disagree with you. If there's one thing he can do, it'
            | act. He's a smug, insecure, power trippy pretty boy. But he's a pretty decent actor.  I was so torn when I found o
            |t he was in Tropic Thunder. He looked familiar, but I didn't know it was him until the credits. I felt like I was t
            |icked into enjoying his performance.


                |Well Tropic Thunder is probably his best movie.//


                    |I'd argue A Few Good Men is his best movie.


                    |I liked him in Interview with a Vampire. I tell myself it's okay to enjoy it because it's before the crazy

                    |Do you watch movies?


                    |The latest Mission Impossible is dope. He made some great early movies too.


                |Tom Cruise is a skilled actor. Anything he is in is probably worth watching. The guy has three oscar nomination
                |. This is the guy in Rain man, Magnolia, Interview with the vampire, Jerry Maguire and Born on the fourth of ju

    |Once again, I am writing in response to The Church of Scientology's stratagems, and once again, I merely wish to point out 
    |hat The Church of Scientology has lost contact with reality. The full truth of my conclusion I shall develop in the course

    |when it says that it is a spokesman for God.////In contrast, I am not a robot. I am a thinking, feeling, human being. As su

    |I'm so eager to tell you that The Church of Scientology has commented that the Queen of England heads up the international

    |/No matter how bad you think The Church of Scientology's vaporings are, I assure you that they are far, far worse than you

    |without hearing The Church of Scientology talk about caciquism, you're either deaf, dumb, or in a serious case of denial. T

    | for worldwide egoism without anyone stopping it. How long can that go on? As long as its homophobic artifices are kept on 
    |ife support. That's why we have to pull the plug on them and create a world in which interdenominationalism, recidivism, an
    | stoicism are all but forgotten. Let me point out that the reader who has followed me through this lengthy comment will hav
    | been able to gather an idea of The Church of Scientology's general character and disposition. Hence, I shall conclude simp

                        |It is not a damn competition. They are both horrendous acts. The difference is that one entire religion
                        | scientology, finds it acceptable. There are absolutely no sane Christians who think child rape is acce

                    |Do you really not understand that this is not widespread slavery, and that child rape is much worse? 


                        |It is not widespread only because scientology is not widespread, and tries to cover it up OUTSIDE of it
                        | own organization.////But then again, I am arguing on reddit here...


                            |Child molestation, among many other atrocities, are widespread, and are actively covered up OUTSIDE
                            |of their own organizations by the leadership of said religions. ////I think Scientology is awful. S

                            |ugh. It is simply socially acceptable to hate Scientology, whereas other religions are granted a le

                                |Name one good thing that scientology does////Do you know what the catholic church has, and is s
                                |ill, doing?////^^^raping ^^^children////No, I mean the big charities, the part where they tried
                                |to keep europe stable and knowledge safe for thousands of years, and the part where they try to
                                |actively spread their gospel, instead of asking money for it.////But no, they're obviously "jus
                                | as bad".


                                    |Everything the church does is to further their agenda. None of their good deeds come withou
                                    | strings attached. The bit of good they do will never outweigh the horrible things they do.
                                    |I get that you view the world through Christian tinted glasses (most Americans do, even man
                                    | atheists I know), but that does not make Scientology worse than the rest. A slightly diffe
                                    |ent shade of evil is still evil. 


                        |Not widespread? You do realize it is part if their faith, this sea org? The orders for it come from the
                        |r leader. Child rape is horrendous and those persons should be held accountable and are. No faith says 
                        |hat it is ok or orders it done.


                            |Compared to child molestation (again, this is naming one atrocity of modern religion, we can add to
                            |this list if you insist)? It is not even close. They do not have enough members to make it close. S
                            |rry, it just isn't. What about child rape being covered up all the way to the top of the Catholic C
                            |urch are you failing to recognize? These were not isolated incidents pal. Sorry if I am not making 
                            | distinction between condoning (their coverups condone those actions, and that is a fact) something
                            |awful, and ordering it. 


                    |Do you really not understand why child rape is REALLY REALLY WORSE?


                        |Well, since its not, no.////Maybe rape is something that hits you closer to home, since it could happen
                        |to you, but slavery is definitely the bigger evil, even if its impossible for you to comprehend.


                            |Slavery in the sense your thinking, yes. forcing a 12 year old to work 90 hours a week is deffinite
                            |y not worse than raping an infant.


            |It has also been named the most abusive and harmful sect in the world by people who study it. I don't belong to any
            |religion but I would have no fear joining one of the main religions with the intention of attending their religous 
            |ervice a couple of times and then quitting. Something I don't think I would dare do with scientology.


            |so given a few decades maybe scientology will be less crazy coo coo. though at the same time there are extremists i
            | every religion and most religions have some sort of crazy coo coo belief in them.////it's clear scientology does s
            |me pretty horrendous shit, but so does the catholic church. they protected child rapists, moved them around to evad
            | prosecution. do we then dismantle the catholic church as well? this is the problem with any freedom, you have to t
            |ke the good with the bad. are there limits obviously. what's needed is regulation of some sort. deem certain things
            |as just not covered under freedom of religion. we already do this, we just need more rules to be added and better l
            |ws that allow prosecution of religious organizations.


                |OK. So we should just let it go then? It's not like people ignore the things that are wrong that the catholic c
                |urch does. People speak out against it including Catholics themselves. The difference being that the catholic c
                |urch however misguided sometimes does do good. They run programs and help people. Members try to do good in the
                |world often asking little in return. I can't say the same of Scientology.


        |Religious freedom + wealth = lawyers.////A small time cult can't get away with anything, a big time cult can get away w
        |th everything.


        |I personally can't think of any other large religion that currently (historically is not a valid comparison) that forbi
        |s followers from seeing families, takes children out if school and works them 120 weeks. They certainly don't hire inve
        |tigators to torture ex followers for years on end (read about monique rathbun, only one example) to destroy them. No ot
        |ers have infiltrated the government and been arrested for it. Scientology is much, much worse than any others. Hollywoo
        | stars in particular are drawn in and it has become mainstream through them. ////Don't bother trying to tell the truth 
        |n them, they will hire investigators and make up websites to smear your reputation. It is actually in their handbook of
        |beliefs to destroy anyone who they feel is a threat. ////Reporters are terrified to cover it and even lawyers refuse to
        |sue because they are afraid of what scientology does. That type of power no other cult would get away with.


            |Not to sit the pot but I put scientologists and jehovas witnesses on the same level of crazy. 


        |It doesn't matter who does it, if it happens in the US jurisdiction, the US govt should be acting. Talking about things
        |the other religions have done in the long past doesn't matter, and is no concern of the US courts (unfortunately). If t
        |e WBC, Catholic Church, or Quakers were doing the same things as the CoS in the US, they would be legally smote so fast
        | ////The Church of Scientology has way too much power. Way too much.


            |&gt; If the WBC, Catholic Church, or Quakers were doing the same things as the CoS in the US, they would be legally
            |smote so fast.////I dunno, one cop got his career destroyed, and a national royal enquiry has had to have been laun
            |hed, over the coverups by the catholic church here in Australia, where over decades not one case of child abuse rep
            |rted to catholic leaders was given to the police.


                |But that was hundreds of...days ago! Clearly Scientology is the only religion run by evil men. Clearly they are
                |the only religion who prey on the powerless to further their agendas. ////The fucking sad part is most people I
                |encounter actually believe that shit. SMFH


                |No but the point is they were caught and were brought to justice. It is not acceptable and the believers, gover
                |ments and media have no problem holding feet to the fire to punish them. No one is even touching the scientolog
                | thing because they are afraid of being the next Paulette Cooper!


                |The Catholic Church is up there with the Scientology... Is it a church? I forget the term they use for their pa
                |ticular brand of crazy.


        |I have to check myself whenever I m tempted to ridicule scientoogy for this reason.  Objectively speaking, I don't thin
        | it's any more far-fetched than any other religion.


            |To an extent I do agree with you, trying to apply logic to any religion just doesn't work;hence, faith.  But at the
            |moment I think scientology is the worst of them in terms of the blatantly illegal shit they do and the amount of pu
            |l they have in the government.  


                |Dunno...I can think of one religion where they believe God himself personally gifted believers a large tract of
                |land in the middle East.  I'm pretty sure in a pissing contest scientology wouldn't even be able to reach the u
                |inal.


                    |Apples, oranges. Historic comparisons do not count. There was once slavery in the United States, too. Blami
                    |g the government for something that long ago to prove a point would not be acceptable. It is the same for r
                    |ligions. We are talking about now, what can and is being done, now. Scientology would definitely win a piss
                    |ng contest on their tactics now. Even reporters are scared to cover it. No other religion would get away wi
                    |h using fear tactics against innocent persons. One example, Pauletter Cooper http://www.paulettecooper.com/
                    |candal1.htm. More recently Tony has covered lots but Monique Rathbun stands out.


                    |Sorry, in the US I meant at this moment in time.  It's also debatable whether the things christians are doi
                    |g are causing more harm since its so much more widespread.  Denying climate change, making it harder to get
                    |safe abortions, dramatically increasing accidental pregnancies and then forcing you to bring it to term etc
                    |..


                        |Yeah...I think I'll let this sleeping dog lie and just agree with you about scientology :)


                            |I like how you have to "check yourself before you ridicule scientology" but don't mind thinly veile
                            | disdain towards another religion, great job.


        |who cares. any person who believes in religion is weak minded and stupid. not enough aids in the world looooool


            |i agreed with you untill that last sentence where i realised your iq must barely be above double digits


                |you agreed with the who cares bit, sooo there is just no form of empathy at all here?
