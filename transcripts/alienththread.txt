The day of games is nigh - ExtraLife marathon(/r/The official reddit blog)




    |Anyone doing this from Northern Minnesota and is interested in being on the news?


    |If anyone has any questions regarding the event, please be sure to check out the thread from the original post: http://www.
    |eddit.com/r/blog/comments/1kcxbw/its_that_time_again_extra_life_gaming_marathon/////Several folks from Children's Miracle N
    |twork answered quite a few questions there, so it will likely prove helpful.


        |Love you guys.


        |Is there an age restriction on doing this?


            |There is no age restriction. For more info see [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/10gurp/join_us_to_play_
            |ames_and_heal_kids_extra_life/c6dfqnm?context=2) comment from the event last year.


    |This will be the 5th year I've been participating in the marathon, and it has been a blast every year. It is an amazing eve
    |t for a very worthwhile charity. Some important things I'd like to point out:////* [**100% of the money you raise goes dire
    |tly to the hospitals**](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1kcxbw/its_that_time_again_extra_life_gaming_marathon/cbnnvti
    |. The way ExtraLife works allows for all of the funds raised to go directly to the hospitals without incurring any overhead
    |costs.////* [**The money raised by ExtraLife goes directly towards helping kids**](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1k
    |xbw/its_that_time_again_extra_life_gaming_marathon/cbnouwo). It can't be used on things like administrative costs.////* You
    |get to choose which hospital you want to raise money for. This allows you to raise money specifically for kids in the area 
    |ou choose.////Even if you think there is no way you could raise money, [join and give it a try](https://www.extra-life.org/
    |ndex.cfm?fuseaction=register.start&amp;eventID=512&amp;teamID=10487). You'd be surprised how often friends and family are w
    |lling to donate to worthy causes.


        |If we have ties to a local hospital is there any way to include them in the charity?


            |It looks like any hospital that's part of the Children's Miracle Network are included.


            |You can specify a nearby CMN hospital. 


    |Not to be confused with http://extralives.org/


        |I can't confuse the two so long as I have my trusty bootknife!


        |Hehe


            |Heh. 


    |Hey, I remember watching the first time you guys did this. Was it Kemitche who was playing Dark Souls that time? Any plans 
    |n doing streaming direct from the console, or is it going to be a webcam again?


        |He was! Not sure if we're going to be streaming from the office again this year.////Many of us will be online in the [r
        |ddit ExtraLife steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ExtraLife-reddit/). Feel free to hit us up there if you'd 
        |ike to play anything :)


            |Heh, yeah I remember he had the "brilliant" idea of going through the game with no weapons except fist weapons. But
            |the problem is no character starts with those, so he had to beat the first boss with his fists alone. Took FOREVER,
            |and he regretted it immensely but pride lept him going :p


                |That run was soooooo painful. But making it to the vendor that sold fist weapons felt soooooo good. 


                    |Are you doing it again this year? I need to throw my money at someone local. 


                        |Unfortunately I'm skipping it this year. I'm hoping to have time for it next year though! 


        |24 hours of dark souls? Holy shit. If he's doing that again this year, he can have my money. 


    |Hey guys I was thinking about doing this, and I have a few questions.////* Do we stream on Twitch? Or how does that work? /
    |* All the donations are done via a link I'm guessing right? //* What is a typical Fundraising Goal?//* Can we stream any ga
    |e? I was thinking about doing DotA2, FFXIV and (maybe) Pokemon Y if I can get a [3DS Capture Tool](http://3dscapture.com/)/
    |* What tools do you use to stream? Does [OBS](http://obsproject.com/) work well with Twitch?////Thanks!


        |1. Doesn't matter, whichever is best for you. I've found Twitch to be the most reliable.////2. Just link people to your
        |personal donation page on the Extra Life website, and they can donate from there.////3. Depends on what you expect. $10
        | may be good if you're just getting money from family and friends.////4. Sure, doesn't really matter.////5. I'm using O
        |S this year. It's supposed to work well with Twitch.


    |I love that events like this are supported by Reddit. Makes me glad to be a part of the community! ‎ʘ‿ʘ


        |I love having an excuse to play video games for 25 hours straight whilst donating money to charity. Can't beat that!


        |We did it reddit!


            |[deleted]


                |Go back to /r/metaphoricalwormpls, you.


                    |I want popularity :( 


                        |You'll get nothing and you'll like it


                            |Nothing like ever before


    |This is my first year! I'll be livestreaming and also [raffling off steam games](http://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraLife/comments
    |1o8fqg/steam_game_raffles_for_1_extra_life_fundraising/) for anyone who donates 1 dollar or more!


    |Pfft, you call 25 hours of  gaming a *marathon?*


        |I'd call 25 hours of gaming 'a light warm-up'...


            |Nay, a breather.


        |I did 36 once, never want to go back there..//I think I used my extra life then.


            |Did close to 80 a couple years back playing COD for charity. Only raised $186 :(. 


            |I did this once as well when Guild Wars 2 first released. I only regret the diarrhea that I'm pretty sure that 6-ho
            |r energy shot gave me.


                |They're not suppositories, dude


                    |The directions were unclear!


    |I can't wait!  I've assembled a kick ass team, loaded up on board/video/table top games, and will be purchasing a shit ton 
    |f pop and pizza.  And beer.  //  //Yay! 


    |As a fellow Dance Marathoner, thanks Reddit for doing awesome things for CMNH. The kids really appreciate philanthropies li
    |e these and the community support is incredible. Sign up for ExtraLife FTK! (for the kids)


        |This is related to Dance Marathon?  I did DM at Rutgers for 4 years and never heard about this.


            |Yes indeed! It is over seen by the youth marketing team for CMNH, the same division that oversees DM. Both of their
            |goals is to maximize fundraising efforts for CMNH. 


                |CMNH?  Not familiar.  I guess different DM's have different fundraising targets.  Ours goes to a different loca
                | children's hospital.


    |I was so psyched to give this a go for the first time this year with some friends, only to find out it no longer operates i
    | the UK :(


        |Didn't it say it's open ["to EVERY country on planet Earth"](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&am
        |;id=1005&amp;eventID=512)?


    |I really like the shift towards charity that gaming has been taking in recent years. I'm always excited to watch things lik
    | this or AGDQ


    |I just want to say I wish I could come and do a race but I myself have to get medical attention because I have cancer. I ho
    |e the race goes well though guys.


    |I'll be pulling twenty-five straight hours of World of Warcraft. Which hey, I'm sure some people have done before. I can't 
    |ait. Thanks for everyone who helped organize this, and to all those who donate.////[My ExtraLife page](http://www.extra-lif

    |Contact me if there's ever a Monopoly marathon.


        |The units of time it takes to play Monopoly are measured in marathons.


            |The duration of eras in human history is measured in Monopoly games.


            |[deleted]


                |Why even bother commenting?


        |Pretty sure you can play any type of game you want. 


        |check out the Extra+Life page, Monopoly is 100% ALLOWED. //////Join up and have some fun, help these kids out!!!


        |Is there any other type of Monopoly session?


    |I work at A CMN hospital in Montana thank you thank you guys.  The kids you are helping seriously need it. Thank you 


    |I will be doing my marathon stream this Saturday the 12th since I won't be able to do it on November 2nd. You can see my st
    |eam here: http://www.twitch.tv/seephor/  and you can view my fundraising page here: http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fus
    |action=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=49499 ////I have taken a bunch of game requests so it will definitely be a 
    |iverse gaming marathon! 


    |Is there a schedule of games that will be played? Is there any in-marathon benefit for donations (like SDA)? Maybe gold-wor
    |hy?


    |SivHD, Save the children!


    |Any progress on accepting bitcoin donations for this?


    |Apparently I can't join a team after I've already made my fundraising campaign for the year. :(////Last year I cracked the 
    |op 300 on the site with $1k raised and this year I'll be doing a 32 hour marathon to see if I can raise $1,500 for my local
    |children's hospital!////ExtraLife is an amazing cause and a blast to do every year!


    |I'm really interested in doing this. But how would I go about it? Do I have to stream it on twitch and tell people to donat
    | to [insert hospital here] or do I join in on someone else playing and it goes through with that? For instance, if I tried 
    |o raise money by streamin I'm relatively a no one and I would probably have like no one watching. Is there anything that wi
    |l bump up views?////Also, are there only certain games that are in this marathon? ////I'm totally in the dark here sorry if
    |these are some stupid questions.


        |You don't have to stream on twitch, but you can if you wish. Most of the money raised in the even comes from the friend
        | and family of the people who are participating.////If you'd like to stream on twitch you can also raise money there of
        |course. Obviously getting viewers can be a bit of a challenge. You can look around /r/ExtraLife for fellow streamers an
        | ask for tips.////You can play whatever game you like, on whatever platform you'd like. Even boardgames.


            |This will be the first time I can participate and will be streaming it on Twitch, but moreover I would recommend th
            | players at the Reddit offices also livestream their event on Twitch!  I'd like to get in contact with both parties
            |to make it happen.  I think something like this needs to be featured on both sites.  I'm talking with Jared Rea now
            | and I'd like to see Reddit's Extra Life stream featured.


        |- You don't have to stream it. Sure, it's a good way to get more interest and hopefully donations, but it's purely opti
        |nal.//- There are teams, so joining a team is totally an option as well. If you and your team are playing something mul
        |iplayer and someone else is streaming you can point people to their stream.//- You can play any game you want. As far a
        | I know it doesn't even have to be a video game. Play D&amp;D with your friends if you prefer!////I'm on a 2-man team w
        |th my friend and I'm going to stream it, but it will be the first thing I've ever streamed, so it won't necessarily hel
        | much with donations. I figured it would be nice for donators or my other friends to be able to tune in and see us play
        |ng.////My friend and I live across the country from each other and whenever we do hang out in person we take turns play
        |ng single-player campaigns, so we'll be trying to find some games with good co-op campaigns to play. I think we're goin
        | to play Saints Row IV and/or Borderlands 2.////We named our team after one of the best companions and friends in gamin
        | history, [Team Garrus Vakarian](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&amp;teamID=11852). If a
        |yone wants to donate or join the team that's fantastic! It's all for the kids!


    |i'm a pc gamer. can I still do this?//


        |Absolutely! Any gamer can participate. I'll mostly be playing on PC.////If you'd like to join and you use steam, be sur
        | to check out the [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ExtraLife-reddit/).


            |awesommeeeee


        |Why wouldn't you be able to?


    |Those of you in Los Angeles interested in gaming with us take a look at our [thread](http://redd.it/1kritc) about the event


    |You mean to tell me I could be raising money for charity by doing what I normally spend my time doing? Hot dang!


        |~~Many~~ some people enjoy running (like as in the exercisesport) and sometimes there are fun runs.////This is a fun ru
        | but entirely gaming and without exercisesports.


            |The laziest kind of fundraising.


    |My friends and I are doing a 25-hour Dungeon &amp; Dragons "Tomb of Horrors" marathon!////http://www.extra-life.org/team/11
    |87//


    |I love this event and participate every year. Others should give it a try!!


    |**The Salty Blizzards** will be joining this as well! //We're a *slightly* better than garbage League of Legends team that 
    |ill be streaming through Twitch TV @ http://www.twitch.tv/saltyblizzards.//We'll be playing; League; Outlast; Damned; Surge

    |Hey people! I want to piggyback on here to try to get some attention for the Philadelphia group i'm working on organizing! 
    |'ve got a venue and would love for people to come participate. Shoot me a PM if you're interested at all!


    |http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=58296////I'll be playing 24 hours o
    | Paradox Dev Studio games for Penn State Children's Hospital of Hershey, and streaming my journey. Crusader Kings 2, Europa
    |Universalis IV, and Victoria 2! Come take a look if you're interested in history, or grand strategy :) Maybe even some Payd
    |y 2 multiplayer sessions with friends to blow off some steam.////Streaming at www.twitch.tv/nonpr0phet at 8AM EST sharp on 
    |ovember 2nd, and going the distance to 9AM on the 3rd.


    |I'm sorry if this is an inappropriate place for this post - but if anyone in the NJ area is looking for a place to play boa
    |d games for the event.  I've helped put together an event location at [Wild Pig Comics](http://www.wildpigcomics.com) in Ke
    |ilworth, NJ.  We'll be open from Saturday to Sunday playing &amp; streaming board games the whole time.


    |Is anyone taking part of this in Seattle, WA?


    |We did it, reddit!


    |I have an excuse to sit on my butt and play games all day long...//////I'M IN.


    |I wanted to do this last year, and I'd still love to try it this year, but holy fuck how do any of you put aside twenty-fiv
    | solid hours of leisure? Heck, it's likely even more time than that, since you'll have to recover from staying up and being
    |"active" for that long.


        |You are welcome to break your 25 hours up, if you'd like :) While many folks I know will aim for the whole marathon, th
        |re are plenty who will split it across two days or more.


            |Well, that's no fun! That's just a few days of heavy gaming, or many days of normal gaming! That's like running a c
            |arity marathon over the course of a week!


    |Can we still sign up to be part of the team? 


    |I don't have any social media accounts aside from this one. So. http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.p
    |rticipant&amp;participantID=58601


    |I thought this was a real marathon, got excited.  Oh, video games...


    |Wow, I remember Extra Life being a little tiny charity movement on Sarcastic Gamer in 2008 before they shut down - fast for
    |ard five years and now it's on the front page of frickin' reddit. Absolutely beautiful.


    |Sorry to criticise, but this is a waste for anyone living outside of the US/Canada. If you live in one of the other 200+ co
    |ntries on Earth, you'd just be giving money to make up for the failings of the healthcare system of the world's largest eco
    |omy and their biggest trading partner.////Good luck with your localised fundraising event, but remember that the internet i
    |n't local, and non-US fundraisers should receive attention too.


    |Is there any way to search for player by hospital/charity??


    |Cool story


    | #Cash4Kids2013


    |I actually just went to my local game store and got invited for this in Pikeville, Kentucky, I will definitely be participa
    |ing.


    |I've currently raised $280 out of my goal of $500 for Team Reddit! I'll most likely be playing Hearthstone most of the time
    | but I'll be streaming also. One of the things I did to get the word out to my family and friends is making business cards 
    |ith my donation page and stream info. If anyone needs help getting the word out or plans to play Hearthstone as well, pleas
    | let me know! I'd love to play with fellow Redditors!


    |Awesome, a gaming charity fund raiser that actually helps people. Can't stream or spare much cash, but I'll definitely tell
    |everyone I know who can.


    |So you're saying now would be a bad time to start my own stream.


    |Has a shitton of games//////Has more caffeinated soda then anybody should consume in a lifetime//////Has the ability to sta
    | up.//////No clue how to livestream.


    |Baltimore chiming in. Feel free to PM me if you want to team up or anything like that. First year doing this, super excited


    |Is there another way to see a list of hospitals without going one at a time?


    |We're a small group of gamers from Townsville, QLD in Australia (and a couple of guys in Brisbane) called [Team Dysania.](h
    |tp://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&amp;teamID=12322) We'll be streaming our entire 25 hours on [t
    |itch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/teamdysania) and taking donations for game suggestions and also inappropriate requests.////We
    |ll be raffling steam codes and keys as well as giving away some prizes. If there's anyone from the area or surrounds, we'd 
    |ppreciate your support!////[My fundraising page](http://www.extra-life.org/participant/RockLegend1203)


    |What does it actually involve? I mean what games do you play? I would love to raise money, but I don't know what I'm gettin
    | myself into


    |I'm headed home from the Children's Miracle Network Celebration and I just wanted to let anyone who is on the fence about d
    |ing this event know... You are donating your money and time to an absolutely amazing organization. I got to meet over 50 Ch
    |mpion children and their families and they are in so much need for this money. Your donations will help them all be able to
    |see another precious day. Please donate to your local children's hospital, they are literally performing miracles.


    |So buy a 30 dollar t-shirt and 5 bux goes to charity. ////Congrats you've almost saved the world.


        |You're gonna play the games, and you're gonna by the shirt, and we're all gonna feel the energy, and poverty is just go
        |ng to *end.*


    |so you play for 25 hours straight with no sleep?  I read the question about playing / gaming at your own pace etc - but is 
    |here any "check-in" to ensure people are actually gaming? does it really matter? ////the money is raised either way, right?


        |Many folks will be striving to go the whole 25 hours, but it is perfectly fine to break it up. There is no check-in req
        |irement. The ExtraLife event operates around the honour system.


        |Right :)


    |25 hours of gaming AKA, every Friday - Saturday evening.  =)


    |25 Hours of League of Legends while raising money for Charity? Now I have a legitimate reason to blast everyone about LoL.


    |Putting "extra life" on a "team reddit" shirt.////The sweetest of ironies.


    |/r/bacongamejam should be serving up some crunchy, delicious games the week before!


    |Half life 3 confirmed!!! WHOOP!////wait... did I read that wrong?


    |It's a shame that stupid laws prevent me being able to donate to a charity in my country, but I'll be giving it a go this y
    |ar anyway.


    |Can someone explain to me why it's necessary to play games to raise money for a cause than to simply donate money directly 
    |o that cause?


    |THIS IS WHAT WE PLAY FOR! BLARGHGHHGHGH
