How did Coulson survive? (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D(/r//r/television - A premium-quality television subreddit)




    |Most likely explanation is that he's an LMD, he actually died and the current Coulson is simply a highly advanced robotic r
    |plica. 


        |I think for the show it will be the other way round.   Coulson that died was a LMD, and this Coulson is the real one.//
        |/If we find out at the end of Season 1 that this guy is a robot, there is no danger that he will die or be injured in S
        | and onwards.


            |If it was the other way round then why when talking about coulsen's survival,  Shepard Book (Ron Glass) and Maria H
            |ll (Cobie Smulders) say////"He really doesn't know?"////"He can never know"////If he was the original Coulsen it wo
            |ldn't matter if he knew they made a LMD of him surely?


                |But if he is an LMD it doesnt matter either.   Just erase the memory when he finds out he is an LMD.


                    |I'm not saying I buy the "him being a LMD" theory but if he was it would make far more sense that he isn't 
                    |he original as they wouldn't need to keep him being normal a secret from him at all.////Him finding out he 
                    |sn't really human any more would cause problems, especially if they cant just wipe his memory (which I don'
                    | think they have ever said they can), or if he finds out while not around anyone who can wipe it or not aro
                    |nd anyone who knows what shield is etc.////If he isn't a LMD he certainly isn't the same coulsen from the f
                    |lms, he's either a clone, a Scrull an android or has been modified in some major way because "he can never 
                    |now" 


                        |to add to that, every time anyone mentions his recovery in tahiti, he says that it was a "magical place
                        |"  i kind of take that as a cue to anyone asking about it to stop talking about it before the conversat
                        |on can go too far.  as well, it seems a pretty good way to end the conversation for anyone with no know
                        |edge of his past.


                        |On top of all those theories I'm going to have a hard time seeing an LMD actually work in live action f
                        |rmat. I know realism is thrown out the window in a Marvel show but you still have to have some limitati
                        |ns to make it all feel believable. A robot that looks so human that everyone is fooled just feels too u
                        |believable in the Marvel show we have now. If it were some sort of Asgard magic thing I'd believe it, b
                        |t not the humans with their technology. If nothing else it would totally neuter Stark as the penultimat
                        | genius super-inventor.// 


                            |In the comics, there have been LMDs that thought they were real (and consequently had huge problems
                            |when confronted with their real-life counterparts). In some cases, this was intentional (Nick Fury 
                            |upposedly uncorks LMDs left and right to draw off opposition). ////The point of an LMD is that they
                            |are indistinguishable from the real thing and thus effective as a decoy. ////In the Marvel Universe
                            | Stark is in competition with several others for being the super-inventor, so SHIELD has lots of re
                            |ources they can call on. All it requires is a tweak to someone's origin/alignment and job done. Off
                            |the top of my head: Mr. Fantastic, Ant-Man, The Toymaker, The Thinker ...


            |There will be the drama of trying to determine if he's alive or not. Plus there's the issue of LMDs being so close 
            |o the real thing that they may add well be it. 


                |I guess, if we find out, or part of the team does, but he doesnt.


                |He could be a malfunctioning LMD, sort of like [spoiler](#s the super advanced doom-bot at  the end of Book of 
                |oom that thought it was Victor Von Doom,)  Maybe Coulsen was controlling the LMD from the shield hellicarrier, 
                |nd it held some sort of "Mental Implant" for all the use.////He could also be a replicant I guess...


                    |There's precedent for an LMD that thinks it's the person and isn't being controlled, it fits perfectly with
                    |the way that MCU is being done. Plus the Vision idea doesn't work, he's already been cast (I think).


            |I think any sort of "robotic" explanation will ruin the character of Coulson from the movie or from the show.  The 
            |ailed super soldier serum theory I think might just be the best.... failed as in he's balding...


                |I think an Asgardian magic answer would be best.


                    |"It was a magical place."   


                        |"Tahiti" = Asgard?  I could see that.


                            |Maybe he was in Bruges. 


                            |I don't think it is, because didn't they say that the Avengers aren't "Level 7" so that they don't 
                            |now he's actually alive?


                                |Valid point.  But maybe that's all just a ruse to keep him from knowing he really did die?


            |He's a Doombot! 


            |This sounds like a case of stolen identity, like in Arnold Schwarzeneggar's hit movie, [Stolen Identity 3](http://w
            |w.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqd75O7mRBE)!


            |Besides the other very good reasons other people have mentioned, the most important reason the Coulson that died in
            |the Avengers had to be the real Coulson is because otherwise it would undermine the entire Avengers movie.


                |Dont we already know that Fury embellished the death in the film.   The blood splattered cards being a fake.   
                |e says in the film they needed someone to Avenge.////Its not like if they find out he is alive they will sudden
                |y regret saving NY.////Plus surely they will be annoyed to find out a dead friend is being masqueraded as alive
                |anyway.////


                    |&gt;He says in the film they needed someone to Avenge.////Because otherwise, how can we call it  "The Aveng
                    |rs"?


            |Haven't seen the series yet,  but,  I read that the series is a prequel to the movies? 


                |No.  The series definitely takes place after the Avengers movie as the invasion of NY is often mentioned, as is
                |the discovery of Mjolnir in NM.


            |That would be silly.  Why would they replace a perfectly healthy and capable agent with an LMD?  It wasn't like he 
            |as even a particularly important agent.  Preemptively replacing Fury with an LMD?  Sure.  But not Coulson.////Besid
            |s, if it were a copy of him that died, there be no reason to hide the truth from him.


            |Robots can get killed.


                |Everyone can be killed


                |But then replaced, instantly.


                    |It sort of depends on the rules they build around the robots. For all we know it could be his actual brain 
                    |nside of a robot body or somesuch.


                        |Then becomes vision.


                            |That does seem to be a popular theory. I'm actually gunning for JARVIS to become Vision, though.


                                |The deleted scene from the avengers where Loki takes over Jarvis to mess with Tony suggests Jar
                                |is will be ultron.


                                    |That was a big theory, too, but if so, why would they cast a new actor, instead of continui
                                    |g to use Paul Bettany? I think that either JARVIS will somehow be involved in the creation 
                                    |f Ultron, therefore feeling the need to aid in stopping him, and taking on a physical body 
                                    |o he can do so, thus becoming Vision.


                                        |Not a bad theory.   I wouldnt mind Bettany playing an actual role.


        |Where is everyone getting this "LMD" acronym from. Everyone keeps repeating it as though its in common usage, but I've 
        |ever seen it till this thread.


            |Life model decoy, it's common Marvel terminology. They're basically robots that can perfectly copy somebody. They'v
            | been used in many ways and with many methods of control (sometimes controlled by somebody elsewhere, sometimes sel
            |-controlled and aware, sometimes totally unaware), basically it's a tool used to explain certain things and to crea
            |e cliffhangers (Fury has sent in LMDs of himself to discuss things and they've been destroyed).


                |Ah, so sort of a good easy excuse to resurrect dead characters. As a big Marvel reader in the late 80s and earl
                | 90s I'm surprised I haven't heard of it before, but then, I didn't read a lot of SHIELD or Avengers comics. Di
                |n't realize there were so many comic book readers in this subreddit either.


                    |There are comic fans everywhere.


            |Life model decay...i think 


                |*decoy, but yeah


            |It's from the comics. 


        |I've always preferred the theory that, while he was greatly injured, he never actually died. Nick Fury just told the he
        |oes that he died in order to get them to put their egos aside and start working together. In the source material, Fury 
        |ill do whatever it takes to get the job done, even if he has to lie, or emotionally manipulate people to do it, because
        |he considers it to be "for the greater good".////Then again, that could be wrong. We'll have to see the official explan
        |tion.


            |There's definitely something suspicious going on though. "you almost died, but you didn't, then you went to Tahiti 
            |o recuperate" is the story as given and it's clearly a lie.////There's something about it that Coulson himself is u
            |aware of and it's considered vitally important that he never find out. It is almost certain that the Coulson in Age
            |ts of SHIELD is not the same body as the one who died in the avenger's movie.


            |Agreed but at the moment, mostly due to the opening sequence, it's probable that he died and stayed dead. I see no 
            |eason he couldn't be told that the Asgardians saved him and I see even less reason why they would, even as payment 
            |or the tesseract and Loki.


        |In Robert Downey's first scene of Avengers, Coulson calls him on his way up the elevator and RDJr answers: "you've reac
        |ed the Life Model Decoy of Tony Stark" foreshadowing the tech existing. Coulson in the Avengers was an LMD -- Real Coul
        |on probably being on ice or suspended animation, then awoken in "Tahiti" just in time for Sweeps Week!


            |It wouldn't really work with how the universe is set up, the real Coulson must be dead or it cheapens everything (a
            |d the Whedons typically go for total annihilation of a world over cheapening it). Plus it makes more sense for Coul
            |on to be dead due to the whole "he can never know" thing.


        |I think it's more likely that it's a clone rather than an android.


            |I'm thinking more cylon.


            |LMDs have been used in exactly that fashion for some stories (Marvel likes to resurrect characters and some methods
            |get stale).


        |Oooo, I know! What if he's an LMD, and he turns bad. Like he's Ultron in Age of Ultron.////Although that goes against m
        | other theory that Ultron is the robotic arm that Stark built at MIT. He's just sick of being picked on. 


            |I think Ultron will be totally separate but Coulson will get taken over by him.


        |That's the first thing I thought after that "doesn't know" line. But I have enough faith in Whedon to believe that it w
        |ll be something less obvious. LMDs would be the "holodeck" of this show; having the ability to make robots that can pas
        | for human would make it too easy to crank out hack scripts. As [Apophis775 postulates](http://www.reddit.com/r/televis
        |on/comments/1numsu/how_did_coulson_survive_agents_of_shield/ccm7xsn), a great storyline would be Coulson being a "brain
        |in a jar" controlling a robot/cyborg/clone/? body by telemetry. The smug, unflappable, know-it-all personality of Couls
        |n has always been a bit annoying. When he was killed in the movie I thought: "Ah, that's why they wrote him like that, 
        |hey were going to have him die heroically all along!" and the reveal when he discovers the horrible truth of his surviv
        |l will be an even bigger pay-off, if I know my Whedons. 


            |It will be very powerful to see Coulson emotionally dismantled. 


            |This actually still fits with the LMD idea, they are defined so horribly that until the truth has been revealed I d
            |n't think it can be disproved. Plus I'm pretty sure that Whedon has had a hand in some of the best LMD related arcs
            | if anybody can do it right it's him. On a side note Coulson is just supposed to be an annoying but still likable p
            |rson.


                |What LMD arcs did Whedon have a hand in? For that matter, what S.H.I.E.L.D. or Avengers comic has Whedon writte
                |/'had a hand in'? As far as I know, the only comics he's worked on have been Astonishing X-Men and Runaways.


                    |True enough, but the writers tend to at least bounce some ideas off one another. You can't deny that Whedon
                    |could do Coulson as an LMD properly.


    |In the Avengers movie there was a bit of aside dialogue between Tony Stark and Coulson.  Something about Coulson dating a c
    |llist in Portland.   We know that Wanda (the Scarlet Witch) is a cellist and her boyfriend is the android known as the Visi
    |n.  So my guess is that they were setting Coulson up to be come the Vision. 


        |I think the Vision theory makes the most sense given the context of the comics and the films. The clone/LMD theories ar
        | good, but I think they're too obvious and not interesting enough for Whedon.


        |As a comic book nerd, I want this one to be it most of all.


        |this has the highest probability of being true, its boring but i guess that would be great for everyone. no mandarin tw
        |st


    |I think they left out a very plausible option, that he was sent to Asgard to recover. Thats my guess about his reference to
    |Tahiti being "magical". They have actual magic in Asgard, and it's how they saved him, even though he should have died. Plu
    |, it makes sense that asgardian magic could save his life, when one of their own (Loki) is the one who did the damage.


        |&gt;They have actual magic in Asgard////Nope. It's just technology that's too advanced for humans to understand.


            |That still fits, though. To any human ( like Coulson), it might as well be magic.


                |Thing is, they said in the pilot episode that Coulson can never know how he was saved. I feel like if he was sa
                |ed in Asgard, there's no reason why he couldn't know that. That's pretty standard stuff. It's just allies helpi
                |g one another. Coulson already knows that Asgard exists. He's got the clearance for it. He discovered Mjolnir a
                |ter all and was involved in the whole Thor business.////More likely options brought up in this thread are:////1
                | An advanced android indistinguishable from human.//2. Clone.//3. Both/either, with a brain-in-a-jar thing wher
                | Coulson's brain is sitting in a vat somewhere, remotely connected to a replacement body and can never be made 
                |ware of the fact because it would break the connection or w/e?


                    |Because you can't send every agent that falls in battle to be resurrected by magic in Asgard.  Also, it may
                    |fuck with his head to know he died. 


                        |&gt;Because you can't send every agent that falls in battle to be resurrected by magic in Asgard.////No
                        | but then Coulson isn't "every agent". He's Coulson. Given his contribution to the Avengers and how his
                        |death rallied the troops, it's not even remotely far fetched to think that Thor would have extended the
                        |offer to SHIELD that he wants to take Coulson to Asgard and see what *they* can do to help him.////&gt;
                        |lso, it may fuck with his head to know he died.////I think this is a *really* weak argument, given that
                        |our own medical technology can "resurrect" people whose hearts have stopped as long as there's no brain
                        |damage due to lack of oxygen. Does it "fuck with their head" when those people find out they've been re
                        |urrected? Hell no. That's just a ridiculous thing to say.////Coulson was dead, he was resuscitated well
                        |after his death thanks to incredible Asgard technology. What's the big deal in him finding out about th
                        |t? Nothing, that's what.////The "secret" here has to be bigger than that. If it isn't, it'll be a huge 
                        |lop and nobody wants to watch a huge flop.


            |Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.


            |Asgardians can harness magic.////*Enchanted armor called the Destroyer, Hela casts a curse on Odin...


            |That is just one take that maybe appleies to the Asgardians, but magic and the supernatural definitely exist in the
            |Marvel universe--just look at the Celestials or the One Above All. 


                |Yeah, but the Marvel movie universe diverges in many little ways from the Marvel comic universe. Pretty explici
                |ly in the first Thor movie, they established Asgardians in Thor's own words as one based on *very* advanced tec
                |nology rather than one based on magic, specifically making the point that the magic was just the humans' interp
                |etation of what they couldn't explain.////That's why I don't really think that the whole Tahiti/magical place r
                |ference has anything to do with Asgard. Not to mention that if Coulson was really saved by Asgardians, there wo
                |ld be no reason why he couldn't know about it. That's just allies helping each other, and Coulson certainly has
                |the clearance given that he was involved in the events of the first Thor movie in the first place.////I don't m
                |an to say that magic doesn't have a place in the Marvel universe. I just want to point out that magic doesn't h
                |ve a place in Asgard in the Marvel *movie* universe, and therefore the much-quoted reference isn't really that.


        |That would mesh with his "afterlife" comment in the second episode. 


        |I'd bet $20 on this being the answer.  Remember in Thor, how Odin has the bed he sleeps in that heals him,  its probabl
        | something like that. //////And again, he called the place "magical" a dozen times. Its Asgard. 


        |That would explain why he keeps saying Tahiti is a magical place


    |I like the idea of him being Vision, but I think he'll probably turn out to be a clone.


        |It seems that the audience is at least supposed to think he is vision, whether or not he is though is up in the air.//I
        | ep2, while on the plane in his office area, there is a display on the back wall filled with glasses, binoculars, see-i
        |-the-dark goggles and other things related to seeing and vision.  But as mentioned this could be a red herring to make 
        |he reveal bigger.


            |Except it's so obscure it makes no sense as a red herring. ////But as foreshadowing, it's the perfect amount of obs
            |ure... 


            |Do you think he and Elizabeth Olsen (scarlet witch) will have a relationship?


        |Alot of people don't know who the vision is, but that way would be at least more creative than a clone I guess 


    |It's a clone or a robot or something, they hinted at it when they said "He really doesn't know?" "He must never know" or so
    |ething along those lines.////Alternatively they altered the original somehow, but don't want him to know.////I'm glad he's 
    |n the show, though, he was my favorite S.H.I.E.L.D. member, and probably one of my favorite Avengers characters.


        |Yeah, I am leaning towards a clone as well. 


    |I feel like he was resurrected in Asgard hence the reference to Tahiti as a magical place. ////Edit: The only other thing I
    |think it could be is one of those Life Model Decoys from the comic books. I'm still leaning towards my Asgard theory though


        |could be another kind of magic, like Doctor Strange stuff.


            |they do have him in sights for phase 3 or 4


        |just saw your comment after I commented, exactly my thoughts! I think Asgardian magic. 


        |only way the Asgard theory is possible is if shield was able to get him to Asgard without anyone knowing(including Thor
        |since he only has level 6 clearance and everybody who know's Coulson is alive is on 7), figured out how Asgard's techno
        |ogy worked, and figured out how to get back.


            |Unless that was just an offhand lie. Which is more likely than not.  Just because a character says something, doesn
            |t make it true. 


    |I vote for clone. That chestnut never gets dusty.


    |Not sure anyone has mentioned it but what about Thor's healing bed/thing that his father uses when he is ill? Maybe that is
    |"tahiti" or where ever he says he was.


        |If they simply healed him, why couldn't he know about it?  There has to be something weird about who/what he is now.


            |Because you can't just send every agent that dies in the field to Asgard for resurrection.  IMO, its because he was
            |'t just saved, he full on died, and knowing that would fuck with him. 


    |My personal theory is that this is how we're introduced to the Marvel Movie Universe's Doctor Strange. This is definitely a
    |crackpot theory, based solely on the use of the phrase "Tahiti is a *magical* place", but I think Strange could have the po
    |er to bring Coulson back. There have been rumors of a Dr. Strange movie for a long time, but he's kind of a second (or thir
    |) tier Marvel character. What better way to introduce him to the non-comic-savvy crowd than making him central to the myste
    |y of Coulson's return?


    |Considering the actress playing Scarlet Witch, it would be pretty weird if Coulson was Vision. That age gap an all...


    |I'm hoping someone will get an official answer at NY Comic Con next week


        |Marvel is so ridiculously tight-lipped about EVERYTHING. There's no way.


            |So I guess [this](http://i.imgur.com/iRXZ3qY.jpg) is out of the question?  Yes I know it's DC :P


    |Maybe Rose poured the time vortex into his head?


    |My theory is they wanted to make a TV show and Coulson was the cheapest actor they could hire from the movie and they knew 
    |hey could make up some bullshit about his death later on.


        |still great that i can see samuel L jackson as fury and robin scherbatsky sometimes. :( better than nothing


            |I bet she becomes a regular or recurring if the show gets season 2, though.


                |Considering HIMYM is almost over, I agree. 


        |Next you're going to go and say the sonic screwdriver is just a cheap device to move the plot along because the writers
        |really aren't very good at what they do and can't be bothered to come up with more clever solutions that might involve 
        |ctual known science


        |Ding ding ding, we have a winner.


        |Ac... tor...?


    |He survived by getting a high number of page views caused by an article without the fan theories qualifier in the title. 


    |I assumed he was a clone. Some kind of robot works too, I guess, but that seems complicated. The writers probably don't eve
    | know yet.


    |Cause they didn't want him to? The show would have no connection to the Avengers movie/Marvel unvierse if he wasn't there(e
    |cept for the name).


    |Whatever it is exactly (probably an LMD), he knows or at least strongly suspects that he's dead. In Ep. 2, when he's being 
    |ccused of having a midlife crisis, he slips in the little aside, "It's more of an afterlife crisis, really..."


        |He knows that he was technically dead for at least a little while, that's part of the official story.  Maybe he suspect
        | that there's more, or maybe he doesn't.


    |Why can't he be like an Ultron and Hank Pym made him. //Opening the door for the Antman movie!


    |Hes a character in a comic world. They don't exactly have problems coming back from the dead. 


    |Can you move the letters of tahiti around and make anything that makes sense?  .... That ii THAT II!  yEah..... no


    |I havent seen the show yet, but i just assumed that it took place before his death. 


    |Soooo, a little off topic, but how is this show? It premiered recently and I haven't heard ANY buzz about it, despite the m
    |vie being huge. Is it really good and just no one is watching it or is it kind of crap?


        |At this point, it's not that great. It feels like a procedural, complete with the bonehead macho agent, the quirky hack
        |r, two British scientists. Colson is really the only reason to watch. The writing is cheesy, the timing is off, and mos
        | of the characters are annoying. The show has potential and I believe Joss could turn it around (see Dollhouse), but it
        |is no Avengers.


    |He was brought back to life by the power of commercialism.


    |I think the references to Tahiti being a magical place alludes to Dr Strange. We know Dr strange can bring back the dead. M
    |kes sense they want a way to introduce him to a larger audience this would be the vehicle to do it. 


        |Hey! That's my idea.... (and I already posted it)////(and I know you got it off my fb, Phage :P)


            |I was indeed posting your idea, I couldn't find it on here with the search function on my phone. 


    |It's simple:  This Coulson is a Life Model Decoy BUT The real Couson also survived, and is probably wounded in a coma somew
    |ere.////This will lead to a plot at the end of season 2 or 3 where they find the real Coulson, along with some MacGuffin to
    |fix him, and to end any confusion or awkwardness for the show going forward the LMD Coulson will wind up having to sacrific
    | himself to save the real one with some affirming notion about how human he was despite being a robot.////Then the next sea
    |on will revolve around the real Coulson trying to acclimate to the team, the changing world circumstances he missed, the ba
    |tle of New York etc., and sort of being the odd man out in place of the ever reliable leader the LMD Coulson was.////At lea
    |t that's my theory, but I don't see them just saying hey this isn't the real Coulson and lets have a robot in his place for
    |the duration of the show.


    |They hinted he was a life model decoy that is programmed to think he is the real Agent Coulson. Obvious really, no speculat
    |on necessary.  


    |I didn't really enjoy the show. too campy.//////anyone else just not digging it?////


    |at first I thought he is a clone - although everytime he references "Tahiti" where he went to recover he ALWAYS refers to i
    | as "a magical place"//so there might be something to the Scarlett Witch angle...//in the pilot Agent Hill said "he must ne
    |er find out"...referring to whatever brought him back


    |I was thinking it took place in the past... Though I have no interest in the show nor do I know if it has started.. I so I 
    |ould be totally wrong


    |Please don't let it be the worst possible choice ever... A CLONE.... :/ Joss and his staff are better than that. But i can 
    |ay if they pull that crap... big ole chunk of faith lost. its gonna be something bad-ass... i know it!  When i say bad ass 
    | mean bad assery that still keeps him closer to his human counterparts but has the potential to become BADASS! :)//EDIT: cl
    |irifcation


    |Um.. spoiler much?


        |The show has aired two episodes already, spoilers expire in less than a night these days.  Deal with it. ////////Breaki
        |g bad, GoT, all big shows are openly discussed on TV and Newspapers the very next day. ////Spoilers are gone. 


    |There's a theory he took some of Captain Americas serum.


        |RTFA, that was in the op. 


    |As someone who only saw the poster for this show when it first came out, I immediately assumed that it was a prequel to the
    |Avenger movie.


        |They mention The Battle for New York, 5 minutes into the show, try watching it. 


    |He's a brainwashed Skrull agent. That's the only thing that makes sense and it sets up another Avengers or Fantastic Four m
    |vie with a Skrull invasion.


        |It wont be used to set up a new FF movie as Fox owns the rights and are already starting a reboot.////tbh I'm not even 
        |ure if marvel CAN use scrulls for their movies as they tend to be associated with FF (for instance one of their main vi
        |lains is the "super skrull").////it could be like quicksilver/scarlet witch where both can use them but I haven't heard
        |anything like that tbh 


    |Jane dies in Thor 2.  Thor brings her to asguard to be resurrected, and mentions "just as you did for my friend Agent Couls
    |n".////////


        |Can you see into the future, or merely have a copy of the script?


            |Stock up on bottled water and non-perishable good before December 18th.


    |In the second episode he said it was like "getting shot,"  People can recover.  He probably was just hospitalized for a whi
    |e until he could get back to work. 


        |Have you ever read a comic book in your entire life?


        |yeah it also says he got impaled through the heart. you dont recover from getting impaled through the heart with a norm
        |l weapon, let alone an enchanted alien weapon.


    |I thought in the first episode, they said he never actually died. 


        |He said he died for 40 seconds and Agent Hill corrected him saying it was only 8 seconds.  Coulson responded with it se
        |ms longer every time.  May be hinting at what they did to his memory is becoming less effective over time.


            |i thought she said that every time he told the story, it got longer, being a joke about him being melodramatic.


        |That's how he tells it, but there's still something "he can never know" about his injuries and/or recovery.


    |Infinity Formula?


    |thats the confusing thing.  it's a show about superheroes.  oh yeah a guy can jump off a skyscraper and live, no problem th
    |re.  "hey how did that guy survive that stab from Loki!"  some things you just have to let go.  


    |I think people are over complicating things. He survived. No LMDs, clones, or any other of that BS. There was enough ambigu
    |ty there for them to get away with it. It doesn't need some complicated comic book style retcon.


        |This would be fine, except for the "he can never know" thing. This clearly indicates that there's something more compli
        |ated about his death. Also "he faked your death to motivate the troops," if it is the real reason, is the worst reason 
        |or faking a death in the history of everything. 


        |Joss Whedon would be a very shitty writer if it was just "he survived." No, the whole "He doesn't know" and "He must ne
        |er know" plus the Tahiti thing are setting things up for a big reveal. Until 1 minute ago I had no idea who The Vision 
        |as, but the fact the casting for the Scarlet Witch leaked courtesy of Sam Jackson along with the fact that Whedon is an
        |OG comic book nerd points to this being the case.////Or simply view this (Coulson's mysterious return) as Chekhov's gun
        | you don't show a pistol on the wall in one act if you aren't going to have it go off in the next...


        |Thank you.  People are reading too much into this.  If Nick Fury is willing to fake the blood on the cards he can fake 
        |oulson's death.


            |But then why do they say he can never find out what happened?


                |clearly it's just that he must never find out that where he went wasn't Tahiti, it was a lower budget resort ne
                |r Hawaii.////But seriously, the point about the cards was that Fury is enough of a stone cold bastard that he l
                |st one of his closest friends and thought "I can use this to emotionally manipulate the team... but first i nee
                | to make it have MORE impact". Coulson died, this Coulson is so similar that even HE thinks he's Coulson, but h
                |'s not.


                    |And if Coulson didn't actually die, he was enough of a stone cold bastard to ruin Coulson's prized card col
                    |ection. Must be why he gave Coulson or "Coulson" that car and bus.


    |Its he was injected with the serum, it makes the most sense.////The Avengers needed something to avenge, so he faked his ow
    | death. ////He's the same Phil from the first cap movie.


        |Keep thinking that, it's going to make the twist that much better at the end of the season.


    |They said in the first episode that he never actually died.  He faked his death to motivate his team


        |yes, except that it's made pretty clear that that is not the truth


    |Nice spoiler for thosewho havent got round to watching


        |I don't think you can call it a spoiler when he's in every advertisement for the show ////Even the official hashtag for
        |the show way before it aired was #coulsenlives


        |You do realize that every poster, billboard and commercial that was out there before the premiere featured Clark Gregg 
        |ront and center, right? I'm a pretty big anti-spoiler zealot, but it's pretty clear knowing that Coulson was going to b
        | in S.H.I.E.L.D and the mystery of how he survived was a going to be a hook for the show. 


        |Spoilers expire in a day now, get over it.
