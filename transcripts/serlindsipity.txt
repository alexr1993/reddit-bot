I made an art series depicting Andy Warhol's soup cans without the can and just the soup. Edible, free standing, not appetizing at all.(/r/pics)




    |Was it frozen or was a thicking agent added to stabilize it? But is still pretty cool

    |Very cool. Should the light be optimized in the background though?


        |Completely agree. This was done when I was in college and access to proper lighting and studio equipment was out of the

            |Just more confirmation that I don't get art. A kickstarter for expanding a derivative piece. Huh.


                |I wouldn't call it derivative, but rather referential. A lot of fine art is about making fun of itself, or at t
                |e very least making commentary on itself.


                    |Even so, referential work usually isn't worth more than a smirk in my opinion. Like "Oh, I get it", and the

            |ide down?


                |Don't forget the gelatin!


            |I'd put it higher that you're raising money to expand this out. If the hive mind likes it, we can get you funded pr
            |tty quickly.


            |&gt;  Just recently launched a Kickstarter to do it////This is laughable. I swear, everyone is starting a kickstart
            |r these days.  You don't need 1500 to light a can of soup.


        |&gt; Should the light be optimized in the background though?////As someone who has no idea in lighting or photo shoots,
        |can someone explain this to me?


    |Neat, I like it.. ////Is it meant to rely on the un-appetizing part though, because I could totally go for a bowl of minest
    |one or chicken gumbo now..


    |Hey just because it looks unappetizing doesn't mean it's bad :) Corn Beef Hash looks like dog food at first, but when cooke
    | it looks a little bit less like dog food. Good thing it tastes amazing.


    |Clean and effective. I now imagine cutting the soup into slices or cubes, probably with the can and label arranged in piece
    | as if exploded.


    |I can picture myself laying one of those on its side and cutting off a slice, like the canned cranberry sauce on thanksgivi
    |g.////"Mother, pass the chicken noodle log please."


    |If you take any food and freeze/shape it like that they will all look just as unappetizing.


        |Not Ice Cream.


    |Have you considered taking these post photo shoot, putting them in a bowl while they're still solid, and photographing peop
    |e looking at them all sad? Because I would enjoy that. 


    |I had dinner at a steakhouse last year, and one of the things I ordered (because the ingredients sounded awesome together) 
    |as a slaw salad with shrimp. I came in an upside-down metal bucket, which the waiter gently lifted to reveal the "salad mol
    |" (that sounds weird), which evenly collapsed onto the plate when I stuck my fork in. It was delicious, but it looked much 
    |ike this, only more alien-like, before the collapse. Twelve bucks.


    |No tomato? 


    |Try making the background more consisting. Was your lighting different? Exposure times? You could probably even this out in
    |photoshop. 


        |She mentioned in another comment that it was for a school project and that adequate lighting was not available and used
        |what she had.  She agreed when someone else called it out too and said it would be fixed in the final shoot.


    |The least appetizing part is that its congealed into a solid mass.////Its congealed into a solid mass because OP added gela
    |in to make it into a solid mass.////-_-


    |They should sell them like this with a clear thin plastic - truth in advertising


    |Yum frozen soup.


        |Not frozen, its gelatin. They would melt under the lights.


            |Yum, jello soup.


                |A traditional Russian dish, curiously.


                    |Ah yes, is very good. 


    |I like this. 


    |To be fair.  These are all concentrated.////The recipe calls for at least one can of water to be added.////I imagine it wou
    |d be more appealing then.


        |I can never get an entire can of water along with the soup to fit in my bowls.////And I like the concentrated broth in 
        |ondensed chicken noodle. It's an MSG flavour explosion in my mouth.


    |Gain more karma and exposure and cross-post it to /r/shittyfoodporn, OP!


    |May I ask what makes this art?


        |I really wish art meant once again the mastery in skill and endless pursuit of its perfection rather than cans, canned 
        |hit and what have you.


    |That's pretty cool! 


    |I don't eat a lot of soup, so is this what it means when it says "condensed" soup on the label?


        |It means to say you should add water.////Like canned milk or juice concentrate, a greater portion of the water has been
        |removed for compact storage.


    |It's like you took a famous symphony and then arranged an electronic drumbeat for it and then you just played that drumbeat
    |by itself and it's barely acceptable to listen to if you're familiar with the symphony. 


    |Says you.


    |FUCKING SOUP


    |Makes me want to pick one up and eat it like that. Grab me a bag of ice cream sticks and make a fortune selling soup on a s
    |ick. 


        |Ice soup! Almost as popular on reddit as ice soap.


    |You should at least have locked the white balance...


    |That's fucking awful, but still infinitely better than Andy Warhol. //


    |Meh, doesn't look that disgusting. Even if you make your own soup it'll coagulate into a goo like that.


    |You have literally deconstructed pop art.


    |"Art".


    |Yup, unsubscribing from /r/pics.


    |"Art"


    |Can someone remind me again why Andy Warhol's soup cans were considered art?


    |It's canned food, its meant to last a long time and still be edible. It's not really meant to be appetizing. Still an inter
    |sting concept though. 


    |"You're so ugly you could be a modern art masterpiece!"


    |OMG SO DEEP! I wish I was this talented!


    |"art"////Right.


    |For some reason, the first thought that popped into my head after I saw this picture was "This must be what Eskimos eat all
    |the time." ////I'm not going to defend this thought, nor am I proud of it, but it happened. I don't know why. I apologize t
    | any Inuit people that may have been offended by this comment and I also ask: Is it weird eating all your food in tube form
    | Do your dogs and cats enjoy their tubular wet food as well?


    |This is brilliant

        |"wit"


            |What's the difference?

            |Like the niggers


        |All art is "art." That's the whole point. It's subjective.


        |I made this 


        |Came here looking for this comment. Have an upvote!


    |Warhol's soup cans were all tomato soup, because tomato soup was what he ate for lunch every day. Also the repeating same i
    |age of the same soup represented his belief in the artist as a machine or factory, mechanically churning out the same thing
    |over and over.////So, why do you say you are depicting Warhol's soup cans? I don't think you understood Warhol's work at al


        |Appropriate username for a Warhol Stan. Good question too though.

        |&gt;Warhol's soup cans were all tomato soup////...are we thinking about different works of art here?  Because the [imag

    |lame.


    |Brillant. :highfive:


    |The bottom far right one looks like maggots...


    |Edible?  So, is it gelatin, agar, arrowroot or alginate?  Or something I'm not familiar with?  ////And did you try to eat a
    |y of them?


    |The noodles look tempting, probably because there is nothing to eat over here except for maybe canned soup.


    |Made me want to ralf. 


    |Someone needs to invent spaghetti gelatin.


    |I really like this, but if it's with pull tops these aren't the original soups.  Aren't there old school condensed cans you
    |can use?


    |This is very cool. I like the idea better than the actual image; I am a big fan of visual images with subtext. 


    |What's the secret?


    |Mmmmmm, noodle soup.


    |Can you explain how this functions as art for those of us who don't understand why this is significant?////Not trolling, I 
    |m genuinely interested. 


    |No food for a week? This looks like the best meal in the world.

    |You should make a soup castle 


    |mmmmm... chicken noodle-sicle.


    |no joke immediately made me hungry for some chicken noodle.. must get soupppp


    |Amazing!


    |...art..? My dogs canned food does the same thing when I open it.


    |Wait so you mean soup in a can that you pay 2 dollars for doesn't look as good as soup that you pay 10 dollars for?


    |This is pretty brilliant actually, great job! 


    |Should have used manual mode on the camera.

    |With a better photographer this would be amazing. Really Really great idea. Get some good pics that make it look as iconic

    |I think the company should do it, man! Reddit moves the needle, surely big C must know what's up. Don't they have an Execut
    |ve of Viral Marketing or something?


    |What does it mean?


    |I really love this. Good job


    |I don't know, I think it looks pretty appetizing.


    |Added gelatine to the soup contents? 


    |Whatdya mean not appetizing?   I'd eat the ass out of any of those right now.  


    |This is a soup kitchen that would even make Dirty Mike and the Boys jealous.


    |Do you have larger versions? Might you be selling these online somewhere? 


    |"Everyone will be famous for 15 minutes." //-Andy Warhol////Reddit in a nutshell

    |Art? I will never understand it.

    |Alphabet, Chicken Noodle, Tomato &amp; Rice, Vegetable?, Beef &amp; Barley, Clam Chowder, Split Pea, and Chicken &amp; Rice


    |This isn't art.


    |Did you freeze the cans? How did you get the soup to retain its shape?


    |Can someone explain this to me in an artistic sense...is it supposed to "mean" or "say" something? Or Is it just the cool-f
    |ctor of seeing canned food without the can?////


        |OP is trying to be hip by mentioning Andy Warhol. Basically, no talent.


        |Well, it's sort of a clever approach to Warhols paintings.  Like, a variation of it.  It is a bit novel (i've never see
        | anyone do it and not something I'd think of doing) and just a riff on the Warhols.


    |This is art! I'll give you $30,000,000 for it.

    |why is the background for each can a different shade? ////they should all be the same.  ////Tip: use manual exposure and a 
    |onstant artificial light source


    |if this is art, you shouldn't really tell us how to feel about it.


        |Yeah, I agree. OP sounds pretentious. Like he's too good for Campbell's soup. Well, some of us aren't corporate fatcats

    |wow you retards really will upvote anything


    |Looks like a new line of marketable candles. There's something to be had here.


    |I may never eat tinned soup again.  Cool project though


    |Looks good to me


    |There's absolutely no way they put that much noodles into their soup.


    |As a soup lover.... This looks amazing 


    |I think you just arted, bro


    |better than Warhol, but thats not saying much..


    |Love it! Hope your kickstarter goes well. I'm going to send this link to my photo friends (art student here) and see what t
