Nine long-lost "Doctor Who" episodes found(/r//r/television - A premium-quality television subreddit)




    |This is ~10% of all lost episodes. Wow.//// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes


        |It gives hope that more are out there


        |I thought that they found them all in Kenya 


            |That was a rumor


            |I read an article that all 106 lost episodes were found perhaps they are going to trickle them out


                |There's almost no way this is possible, especially considering that no country bought all of them, and that the
                |e's one that is 99% gone forever


                    |What's the story on this 99% gone one? Couldn't it be possible that some random person recorded it and its 
                    |n an attic somewhere?


                        |A Christmas Special called The Feast of Steven in the middle of a twelve part Daleks story. Only Austra
                        |ia bought the story and never aired it, but the Feast of Steven was left out. It is presumed that the o
                        |ly copy was junked, but there's a small chance it's in a cardboard box in a basement. That Dalek story 
                        |s also very unlikely to be completed, but amazingly, we've recovered two episodes


                            |Australia did not buy Daleks' Master Plan but were sent viewing copies of it and Mission to the Unk
                            |own. The censor's advice was it was impossible to cut three episodes and Mission down to G rating b
                            |cause of the plot rather than any specific scene of violence, and was thus untransmittable before 7
                            |30pm. The films would have been returned to the UK, but there is no record. Episodes 5 and 10 (Coun
                            |er Plot and Escape Switch) were returned in 1983, episode 2 (Day of Armageddon) in 2004.


                        |The problem is that many of those lost media are "pre personal recording device".////Especially for mag
                        |etic carrier information (which's media where highly expensive at the time) It was rather the norm to r
                        |use the tapes after a certain amount of time.////For instance the Monty pythons flying circus episodes 
                        |here almost lost due to this.////Material on film was often archived, tape wasn't.


                            |Shame there wasn't an illegal way to share tv shows over a worldwide medium back then isn't it?


                            |I feel like my life would be tragically different if no Monty Python series episodes made it into t
                            |e 90's.


                    |No it isnt. All the audio tapes to all the "lost" episodes still exist. I have personally listened to most 
                    |f them while "watching" reconstructed episodes of old who.


                        |Well, I mean in video form it's gone, so it won't ever be 'recovered'


                            |I never understood why they never went "fuck it we can use animation to reconstruct the video" that
                            |seems like the obvious option here.


                                |IIRC the animation is pretty expensive, and for a lot of the totally missing serials on what ev
                                |rything looks like, it would pretty much be a crapshoot. That's why partly missing serials are 
                                |nimated because they have something to go off of.


                                |maybe we'll get lucky and some animators that are huge fans of dr who will go ahead make video 
                                |nimations for the missing video.  even if the visuals aren't all that accurate, i bet the artis
                                |s' rendition of it would be close enough to keep the feel of the show. and it would be awesome

                                |eo"////They have actually done this for several episodes. They recently released an animated ve
                                |sion of "The Tenth Planet" episode 4, in which the Doctor regenerates for the first time.


                        |Where can you listen to them?


                        |If they have the audio, wouldn't the sensible thing be for them to commission animations to go along wi
                        |h them. I'm sure there'd be a market for that.


                            |Yes.////http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes#Animated_episodes


            |They were found in Nigeria. In a town in the center of the country called Jos. ////The local station there, NTA Jos
            | is one of the oldest in Nigeria set up in the late 1960's////Back in the days we bought a shed load of TV programm
            |s from the UK (even very un-PC like "Mind Your Language" and "Love Thy Neighbour" ) plus Jos had a large British po
            |ulation as it is at a high altitude and a lot cooler than the rest of Nigeria so there were a lot of British progra
            |mes on the TV station there.////It may way also explain why the tapes lasted longer as it is a lot less humid and c
            |oler than the rest of Nigeria in Jos.////Nowadays Nollywood movies and local franchises of shows like Nigerian Idol
            | Apprentice Nigeria, Big Brother Africa, The Survivor rule the airwaves.

            |Its almost like you didn't even read why they are missing.


            |That's not how recording television shows at a studio was done in the 60's. if you were using film it was likely st
            |red well; But, tape was bought with the intention of being reused multiple times, so many shows that used tape are 
            |one forever.


    |So was the earlier announcement that all lost episodes were found another hype fest? Or was this from that collection? prob
    |ble unrelated? 


        |The original rumor was that all the lost episodes had been found, but then people started to believe it was just anothe
        | rumor. Then BBC comes forward and says "yes we actually did get some episodes, but only 11, not 109."


            |So 99 left? Do we still have the scripts and critical reviews, maybe we can recreate them.


                |There are audio recordings of all the missing episodes.


                    |Why hasn't anyone animated them :O


                        |Some of them, they have:////http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes#Animated_episodes


                |The guy you are replying to got the numbers slightly wrong. There were 106 lost episodes prior to this find. Th
                |y found 11 episodes, but only 9 were lost episodes. The total number of lost episodes is thus now 97.


                |...with dogs playing all the major roles.


            |I think these are two different cases.  The original rumor was 106 from Ethiopia.  And this is 9 from Nigeria.  And
            |the others were stated to have been found and need to be mastered and were awaiting BBC confirmation.  These have b
            |en mastered and released today (The Web Of Fear is on iTunes now).  I'm guessing it takes longer than a week to mas
            |er and release episodes.


                |BBC seemed to deny the Mirror article, saying the number was lower than 106 but they wouldn't announce until th
                | 50th Anniversary.


        |The rumour is that Philip Morris, the man who rediscovered the 9 re-released episodes, actually found a great many more
        |at the same time. The problem is said to be that he has been negotiating with the BBC for many months and his demands h
        |ve been less than workable, for instance demanding that Steven Moffat step down as showrunner of the current series, an
        | demanding that the restoration techniques to be used on the films are far in excess of what is required for their qual
        |ty. As a result the BBC has only signed the contracts to complete the two recent releases as a test of their commercial
        |viability and public demand, because the process will be such a chore for the remainder. One of the things that seems t
        | validate this is that at the press conference for the re-release it was heavily hinted that there were more to come, a
        |d that if the fandom keeps its nose out of it then they will come more easily, *Philip Morris* has had run-ins with 'Wh
        | superfans like Ian Levine before and when Bleeding Cool leaked this rumour earlier in the year it apparently set back 
        |he process greatly.////*But it is only rumour.*


            |He sounds like a bit of a cunt.


            |I think it's more likely that Philip Morris is a time traveler and has the ability to retrieve these episodes from 
            |he past. If nothing else, it explains the ridiculous, obviously [made-up name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_
            |orris_USA).


                |We'll see The Doctor use the name Philip Morris as a fake name on his "blank" ID card (not sure about the techn
                |cal name), if nothing more than a compromise to the guy from BBC in order to get more lost episodes.


                    |It's called psychic paper. Everyone knows that.


                        |Everyone who? I knew it at one point but forgot it. I've watched all of the modern Doctor Whos up to Se
                        |ies 6. Just haven't gotten around to it yet. So it hasn't be on my mind for 2 years.


                            |It's just psychic paper, ok?


            |I think the Moffat thing is just a rumour. If anything, maybe Morris is asking for tons of money the BBC isn't will
            |ng to spend, and maybe too much things on the "personal gratification" side. But stepping in and demanding that X o
            | Y be removed from the show ? Unbelieveable.


            |&gt;  for instance demanding that Steven Moffat step down as showrunner of the current series,////To be replaced wi
            |h... who? I can think of so many worse people who conceivably could end up in charge.


        |It was speculation. Though BBC has said there may be more episodes coming. 


            |Which is what I'd do if I were the BBC and found a trove of episodes. 'Recover' 9 a year for the next decade, it's 
            |ike having a license to print money. Though considering that one of the serials they released was still missing an 
            |pisode, it probably means they didn't, in fact, recover most or any of the other episodes. Plus the BBC isn't out t
            | make boatloads of cash, unlike the American networks so I don't think the profit motive applies.


        |No that was inaccurate. 9 episodes were found in total. 


    |Wait, so you're saying that there were Doctor Who episodes that were lost in time?


        |Yep. 97 of the 253 episodes from the first six years of the show are still missing. It was BBC policy to destroy old fi
        |m to save space... this happened to all BBC shows from the time, but most of them no one cares about.


            |Or knows they should care about. There's a lot early pre-Monty Python material lost that probably was as brilliant 
            |s the later works, but we'll never know.


            |I don't have time to find the link (I'm at work) but I saw about a week ago that they found 106 episodes in Ethiopi
            |.////Google it.


                |Obviously that was bullshit, they actually found nine in Nigeria.


                    |How much money do we have to wire for them to release them?


                        |I heard a prince has them.


        |don't worry, The Doctor will sort it all out.


    |I heard about this on NPR last night as I was driving home. Didnt stop me from doing a happy dance!


        |Will have to see if I can find that on the NPR website and list, thanks for the tip!


            |You are welcome. :)


    |And exclusively (officially) available on iTunes. Cool, BBC.


        |DVD in november. Believe it or not iTunes was the fastest (monetizable) way for them to deliver you the episodes. Poor 
        |isunderstood BBC. 


            |They could have instead of charging for very old shows, release it to the community and charge for a enhanced versi
            |n on there site.


                |What exactly is an enhanced version?


                    |Like video editing and cleaning it up, or colour.


                        |thats just silly


            |Amazon Prime?


                |They can make more money much more easily putting the episodes out on demand now, then working out a contract w
                |th Amazon for streaming the episodes after it comes out on DVD.


                |Fuck Amazon////What about the BBC iPlayer?


                |Amazon prime is just like Netflix, they wouldn't actually get paid per sale, they'd make next to nothing 


                    |Amazon also rents and sells movies and tv shows. Amazon prime is just an offshoot. I watch movies all the t
                    |me on amazon without a prime membership.


                    |netflix put blockbuster out of business completely, and is about to do the same to redbox.  trust me, strea
                    |ers make a **LOT** more than nothing.//the "on-demand" paradigm is here to stay.  the days of corporations 
                    |nd bureaucrats telling us *when* and *where* to watch something are rapidly coming to an end.


                        |Isn't the whole point of blockbuster and redbox that we get to pick when and where we watch something?/
                        |//For example i rent a video when I want to, then I take it to the place I want to watch it

            |BBC wants to make money. Fuck them right?


                |Sheesh, it's not like they had to pay to obtain/ship the film, restore it, or convert it to a digital format!  
                |s


                |They're the ones that destroyed it in the first place just to save a bit of money.


            |Why should they have made them free? Because you don't want to pay for them? It's a product they made and are distr
            |buting to us with incredible speed.


                |Because that's the point in the BBC. It's paid for in the TV license.


                    |It may be to cover restoration costs/agreement with who found them


                        |And them making money is a good thing for future production budgets and actors' salaries. I love shows 
                        |ike Sherlock and I want them to continue to have quality actors like Freeman and Cumberbatch. Who knows
                        |who they can get with the right salary for future shows. 


                            |But that's probably worse for the viewer because they'll be able to get away with making fewer epis
                            |des. What is Doctor Who now, like six episodes a year? It's insane.////Sherlock has been on the air
                            |since 2010 and they only do three episodes every two years! I realize it's a longer running time, b
                            |t it's not *THAT* long. Doyle wrote 56 Sherlock Holmes stories and 4 novels... at this rate, it'll

                            |eans an awful lot of waiting.


                                |Doctor Who has pretty much always been six episodes long per season, since like 50 years ago wh
                                |n they started. But the new seasons have been as long as 12-14 sometimes.////One of the biggest
                                |things I respect about British television shows is that they don't conform to the idea of stret
                                |hing out a serialized story to fit a specific time block. We have 13 episode seasons or around 
                                |4 episode seasons here, depending on what the station wants. That means the writers walk in the
                                |room knowing how many episodes they need to fill even if they don't need that much time, which 
                                |eads to pointless filler episodes dragging the story down. The BBC just lets them choose what t
                                |ey want- Sherlock has 3 per season, Doctor Who has anywhere from 6-12 a season (sometimes up to
                                |14 I think), and one of my favorites from awhile ago, Wire in the Blood, did 4-5 depending on t
                                |e storyline they wanted to follow.////I'd much rather have less episodes fitting exactly what s
                                |ory the writer intends to tell than have them stretch things out and add needless exposition to
                                |fit a cookie cutter timeline.


                                    |Doctor Who used to do serials of five or six 25 minute episodes that covered a single story
                                    |ine, but they'd do several of these serials a year. There were 7 serials in the 1967-1968 s
                                    |ason (which is the season 'Web of Fear' is from), six of them consisted of six episodes and
                                    |one of four, so that's a total of a thousand minutes of runtime.////Series 6 of the new Doc
                                    |or who had thirteen episodes, three of which were 50 minutes, the rest of which were 45, wh
                                    |ch totals only 600 minutes of runtime... and that's actually a fairly productive year! Ther
                                    | were only two 60 minutes specials in 2009!////But, in any case, it's episodic content. Yes
                                    | there are a few long story arcs, but most of the show is "This week we're on planet x in t
                                    |e year y trying to do z," and it doesn't relate to anything at all they did last week or th
                                    |t they will do next week. There's no cause for concern about stories being stretched out an
                                    | watered down.


                |The BBC was also responsible for [deliberately destroying the originals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Wh
                |_missing_episodes).////I know copyrights go on for thousands of years now and all that, but if there was any ju
                |tice in the world, if you put something on TV fifty years ago and then destroyed it 10 years after that, any re
                |aining copies found in the wild would go into the public domain.


                    |They didn't have the storage medium we do now ,so they had to in order to make room for future works. Now t
                    |at we can store lots and lots and lots and lots of media on a device that can fit in your pocket, that is n
                    | longer necessary, whereas back in those days, storing that much would have taken up a few rooms.


                |I kind of think they should have released them free, because it seems silly that they've kept the copyright on 
                |omething they didn't even have a copy of / access to. It seems counter-intuitive that they managed to own somet
                |ing all this time, yet at the same time, the BBC wasn't even sure if what they own still existed.////I understa
                |d that's not how copyright works, but it still seems screwy to me.

                    |them free////Above: applause, bro.


            |I think anyone actually interested in watching these knows how to torrent.  The old episodes, from what I seen, rea
            |ly just suck and only seem to appeal to the super die hard completionists.  I don't know anyone who's ever wanted t

                |s as well.  I think the atmosphere created in some of the old episodes is really second to none 


                    |Agreed. Some of the earlier episodes have some deep social and philosophical issues reminiscent of Star Tre
                    |- oh wait, that's right, Doctor Who came first.


                        |Plus it can be fun to laugh at the old special effects, like the sleeping bag they used for an alien la
                        |va once.


                |Depends on how you define old, really. I think most if not all of the 1st doctor's episodes wouldn't be very en
                |oyable to the average modern viewer. 2nd doctor, no idea. There's so few of his episodes remaining that it's ha
                |d to say. 3rd's kind of a transitional phase. But I think with the 4th doctor and on there's an increasingly la
                |ge amount of episodes that an average scifi fan who's not a doctor who fan in particular might actually enjoy o

                |&gt; //&gt; //&gt; The original copies were destroyed by BBC. Many early television films from both USA and Bri
                |ain were destroyed as film was expensive to store and often just reused. No one had quite realized the value of
                |keeping copies of the films yet. ////Most assumed that any of the foreign copies were destroyed or gone forever

                        |Not really. You have to remember that at the time Doctor Who was not exactly as popular as it is now.


                            |Television itself wasn't as popular. The sets were expensive, so a far fewer percentage of househol

                            | re-using them was a way of keeping costs down. No-one knew that there would be a market for old ep
                            |sodes, as home video wasn't around.


                                |And they hadn't figured out rerunning them at some point was a viable option due to contracts e

                            |I don't think anyone ever expected the show to blow up as it has either.  it wasn't very successful
                            |during it's original run, if I remember correctly.  At the time, I imagine it'd be like the execs t

                                |I don't think it's fair to compare Doctor Who to the Big Bang Theory on any level.////Doctor Wh
                                | was actually always pretty popular in Britain. When they introduced some people from the Radio

                                |ind the "Doctor Who song". It's a cultural phenomenon.////A fairer comparison would be Star Tre
                                |, which was cancelled by NBC because they thought the low ratings meant it wasn't profitable, w
                                |en in fact it was their poor understanding of demographics and the importance of getting *the r
                                |ght ratings* (Star Trek was huge with the all important 18-25 male demographic, they just didn'
                                | bother to segment ratings that way at the time).////It wasn't about popularity. In those days,
                                |the BBC wiped ALL their shows. There was a strict limit on how you could rerun a program to pro
                                |ect actors jobs (a fear that you'd stop producing new content once you had enough to rerun). So
                                |a lot of famous British TV from that era is lost (Z-Cars is another example). Further, again, 2

                                |&gt;  it wasn't very successful during it's original run, if I remember correctly.////Yeah, it 
                                |nly ran for 26 seasons. Huge flop.


                                |It was hugely successful during its original run, airing in prime time in dozens of countries a

                |In a word: Cost.////["They were wiped or destroyed by the BBC during the 1960s and 1970s for economic and space
                |saving reasons."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes)


                |Just to let you know a lot of old Television and tons of silent cinema has been completely lost. I had an old f
                |lm archiving professor tell me that around 90% of silent films from the silent era no longer exist. (Meaning al
                | silent film clips we have seen today are from that 10%) They were disposable, after they had their runs they w
                |uld just toss them rather then spend lots of money preserving them. 


                    |And this was doubly true in the eras of rapid progression (introduction of sound film, colour film, colour 
                    |V). When colour TV started appearing in the late 60s/early 70s, they started throwing out black and white T
                    | compulsively, assuming that no one would ever want it again.//


        |They didn't lose them so much as destroy the originals. Remember this was back in the 60s and 70s.////[There were sever
        |l reasons for the destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes#Background). //Firstly they wer
        | stored on either large format video tapes or 16mm film reels so it was relatively bulky/expensive to store. //Secondly
        |thanks to actors union rules around screening repeats of shows was relatively expensive, so they never expected to be a
        |le to afford to show reruns. Finally they didn't think anyone would care about the show enough to want to watch old epi
        |odes again.


        |They didn't lose 9 episodes, they lost 106. You have to remember the show is 50 years old, back in the 1960s BBC didn't
        |have any proper archiving policies. So when they needed new tapes they just reused the old ones. So now they have 106 e
        |isodes with no archives with BBC and are looking for them all over the world. They are found in international distribut
        |on stocks or by private collectors. 


            |They lost quite a bit more than 106. It's just that they've recovered a bunch over the years. This is the biggest f
            |nd in quite a while though.


                |Yeah, that is correct. Sorry just got confused.

        |They were lost because way back when they taped the orignal shows were put onto magnetic tape. That was some expensive 
        |hit at the time. So at one point some bonehead wanted to save money so they ERASED a ton of episodes!! Just gone. So th
        | only way they find them again is if by some miracle like this someone had taped the episodes themselves and kept them 
        |afe since then. Hence why this is so amazing.


            |Too busy to write why this is wrong. In short: not a single bonehead, an industry standard, and not some home recor
            |er, only other tv stations by accident.


        |[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes).


        |A whole bunch of episodes were destroyed in the 70s. Before they were destroyed, they had been transferred to film and 
        |old off to other broadcasters all over the world.////Since then it's been an effort to find the dusty, lonely film cans
        |sitting in storage all over. The last big find was four episodes from Hong Kong back in the 90s.


    |Not even a fan of Doctor Who, and this excites me. I just love when lost film is found, and a whole serial is now complete,
    |which is awesome.


    |So wait.. didn't they just have a source for ALL the lost episodes in Ethiopia? Or was that just a false rumour?//


    |The 50th anniversary of the show is really shaping up to be a great year for a Doctor Who fan.  The 2nd Doctor's era was th
    | most effected by the BBC's wiping of tapes back in the early 70's.  I just finished the first two episodes of "Enemy of th
    | World" and couldn't be happier.  Patrick Troughton shines as both hero and villain.  Plus, we get to see The Great Intelli
    |ence and Yeti in "The Web of Fear".


    |Only nine? Wasn't the rumour that they found all of them?


    |What the BBC have said is that 9 episodes were "Returned" not found. People in the know are indicating that a lot more were
    |found but the BBC may well be negotiating with the parties who found them to get the prints back.//


    |They were found somewhere in Nigeria for those of you wondering where they were found


    |So this discovery completed one six-episode arc, and made another only need one more to be finished. The article says they'
    |l use stills to reconstruct the missing episode. Apparently both arcs are supposed to be available today on iTunes?////Edit
    | U.S. only: [Enemy of the World, $9.99](https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/doctor-who-enemy-world/id704921951). [The Web

        |They will be on dvd eventually


            |dvd?  how quaint...//


    |This gives me hope for the lost Dad's Army series 2 episodes.


        |Unfortunately, that one's a lot less likely. Doctor Who episodes are usually recovered from TV station archives around 
        |he world. Dad's Army had limited appeal outside UK/Australia and so there were far fewer copies made and distributed. 


            |Don't forget New Zealand


    |WooWho!


    |Wasn't it Ethiopia last week?


        |It was rumors last week


    |How does one lose videos in Nigeria? Some TV executive must've fallen for a Nigerian prince scam. 


        |Copies of the film were distributed to foreign countries to be aired after the shows original run. ////The original cop
        |es were destroyed by BBC. Many early television films from both USA and Britain were destroyed as film was expensive to
        |store and often just reused. No one had quite realized the value of keeping copies of the films yet.  


        |Actually the BBC deleted their copies, while someone in Nigeria held on to theirs.////Since the 80s people have been se
        |rching for other such forgotten copies.


        |From what I understand Doctor Who is or was very popular in Nigeria. I studied abroad in Ghana and it's popular there t
        |o, uploaded on torrent and streaming sites. And the Wikipedia page for Doctor Who missing episodes shows that there was
        |a Nigerian station known for broadcasting it.


        |I thought they found them in Ethiopia.  Oh well doesn't matter, hope they find more.


        |At this point we're getting episodes that fell through the cracks between record-keeping by the BBC and by the foreign 
        |tations they loaned episodes to. Tapes get misplaced, forgotten, mislabeled, stolen, "destroyed" instead of actually be
        |ng destroyed... and sometimes we get lucky. 


    |Not even going to lie, I shed a few tears of joy when I heard about this.


    |I hope these episodes destroy the current Canon!!  And the wiki pages has to be completely re-written-


        |We already have the audio, so they won't change canon a bit. Everybody knew what was in the stories


            |Should have never wandered into a world I didn't understand.  Thanks-


                |As well, they usually pretty fast and lose with continuity as it is. With both time travel and universe reconst
                |uction it leaves it pretty easy to hand wave things away. 


    |Is there a list of all the found episodes somewhere?


        |http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes#Recovered_episodes


    |There's a chance we've found more but I heard that the people that own them are asking for a ton of money for them - the be
    |ter these nine episodes do in sales the higher the chance of the BBC buying more.

    |Fantastich!  I have long dreamed of finding one myself, and claiming my very own to-scale Dalek.


    |Honestly, how could you lose over a hundred TV episodes. I mean.....all that effort, film, editing. Did the episodes just n
    |ver get aired and shelved or fall off a truck on the way to the TV station. 


        |they copoed them to sell over seas and then wiped the origial tape as they thought it would never be watched again and 
        |ould be a waste of space. This made sense up until the late 70s (when they eventually stopped). Originally some 170ish 
        |ere missing.


            |Not just that, but keeping it all would take up a ton of room.


            |I always thought that this show was like.....the gem of British pop culture. One would think they would have kept b
            |tter care of that stuff.

        |I can see why you'd come to that conclusion.////Keep in mind though that there weren't digital ways of storing data lik
        | there are now. Storing all those tapes took up a lot of space. Furthermore, tape was expensive so rather than buy new 
        |nes they were often reused.////When they say that they were destroyed, it's not like they made a huge pile of tapes, do
        |sed them in gasoline, and set fire to them.
