You like nice! Also we're Arin and Danny of Game Grumps. Ask us ANYTHING!!!!!!!!(/r/I Am A, where the mundane becomes fascinating and the outrageous suddenly seems normal.)




    |Did Barry really beat that Mario Sunshine Pachinko stage in ONE try?


        |i know he probably didnt... but gosh darn if i wont forever have that inkling of doubt.


        |Also, whose idea was it to end it on The Who? (I know the AMA has ended at this point; I just thought I'd throw this in
        |there)


            |gotta have been Barry.


            |Well, Arin did say "end it on The Who, Barry". We all heard it.


        |link to video?//


    |This is a question for Danny.////Someone posted on the GG subreddit that you were in a band called the Northern Hues. I che
    |ked it out, loved it, and bought the EP. I just wanted to know, what happened to that? Do you have plans to produce music o
    | that genre anymore, or just stick with NSP for as long as possible?////Also, a question relating to both NSP and Northern 
    |ues, what were your inspirations for the music?////#I love your stuff, and I'm glad NSP got publicity from the Game Grumps.
    |/////For Arin, ////Did you at any point where you wanted to seriously stop Game Grumps? ////What were the worst hardships w
    |en starting?////(sorry to have such downer questions for you, I couldn't think of anything else quick enough)


        |This is Danny, that's very sweet of you to say.  Northern Hues was over 10 years ago so I haven't even thought about it
        |in a long time.  There was a more recent "serious" band I was in called Skyhill that I'm a little prouder of.  ////I mi
        |ht go back to doing serious music sometime, but right now I'm having way too much fun with NSP and Starbomb


            |Dude... We need to hear more about Starbomb. I'm begging you, spill the beans.


                |https://efchan.net/bed/src/k1e7p7ubf2m8.jpg//There, happy?


            |Non-serious Danny is best Danny.


            |Hmm, Skyhill. I'll have to check that out then! ////Thanks for answering :)


            |Quick thing I've wanted to say for a while. ////In the song "I wanna F in your A", when you walk into the I.C.U., y
            |u called it the Intense Cuddling Unit.////Why wasn't it called the Intense Coitus Unit?////WHY DANNY!?


                |Sometimes you just gotta cuddle. You can't *ALWAYS* be having sex.


                    |But... He's Danny*Sex*bang...


                        |Danny Cuddlehug sounds sweet.


            |Skyhill was amazing. I love every single song! 


            |Oh, you tease. :)


            |I'm listening to Skyhill now and, I have to say, it's pretty fantastic. I always wondered what "serious" stuff from
            |you would sound like. 


                |Since it's kind of buried on the interwebz, [Skyhill link](http://www.sonicbids.com/2/EPK/?epk_id=116643#!audio


            |I'm really digging Skyhill. Its cool to see your skills in a different light; you're definitely a talented dude.///
            |On a different note, I want to say that I'm glad things have turned out more than okay for you on Grumps. You've ea
            |ily made me a big fan off what you do, and I'm happy that Grep graced our mortal souls with your musicality. ////Yo
            | and Arin and Ross and Barry all have this electric chemistry about you, and its something to look up to as someone

            |Hey Danny, here is a little friendly advice, get away from Arin and GG as soon as you can. Jon had the right idea.

            |you suffer. 


                |GETOUTTAHERE!!!!!! Not you, Danny, this "egofapper" troll.


                |So bro, how does it feel to literally be made of dicks?//Christ man, where do you people come up with this shit

            |You got me so pumped to see that. I actually said "oh.." In disappointment when I saw the link.


        |Oh man it killed me when they didn't put it on the screen during the episode.


            |You can't say you have a picture of that caliber and not show it.


                |NOT THAT PICTURE! GET IT OFF THE SCREEN!


                |Barry, put that in.


        |YES PLEASE//


        |I also would absolutely love to see this picture.


    |Would you put The Secret of Mana on hold and get a [SNES //Multitap](http://www.ebay.com/sch/?&amp;_nkw=SNES%20Multitap) to
    |play 3 player with Ross or Barry? Here is a list of the other [SNES //Games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNES_Multitap) it

            |I remember that, I think.  They later revealed it was a a joke about rape.  ////"What is your profession? I raped a
            |girl. What? Ohh... a PROfession, I was giving you a CONfession"////Its in the Joe and Mac episode.


            |There was one Sonic '06 episode with multiple censors in the form of a sad trumpet sound with the words "NO, JON" o

            |The loved the episode in Animal Crossing where Barry bleeped out Arin with the elephant. I almost died in that mome

            |i don't think that was "too real", they just don't want to be overly offensive


        |During Pokemon Emerald, they rerecorded a segment. They just talked over the video and replaced the original commentary
        | It's seamless, and at the time they announced it, no one had noticed. But they said it was obvious if you were looking
        |for it. They talked about this in their Magfest panel.


            |For that one I'm thinking it's when they went into the old man's house when he was chasing his wingull.

                |No idea.


                |The one with gamsmash


            |It was obvious in the fact that they completely changed topics and that you can hear the analog sticks of the Gamec

        |This is a very good question.  I've always wondered if they ever got super personal with each other while on the show.

            |I don't think Dan's been on long enough. I think this question would be more feasible with ^^^Jon.


        |There's an episode of Pokemon Emerald that has a place that was dubbed over.


        |I believe Arin mentioned that, back in the day, they redubbed some of Emerald. I'd be interested to know what and why!

        |wow what an interesting thought out question. to bad Arin will never answer it because he's a pussy.////I will however.
        |Yes////Jon will say nigger all the time, Arin made a few rape jokes, Jon called people who watch the show retards once,
        |and Arin and Jon would get into fights ALL THE TIME.////Also the reason Jon left was because he knew the show wasn't fu
        |ny and Arin to to greedy to stop. in the end Arin's greed ended their friend ship. Jon says he hats Arin now. 


            |&gt; Jon called people who watch the show retards////where?


        |These questions suck so bad. My question is much more important and interesting.


    |This blew up super fast. Are you guys sure you can answer all these questions?


        |Nope! ;D


            |Well at least you're honest.


            |Especially not anything relating to a certain persian gentleman 


    |I remember that in one episode of Epic Yarn, Arin was gonna tell a story about him, Ross, and Sharknado. What was it?


        |I was so excited for that story, then Danny had to *RUIN EVERYTHING.*


    |Hey guys, thanks for doing this AMA. //I've seen every episode of GG since it's humble beginnings. And I've been watching E
    |oraptor cartoons since I was about 11. ////What's the status on Guest Grumps? Will it ever happen again? ////Danny - how do
    |you feel about being catapulted to Game Grumps stardom and the fans obsession somewhat suddenly? ////Arin - why do you abst
    |in from drugs and drinking? I think it's an admirable thing to do, but I was wondering why you personally made that choice.


        |I'm not Arin, but I will say that I know several friends who do this. The common answer is usually due to being very un
        |omfortable with altering your mind and not being in control. Having stuff in your body, making you do things you would 
        |ot do, and so on.


            |Speaking as someone who follows a Straight Edge lifestyle, this guy knows what he's talking about.


            |I'm in the same boat. Heck, I can barely stop myself from doing stupid things when I'm sober.


            |I am straight edge for a few reasons. Mostly because I know a lot of people who drink and do drugs, and they are us
            |ally not the most admiral of people. Another reason is because my father was a drug abuser and an abuser in general
            | I try my best not to repeat mistakes. I don't have the money to waste on drugs and alcohol. Also alcohol makes my 
            |ody hurt. I drink only a little bit, and my body starts to ache. All my joints get sore after my first or second dr
            |nk.


            |Spot on my reason. Also I have seen people in both states and don't understand why anyone would want to do that to 
            |hemselves.


                |It's fucking awesome man, try it sometime.


                    |Why?


                        |Imagine every positive emotion that you feel, and multiply it tenfold. Something that would make you ha
                        |py makes you absolutely ecstatic - something that you would find funny, you find uncontrollably hilario
                        |s. You stop worrying about the little things, the things that don't matter, and other people's judgemen
                        |s, so you can be entirely free to discover deeper aspects of yourself that you were totally unaware of 
                        |n your normal, self-conscious state. It's liberating, enjoyable, and encourages personal growth. You ma
                        | believe that it makes you think less clearly, but really, it is just making you think more for *yourse
                        |f*, as opposed to thinking how you believe you *ough*t to think.////I'm a super positive person - laidb
                        |ck, "chill" - so for me, there is no problem whatsoever. Drugs are only, and have only ever been, a pos
                        |tive experience for me. There is a small percentage of people, of course, who are bubbling cauldrons of
                        |negative emotion. Drugs and alcohol multiply emotions, so, if you are always thinking and feeling bad t
                        |ings, you are going to have a bad time. This bad time has nothing to do with drugs, however - it has to
                        |do with their own personal problems. Once they sort their other problems out, however, they should tota
                        |ly start doing drugs.////Do whatever you want, of course. It doesn't phase me none. :) I just really do
                        |think that you are missing out, and altered states of consciousness definitely deserves a fair shot.


                            |See, to me it seems like you're **suppressing** emotions rather than enhance them, it's just the on
                            |s you deem bad. But being mad, sad, angry, that's what makes us human, as cheesy as it sounds.////I
                            |want to change my crappy life for the better, not ignore the crap by using drugs and alcohol to be 
                            |chill". I'm not saying drugs are inherently bad, I'm saying there's more merit in doing things the 
                            |ard way.

    |Hey Danny, How did you get chosen for the 'not so grump' spot? Did Arin just call you and say "hey wanna be a host and Game
    |Grumps?"//Edit: or the Steam Train spot.


        |The original idea for Steam Train was that it would premiere as a totally new show on the Game Grumps channel with Dann
        | and Ross, airing alongside Game Grumps.  And then Jon left abruptly and they needed someone to fill in. They already h
        |d two new people, so it was easiest to just pick one of them.////I am interested in why Danny was picked over Ross for 
        |ame Grumps, however. Probably related to scheduling or something.


            |I think that's fairly obvious. Danny is an entertainer. Ross can be entertaining but he's primarily an animator and
            |clever dude.


                |Nah, it was Ross' idea for steam train. So it's his show. He's the host of that, as Arin is the host of GG.


                |&gt;and clever dude.////Are we talking about the same Ross here?


            |Why did Jon leave abruptly? 


        |IIRC correctly Danny and Ross were on board and ready to start Steam Train for the channels first birthday, but Jon dec
        |ded to leave and Danny stepped up to fill the role; and the rest is history.

            |I appreciate him answering the question...but...he didn't mention my username. :(


        |I vote Fraser Agar from VGA for guest grumps.


        |Starbomb?


        |The first guest grumps happened because Jon was a huge fan of Grant. The next one will be from whoever pays Arin more m
        |ney, Arin is greedy like that 


            |Sure glad that won't be you ^_^


    |What's the deal with and status of this [Star Bomb](http://i.imgur.com/gcS3vZr.png) thing?


    |Arin, when you dyed the blonde into your hair, did you do it yourself, get Suzy to do it, or get it done professionally? An
    | problems with your roots?


        |I got it done professionally! Toni and Guy did it for me, there's actually a video of it online somewhere of me getting
        |it done for the first time! I have to get my roots redone every so often... it's a pain in the ass but I like it so muc
        |, it's worth it imo. I've always wanted it secretly but never had the balls to do it.


            |&gt; Toni and Guy////[Here you go](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuVyXUKfrDg)


                |I truly hope you're actually Dodger


                |Man, that glare between 0:56 and 1:00. He looks so mad that she's "playing" with her hair.


            |I've always kinda wanted to get it done myself.. I've had my hair chemically straightened but that's not quite as s
            |and-out.////What was it that finally made you go through with it? 


            |You should bleach your hair then dye it red. if you got a boner from a blonde streak then you'll have a room full o
            | jizz from dyeing it all red.


            |It looks good! 


    |Danny, what is your profession outside of Game Grumps/NSP? I've heard that you have a 9-5 job, but haven't heard what that 
    |ob is. So, what is this job, and do you enjoy it? When did you decide you wanted to take up this profession?////Thanks :)


    |To Arin - How is Game Grumps compared to what you originally thought it was going to be? Did you expect it to get this big?
    |///To Danny - What kind of shampoo do you use? Your hair is awe-inspiring.


        |**[Video response #5!](http://awe.sm/aGvH0)**

        |Arin just see's GG as a pay check. That is what he wanted it to be, but he never saw it as his #1 income. That's why Jo
        | left, Jon wanted to make something really good. Arin wanted to make something good enough and get a bigass pay check 


            |the jealousy is strong with this one...


            |When was any of that ever said, that's all complete bullshit. Like what the fuck dude, way to stir up shit.


    |What grumps-community joke do you guys like the most?

        |I think it's pretty obvious what they like da' mooost...


            |CAAYYK FJAARTS


    |Are there any games you want to play on Game Grumps, but haven't been able to for whatever reason?


        |All games. Every game. I love games, don't you? RPGs are hard to do, so maybe not a lot of those, but I dunno, I've got
        |a huge wall of games. Every Contra. All super action packed games. Treasure games. Pulseman. 


            |You love games?! Who are you and what have you done with Egoraptor?


                |He's like a father who's really but only because he loves his kid and doesn't want them to make bad decisions.


                    |I think you accidentally a word.


            |&gt; Pulseman////Yes.


                |Is it good? Every once in a while I'm like "I'm gonna track down all the other games that Game Freak made and p
                |ay then and " the thought stops there and I never, ever follow through.


                    |It's sort of like Mega Man mixed with Sonic.


                        |It sounds... beautiful.


                            |It's on the Wii Virtual Console, so it shouldn't be hard to find at all.


            |I'm guessing FPSs won't be done for either obvious or not so obvious reasons.


                |Haven't you seen their CS:GO or Quake III Arena videos?


                    |._. I was unaware they had done those. My statement was leaning more towards more mainstream FPS (Halo, COD
                    |^^^^^^please ^^^^^^^don't ^^^^^^^hurt ^^^^^^^me , BF) I know Arin thinks they are all the same and get kind
                    | bland, but I think at least some of those could have some decent moments. Unless those would require more 
                    |ocus in which the narrative aspect would almost become null.


                        |&gt; My statement was leaning more towards more mainstream FPS (Halo, COD, BF)////That's just console m
                        |instream. Counter Strike and Quake are totally mainstream on the PC.


                            |COD is PC as well, but I get what you're putting down.


            |Drill Dozer?


                |echh


                |Yeah let's vibrate the crap out of Arin's gamecube!


            |Fun fact, Pulseman was the inspiration behind Rotom.


            |Gunstar heroes pls!


            |Maybe this is something that could be its own thing on the GG channel. A longplay of a game. Comes out once a month
            |or something along those lines. I think it would be fun to watch you guys play more RPGs, but the current format of
            |10 minutes does not lend itself well for RPGs.


            |Video games are the only reason I haven't gone insane yet.


            |Please play Bangai-O.


            |So nothing in particular?  Or more to the point, no spoilers?


    |How did Arin and Danny meet?


        |i think they talked about this and said it was during the animation Arin did for NSP


        |It was foretold in the Scrolls.


            |...1 hour later, they never answered me.


                |There are THOUSANDS of questions in that thread. I'd advise being patient, and given the way AMAs have gone for
                |other celebrities, don't get your hopes up if you got your question in outside of the first half hour.


                    |My question was one of the first, if they haven't gotten to it yet, I can't imagine how many people will be
                    |let down. 


                        |They answered your question in one of the episodes. Arin made some animation for a NSP music video and 
                        |hat's how he met Danny.


                        |Watch the video response channel and see how it goes. Or maybe it was too similar to something they ask
                        |d already.


    |What is your favorite Barry moment?


    |Arin, I don't care if you never animate again, but please give us the final girlchan episode. I've waited so long.


        |I think I saw somewhere that Girlchan was officially canceled, shame too because it was one of my favourites


    |Do you guys ever get burned out when recording for the show? 


        |**[Video response #2!](http://awe.sm/t3cwc)**


        |I wonder if there is a real pressure to be funny or if they're just themselves. Doesn't really matter to me either way,
        |but still sorta curious!


            |There are a bunch of episodes where I'd say they aren't necessarily funny, but the conversations they have are stil
            | entertaining to listen to.//I imagine they're just being themselves; they're two pretty funny dudes.


        |They did a video response to this one, click the link in the header!


        |There is no way they don't. Did you watch the Super Mario Sunshine series near the end. My favorite one is "I Hate This
        |Fun" or the one they do the plinko level had me actually laughing out loud.


    |INEVITABLE SONIC 06 QUESTION?


        |**[Video response #3!](http://awe.sm/bGv75)**


            |FINALLY, CLOSURE


                |Finally, sidestep


            |Answer for those who can't watch?


                |The answer was no for a few reasons:////1) It wouldn't feel right because they didn't start it together and it 
                |ould be weird for Danny to come in just for the last little bit.////2) Obvious JonTron issues (of course, they 
                |idn't say this, but it was implied by answer 1).////3) Arin's not sure what else he could do with it anyway. Th
                |re are only so many good moments that can come of basically going, "Wow! This game is shit! Look at this shit! 
                |t's so shitty!" It wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to finish it at this point.


                |Yeah, seriously! 


            |It's been suggested that you could play with Barry instead of Danny, since Barry was at least around for the rest o
            | it. There's not a lot else to *say* about the game, but the whole game was build up for watching you play End of t
            |e World, the legendarily awful ending levels. The whole reason people want the game finished so bad is to see that.
            |Since you haven't played through it, it's understandable that you don't understand. But trust me when I say, you ca
            |'t just not attempt End of the World after making it as far as you did. It's against the law in, like, 26 states.

        |n mentions that he watched the episodes, and does know the horror. Arin says there's nothing more to say about the game
        |other than 'THIS GAME IS BAD!' and Dan agrees saying that they're going to let Sonic '06 lie.////Disclaimer: The videos

        |Better yet, Sonic Generations PC (aka the only one that runs at 60FPS)?


            |its like sonic 06 backwards so you know isrlygood


            |Not a good game for blind playthroughs tho. It shines when replaying stages over and over, but they'd likely do a v
            |ry confused first run and leave it at that.


            |I'd enjoy Steam Train - Sonic 06////edit - OH SHIT I'm a dumbass. For some reason I read "Sonic 06 PC". Hopes were 
            |rought to an ultimate high. Needless to say Steam Train probably wouldn't be good to play a console game.


                |A console game on Steam Train?! Get outta here!


                |Generations is actually good though, well, ok...


                |Sonic Generations was released on PC. I just said it was the only one (out of all the versions released) that r
                |n at 60FPS.


            |I have an Nvidia Optimus laptop so it didn't run at 60FPS for me :(


            |They should definitely play Generations!////I want to see them try to get all S ranks (it's not *that* hard; I suck

    |//* So is it safe to say that Zelda Sequelitis has been scrapped at this point? I know a lot of us were looking forward to

    |lanned in the future?////**For Mr. Sexbang:**////* How were you invited to join Game Grumps? Did you watch the show at all 
    |efore joining the crew?////* I remember you mentioning that 3D games made you sick at one point. Is that still the case? Is
    |that the reason why you didn't play Super Mario Sunshine on the show?//


        |It's just Dan and me here! Zelda Sequelitis is actually in HEALTHY development! I can't make any promises when it'll be
        |out but it'll be AWESOME when it's out! It's my favorite, but I say that about all my upcoming videos... except Awesome
        |Rising. That video sucks.////I have many sequelitiseseseses coming in the future! I wanna do a Mario one. Whoops did th
        |t just slip out. 


            |&gt; Zelda Sequelitis is actually in HEALTHY development!////That's very awesome news! I hope we can all see it soo


                |I hope we see it when he thinks it's ready. /groompier than thou//or can I do something like retweeted by humbl
                | brag with this...


            |A Mario Sequelitis would be great if you didn't *irrationally hate Galaxy*


                |I would actually be THRILLED to hear him articulate his "irrational hate"


                    |He touched a bit on this during the SMB3 playthrough, IIRC it has a lot to do with how old Mario games were
                    |kind of an evolution of each other and added something, but the last few were just kind of continuations of
                    |the same theme.


                        |I remember that, and I think he was referring more to the New Super Mario Brothers series. He's talked 
                        |bout that a lot in Grumps.


                    |I'd rather watch them play Galaxy 2 on the show. Maybe Danny this time, so Arin can assess the game without
                    |the, uh, unfiltered rage that Mario games can bring. ^Lookin' ^at ^you, ^Sunshine


                        |Why not both?


                            |Why not just the good one?


                |Arin doesn't hate Galaxy. He has never said that.


                    |Today's episode of SMB3 had unfavorable statements about the newer games.


                        |He was talking about the New Super Mario Bros. games.


                            |Maybe. I'd agree with that, those games *are* lazy.


                                |But isn't that the point of the games? To be simple games that call on the original 2D platform
                                |rs. I mean NSMB2 on 3DS is mostly comprised of levels designed by people at Nintendo who normal
                                |y don't work on Mario titles and were asked to design on what they remember from their youth pl
                                |ying the games.//Now that doesn't exactly give an excuse for the laziness, but its hard to faul
                                | them on it when they're very upfront about those games.


                                    |Still disappointing for people who grew up while they were introducing tons of new stuff ea
                                    |h game, though. 


                        |He's talking about the New super mario bros series, not all super mario games. He has talked about lovi
                        |g Galaxy before on grumps.


                |If he talks about it, he will surely try his best to rationalize his argument.////Don't call someone's argument
                |irrational until they've actually elaborated on it.


                |Do you think he's gonna touch on Galaxy?  So far he's only done NES and SNES era games.//Just the jump from 2D 
                |o 3D would be interesting.  Or maybe Nintendo's gradual return to the old Mario style (Galaxy 2, 3DLand and 3DW
                |rld) from the broader, more exploration-based games like 64 and Sunshine.////It'd be cool to see sort of a broa
                |er franchise sequelitis some time.  


                |What a strange game to hate.


                |Normally Arin's distaste in games is rationalized. While we might not agree with it, we can at least see from h
                |s perspective WHY he doesn't like it.//Eventhoughmariogalaxywasfuckingamazingandiloveitarinhowcouldyou.


                |Yeah he was hating on Mario today because nothings new. But then he hates Galaxy? What the hell Arin?


                |Why does Arin hate Mario Galaxy?


                    |Because *it's not new enough*


            |I'd love to you do a Mario Sequelitis. Cannot wait for that Zelda!////EDIT: my brain tooted real bad

                |I feel like I'm the only one nervous about the Zelda Sequelitis. given Arin's attitude towards modern marios an
                | some of his small tidbits on Zelda during some episodes I'm afraid it may just be Arin ranting on the modern Z

                |cs for bad or worse between each game. I just hope that gets through in the episode.


            |WOOT!


            |I'm not sure if you've been asked this before, so sorry if it's a repeat, but how would you feel about other people
            |adopting the sort of format that Sequelitis has, comparing a game to it's sequel, and doing their own sort of thing
            |with it?//I'm currently starting up a gaming website, and our focus is on editorial style articles, so I was intere

        |As for me, I loved the show before I joined!  3D games we're tough for me to handle at first, but now I'm cool with the

                    |If we do get to vote, I vote for Mega Man Legends. If we do not get to vote, then… oh.

            |I JUST WANT EVERYONE TO MOVE ON. SHEESH.////Edit: Seriously, is that so much to ask for?////Edit Edit: Apparently.


                |It is in a subreddit about asking people anything.


                |Ask Me *Anything* 


                |They had to have known this would come up, and my argument would just be that they should have made this an AMA
                |.  Then they have their 'out' for not answering it.


        |Some of it is explained in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1n33qb/a_quick_statement_from_jont
        |on/).


            |All that tells me is that the breakup more likely than not involved bad blood. It's obvious that Jon left suddenly 
            |ithout preparation, and this just makes it seem even more like the whole situation is melodramatic.


                |Really?  I had the exact opposite reaction.////I didn't think much of Jon leaving at first but as time goes by 
                |t seems like something bad did happen.  Arin and Danny carefully avoid talking about him and Jon's message care
                |ully avoided stating any real reason for his departure.////Also him saying this:////&gt;and I feel like it was 
                | move made to get your support more than 'help me out'////really sounds like resentment to me.////Not that I ca
                |e for the drama but it's VERY obvious that there is some legal gag order here (Arin even said he couldn't talk 
                |bout it).  That doesn't mean it's necessarily bad blood but I couldn't imagine what else would have caused some
                |hing like this.


                |People are gonna speculate, and without answers Jon will never truly escape the stigma.  It's gotta come out at
                |some point.  I only hope they realize this lesson sooner rather than later.  It doesn't matter who you are.  On
                |e you get enough fame for a fanbase, you cannot control dirty laundry (real or imagined) or its damaging effect

        |Considering they're sitting in the Polaris studio doing this AMA, I have a feeling this won't get answered.


            |Why?  What does Polaris have to do with Jon?


                |GG and Jon both have contracts with Polaris.  And based on the way both sides handled the split, there are almo
                |t certainly business-related reasons that prevent them from talking openly about the details of what happened./

                    |I had no idea they had a "boss"////I don't know how I feel about this.


                        |I use the term somewhat loosely.  AFAIK, Polaris gives their content creators full creative control, bu
                        | they offer them extra money to participate in promos (e.g., the XBLA Summer of Arcade games, the Pacif

                        |usly providing the set/crew/resources to do the video responses, which is why I didn't expect the Grump

        |Wasn't it because he wanted to focus on his own show and he was moving to N.Y with his girlfriend? I don't know, it's n

            |That is what they WANT you to think.


            |That's exactly what it was, but people decided not to believe what both Jon and Arin told them because wild conspir

            |I think Jon disconfirmed the moving to N.Y. thing

        |ories of last winter, when I stayed home for a few days from school because I was sick. I played Ni No Kuni every day, 
        |nd I had Grumps playlists in the background every time (They were making the You Don't Know Jack videos then, and those
        |were great). //I finished Ni No Kuni in 60 hours. I had Game Grumps playing on my computer for 60 hours. //It got to th
        | point where I would replay videos I'd already seen before over and over, just to hear their voices and feel like they 
        |ere there with me. //Have all the new shows made Game Grumps worse? No, absolutely not. The channel is still great. But
        |there's been this feeling ever since Jon left. This feeling that's not quite right. //I still watch episodes from "The 
        |on days" all the time. I cried on the day it was announced that Jon left. I listened to Grump remixes, and I cried. ///
        |So I guess what I'm saying is, the people have started to move on. There aren't any more Grump Videos with extreme amou
        |ts of trolly dislikes. The top comment on every video isn't "BRING JON BACK" anymore. But I think I speak for a lot of 
        |eople when I say I won't be able to move on fully until there's some fully fleshed out, complete resolution.  //I don't
        |know if it's true, but based on what I've seen and heard it seems as if Jon and Arin had some kind of fight. If one of 
        |he Grumps proves me wrong, I'll be fine. //But please, guys. For me. If you are having some kind of argument, settle it
        | Be friends. Please. //Thank you for reading this, //Forever a fan, //-Phlough


            |I may have only come here to hear the full story about Jon, but I love these guys and tune in every day--sometimes 
            |ven watching reruns.  I just wanna get the past behind me.  The longer they deny me an answer, the more the thought
            |chews in the back of my mind that, hey, actually telling whatever happened must be so bad that they'd rather have a
            |l their holdover fans trapped in limbo wondering what the hell happened.  And that never really goes away.////Cheer
            |, mon.////* EDIT: I also won't lighten up on Arin in particular, because I trust him to be an intelligent and consi
            |erate individual who should've seen this coming a mile away.  There are many other celebrities and semi-celebrities
            |who I would just let slide with this stuff just for the sake of them not caring or thinking things through...not Ar
            |n.  C'mon man.  Even a "yes, you are exactly right" would suffice as closure for hundreds of thousands.


            |Perfectly stated, and I feel the exact same way. This past year was very tough for me, and most days I couldn't wai
            | to get home and relax with some Grumps. No matter how bad the day was, I could look forward to at least 20 minutes
            |of entertainment, usually followed by rewatching an entire game or two in the background of whatever else I was doi
            |g. If I was sick, I would just bundle up, put a playlist on, and pass out with the comfort of hearing Jon and Arin 
            |anter endlessly. They quickly became an integral part of my life, and I was always excited to share their stuff wit
            | friends.////It also really warms my heart whenever I hear about other people taking Jon's departure as hard as I d
            |d. I haven't cried in a very long time, but I would also watch GG remixes and openly weep for a while after Jon lef
            |, even having moved on and accepted Danny. Hell, I still get all blubbery during the break in the Triforce anthem w
            |th Jon and Arin laughing.////Honestly, the emotional significance of this silly channel to me and, apparently, many
            |others was baffling, but it really did feel like I was actually getting to hang out with the Grumps every day. Ever
            | time they would let some personal detail or story slip out I would be delighted that I had gotten to know them bet
            |er, despite the overwhelming odds that they will never know I exist. That's why the new season has had that odd fee
            |ing about it; not mentioning Jon's departure is understandable, but the entire past year of Grumps, all the games p
            |ayed and discussions had, Jon's existence as a whole- these have not even been mentioned in passing! This probably 
            |elt the weirdest for me when the old Secret of Mana file was overwritten without Arin saying anything.////I accept 
            |hat Jon has moved on and will not be coming back, but the whole situation is just surrounded by an aura of uncomfor
            |able. There is a pretty significant difference between being stuck in the past and acknowledging it. Shouldn't Jon 
            |nd Arin's friendship mean more to them than to me and a bunch of Youtube subscribers?////Anyway, I hope this didn't
            |come out too rambly (and super late to the party), but the Jon issue really means a lot to me and many others, and 
            | know we've put too much emotional investment into this to let it just blow over.


                |Yes! Glad to know I'm not alone!


            |How did game grumps become so much a part of your life that you cried when Jon left? Unless you have some other iss
            |es harbored up inside yourself, the absence of someone you don't even know in real life could not possibly warrant 
            |hat kind of reaction. Forgive me for not being empathetic.


                |Let's say you've been watching a TV show for several months, and then suddenly you're favorite character got ki
                |led off, or the show got altogether cancelled, without any warning. Wouldn't you be pretty sad? And if you watc
                |ed old episodes or tributes, wouldn't you be pretty sad? 


                    |I have had emotional investments on arrested development, invader zim, studio 60, Avatar: the last airbende
                    |, to name a few of many, many shows. They all were cancelled prematurely, but I never had the slightest inc
                    |ination to cry about it. Sure it was always *kind* of sad, but what were they really adding to my life? ///
                    |When my Grandparents died, I cried. What do you think they added to my life?


                        |Alright, I'm not going to try to raise another point, because you've had a similar situation with telev
                        |sion shows and didn't react. We have different opinions on this situation, and that's fine. I just want
                        |an answer, to this question, because it's important to me, even if it seems foolish to you. 


                            |To answer your question I never get sad, I only get angry at either the writers for their poor choi
                            |es or the viewing audience for not appreciating what they've been given. ////Perhaps this is becaus
                            | I place too many expectations on others. ////Do I judge people too much?////


                                |Oh no, I didn't mean an answer to your question, I meant an answer as to why the Game Grumps di
                                | what they did, as posed by Martijo at the beginning of this thread. I think that you think in 
                                | perfectly normal, logical way. There's nothing wrong with having high expectations. And it's n
                                |rmal to be angry when disappointed. 


                        |Not everyone has the presence of mind to consider and rationalize their choice of reaction before actua
                        |ly reacting.  It's pretty natural to cry at losing something dear, no matter what else.  I will never b
                        | ashamed to cry at Mega Man Legends 3 getting cancelled "just because it's a game".  The very act showe

                            |There is no shame in emotion, because without it we are not human. I'm thinking that the point I am
                            |trying to make is that keeping a healthy and alert mind and body helps us to reflect on our passion
                            | without an overly subjective perspective clouding our judgement. Crying could possibly be the poin
                            | at which the threshold has been broken and the passion turns into the *obsession*, which in my opi
                            |ion, is dangerous.

        |You fucking idiots, I love you guys.


        |~~Tom~~*Hank* called me a great judge of character. ////I can die happy.


    |Arin, at what point did you think that a show about you and JonTron gaming would be something you're interested in? Was it 
    |ust something that one of you brought up in a conversation, or was there some other inspiration?


        |I think I know the origin story here: They were playing brawl together with friends when they got into an argument over
        |whether or not Wolf was too similar to Fox (Jon thought so, Arin did not) when one of their friends said something like
        |this "Jeez why don't you guys just make a show where you argue about games and call it game grumps". 


    |How far in advance do you generally record your episodes? For example, people are raging and yelling over your Secret of Ma
    |a knowledge. How late do you see them? I've noticed that you don't seem to pick up on the hints until well into the series,
    |if at all.


        |Like the fact that everyone can charge weapons or that you have to use magic to level it up....And all the orbs they mi
        |sed!


    |What program does Barry use to edit the show?  Also, who is more scared of the other, Barry or Ninja Brian?


        |I THINK Barry uses Adobe Premier, but I could be wrong.


            |I believe its Premier pro and After affects, but I could be wrong


                |Ah, left off the pro, lol. I think you're more correct than I am.


        |Are you implying that Ninja Brian even feels fear? Or any emotion besides rage? God help you...


    |Arin, it seems like you're primarily into retro games, or at the very least retro-styled games. What's your favorite game r
    |leased in the past 5 years or so?////And Danny, how does it feel to be such a gloriously majestic beast?


    |I know you're going to get hundreds of questions with this similar topic, but...////Arin, do you still keep in touch with J

                |What makes Jon the villain there?  I'd hate having words put in my mouth too.


                    |After months of not commenting on the issue of him leaving, he suddenly reappears in the subreddit to "clea
                    | everything up" just in time after his new episode was up. ////Apparently him saying that he wanted to move
                    |on and not to be associated with Game Grumps anymore was a lie, a lie he never refused until he wanted thos
                    | old fans back watching his content, sounds more like someone that regretted sacrificing those numbers in t
                    |e view count. ////He also, several times, kind of says Arin lied in order to get rid of him, which is a cle
                    |r manipulation of his words, since he takes a comment Arin did out of context at a time when everyone was t
                    |ying to figure out what happened, also, this wonderful line: "...why would I want you to stop talking about
                    |me? It's simply ridiculous. I hope you can all take this to heart. I am not trying to put Game Grumps behin
                    | me, but maybe they are? Food for thought ;D"////He completely threw Arin under the bus in a totally unprof
                    |ssional manner, and at this point, this comment he so graciously ignored says it all: ////"Are you kidding 
                    |e with that last sentence? Egoraptors statement was in favor of you both. While it did sound as if he wante

        |ke 10 days. Arin mentions that it was mayor luigi that won everyone over, and Dan says that mayor luigi was what won hi
        |self over, because he thought he sucked until that moment and Arin agrees with him about mayor luigi. Dan reiterates th

        |cool.////Sequelitis isn't mentioned.////Disclaimer: The videos are worth watching, but I know sometimes circumstances w
        |n't allow it. I'll consider this my good deed for the day, and yours can be clicking the link once you're able to.


            |I actually was able to watch the video, but I didn't know they responded to my question! Thanks for the transcripti
            |n and the heads up! Good work.


                |no problem. I use my 3DS to get on reddit at work alot (I'm one of the few plebeians alive today without a smar
                | phone) so if I were working today I'd be missing out on these answers. I know they probably want the traffic o
                | Polaris's site, and I don't have the skill/patience to transcribe the videos verbatim, so I added the disclaim
                |r, but I know if I couldn't watch the video responses I'd at least like a tl;dr version of their answer in the 
                |omments.


    |/u/DannySexbang: My husband picked you up and curled you at PAX for a photo op. Question 1: How did that make you feel? Que

        |That is glorious 


        |I was like "Oh look it's Danny" and then i scrolled down, and I had a double take - didn't even register Arin and Ross 
        |t first.


    |What are your thoughts on the over use of some of the memes from the show?


    |Arin, what is your current view of Newgrounds?


    |Dear Grumps,////Are there any highly requested games from fans that you don't want to play, or are putting off right now fo
    | some reason?


    |Dan, please slap Arin. No reason, just do it. Thank you.


    |Two quick things:////1. Any chance of doing more guest grumps soon? The grant one was awesome! ////2. I just wanted to say 
    |hat you guys, ross, barry, and suzy are all awesome. For every rude youtube comment or spiteful email, there are hundreds o
