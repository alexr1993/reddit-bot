                            |Oh. Yeah, that wasn't clear.


                            |That's fucking stupid.

                    |Well thank you!


                        |Not you, DEEP_ANUS.


                            |It's hard being an anus :(


            |Also, your "modeling process" and "layout process" are literally the same image, only one has shading turned on. 


                |*That* one wasn't my fault. That's what it says [here](http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graph
                |cs/monsters-university-behind-scenes-from-sketchbook-screen/).


                    |I actually saw that after I made the comment and felt bad. I found it hilarious because the difference betw
                    |en "Modeling" and "Layout" is *literally* clicking one button on the keyboard, but the difference between "
                    |nimation" and "Final" is, like, weeks if not months of work. 


                        |It explains in the text the difference.  Modeling is literally just making the individual models by the
                        |selves.  Layout is placing those models into a scene with a camera, to get the right proportions and vi
                        |ws etc.////It's a little more difficult to take a screenshot of a bunch of different model files that a
                        |e disorganized, so I assume that's why they cheated and just used the same shot as the layout shot.


                        |But it's *not* literally clicking one button. Look at the purple thing at the very right on both, I thi
                        |k you may discover that you're wrong.


                    |Those guys are quite wrong when it comes to the Pixar workflow. You might look a bit into that, next time p
                    |sting a "process/development" picture. A lot of essential steps are missing, as well as the modelling and w
                    |reframes shown, are only the layout models, not the actual models you see in the final movie, as their wire
                    |rame is a lot more dense. Just a heads up! It is nice though you share the backside of CG films, but it wou
                    |d nice if the accurate information was actually posted, so people don't think "ah man, it looks so easy, I 
                    |et it only took them an afternoon" - While these films take years and years to do, and even just rigging al
                    |ne, can take more than half a year to create.////(I'm a CGI student, taught by various of people from Pixar

                    |So why not just post that article to begin with?


                        |Mobile users.


                            |Thanks for caring OP. -hugs- 


                                |[You cutie!](http://i.imgur.com/XEL5hjN.gif)


                |I would've said one is in wireframe, but same thing. 


                |The modeling process is where they build the models for the first time.  Layout process is where they will do t
                |e final positioning of everything.  While you are 'technically' correct they are only seperated in the images b
                | a single button, it's actually a lot more lengthy process to get to the end of the modeling phase. 


            |Modeling and layout image is the same image one with wireframe and one without. :P It also very simple blockout mod
            |ls so basically it's models for the layout, not the models actually used in the movie. I checked the article too, t
            |ey are just simplifying it for people who have no clue. :)


            |Yeah. This isn't Youtube. When you get corrected on reddit, you THANK the person.


            |You're not wrong, color scripting is under the umbrella of concept art.

            |What is this? A color-script for ants?!


        |I wish it were this simple.


        |I think that it's quite an insane process. Imagine doing this for every frame in the movie. Wonder what pcs they're usi
        |g. 


        |Some cool facts about Pixar films:////The whole process of making a Pixar film can take 4-7 years depending on length a
        |d detail required.////[The sequel to Monsters Inc., "Monsters University", with a server farm of over 2000 computers, t
        |ok *29 CPU hours* to render *each frame*.](http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/24/the-making-of-pixars-latest-technological-
        |arvel-monsters-university/)////Sully has 5.5 million individually rendered furs on his body, compared to a fifth of tha
        | in the original film.


            |That must be 29 CPU hours, not 29 "real" hours, if that number is correct, and we assume about 95 minutes of footag
            | (cutting away intro and credits etc), that would mean that it should have taken////95 * 60 * 24 * 29 / 24 / 365 = 
            |452 years to render.////Not that 29 CPU hours is not an impressive number.


                |I don't know how useful/correct/relevant this is, but that article that u/brighterside linked contains this:///
                |&gt;All told, it has taken more than 100 million CPU hours to render the film in its final form. If you used on
                | CPU to do the job, it would have taken about 10,000 years to finish. With all of those CPUs that Pixar did hav
                |, it took a couple of years to render.


                |You forgot that they used 2000 computers.


            |For a one hour film it's 65 days at 29 hours per frame spread over to 2000 computers, versus 130 000 days (360+ yea
            |s) at 29 real hours. So it's 29 CPU hours and not as implicitly said real hours.


            |I'm sorry, but that doesn't add up. Those numbers are what the original Toy Story took to render.////There are 24 f
            |ames on a second. imdb lists the movie as 104 minutes. Let's do the math to aproximate numbers.////24 frames * 60 s
            |conds * 104 minutes =  149760 frames////149760 frames * 29 hours = 4343040 hours////4343040 hours / 24 hours = 1809
            |0 days////180960 days / 365 days = 495 years////No, I don't think 29 hours to render each frame. ////I'm pretty sur
            | there are shots that really put against the ropes the render farms, and that from the first time they made a final
            |render of a shot to when when they had it all took 2 years like the article says. Hell, maybe *some* shots took tha
            | much and they used the whole place to render them in separate racks for each frame and put it together. But no way
            |every single shot took 29 hours to render.////It doesn't add up the 10,000 years either. In a rack with 8 CPU per s
            |rver and 8 servers in the rack, that would be reduced 156 years. Keeping in mind the number of hypothetical racks l
            |ke that one in a hypotetical Pixar-sized render farm, that number goes easily to one year, two if we're to take eve
            |y single shot that ended up rendering. So, if we're to believe it took 2 real life years, for a combined 495 years,
            |you need to fit around 250 frames every 29 hours, or around 11 seconds of images that later need to be put together
            | So, they actually don't make a frame every 29 hours, more like 250 if not more of them. Kind of misleading.////The
            |whole thing to me doesn't add up, but please check my math and logics. I just know I heard the around 29 hours a fr
            |me back in 1999 and Moore's Law and the size of those places should speed it up. Also they're are developing severa
            | things at a time. Did it take that much to render this year's Halloween special?////I don't know.


        |If they could animate the colour script, that would've been great.  Love the darker tone of if.  Wasn't Disney working 
        |n some painting coming to life animation technique?


            |Yes, they used it on a short called Paperman.

                        |I must know you!


                |Maybe he's just really into Megamind.


        |Out of curiosity, how long does it take to make a frame for a movie!


            |Senshisentou's description is about right.  However, I'd estimate it takes much longer.  The shot may change many t
            |mes as it gets passed from department to department.  It may spend more time in layout depending on whether or not 
            |t is a complicated shot, and the same goes for animation and lighting.  It also depends if there is a lot of effect
            | or simulations (cloth, hair, etc).  Those are often done by a completely different department.  I actually have no
            |idea how long it takes layout to do their work, but animators spend hours on each shot as they go back and make rev
            |sions based on critique and notes from people in charge.  When it gets passed to the lighters, they spend most of t
            |eir time doing test renders of single frames or a series of frames, but not the whole length of the shot.  You can 
            |o local tests on a machine with enough ram, or send test frames off to a render farm.  Depending on the pass, the f
            |ame can take a few minutes to... well, hours.  Machines range from having 12gb of ram to 48gb where I work.  You on
            |y send off a full range of frames to render once the shot is close to complete and the only changes they think they
            |ll want to make can be done in compositing programs.  Who knows, though- if another department comes up with revise
            | animation or a new simulation, you may have to render again, doubling the amount of time and resources spent rende
            |ing that shot.////Depending on the size of the studio, there also may be small teams for composting tweaks, checkin
            | the image in stereo, and a whole host of other tiny things you wouldn't think about.////A shot also has to be appr
            |ved in various departments as it moves through the pipeline, so even though it may not take weeks of actual work, i
            | will definitely take weeks to get all the way through (even months).  This is why this stuff takes so many years f
            |om beginning to end.


            |That's a difficult question to answer, in part because it depends on what you want to include in your definition of
            |"making a frame".////In this case for example, those monsters weren't made for just this particular frame. They are
            |modeled, rigged and textured once, and are then used all across the movie. The same goes for sets and set elements 
            |ike buildings, trees, rocks, etc.////After that it's "just" a "simple" matter of placing the monsters and the envir
            |nment in the scene, posing the characters by moving their "skeleton bones", adding lights to scene, rendering and f
            |nally adding some post-processing effects like depth of field.////It's therefore hard to give an estimate on the ti
            |e it takes to build a single frame. Let's say that setting up just this one frame took about an hour (assuming all 
            |he models were already finished). Now let's also assume they made this into a 3-second shot. 3D animation heavily r
            |lies on interpolation. That means you only have to pose the important frames, the rest get filled in "automagically
            |. If animating the shot then took an additional hour, the time per frame suddenly comes down to (60m to set up the 
            |cene + 60m to animate = 120m) / (3 second shot * 24fps = 72 frames) = 1^2/3 minutes per frame.


                |&gt; 3D animation heavily relies on interpolation////I seriously doubt there are many interpolated keyframes le
                |t in a pixar shot like this. Animation at this level is tweaked on every frame over and over.////


                |Thank you for that. It's interesting to see the work that goes into these projects.


            |I think it is always 24 hours.//Fellowship of the Ring 1 day to render 1 frame//Return of the the King 6 years late
            | and much more expertise/money, 1 day to render 1 frame.


                |Uhh, hang on - 201 minutes running time x 60 seconds x 24 fps = 289440 days of cg rendering? granted, not all o
                | the movie would need cg, but even then, 24 days for a single second of animation?


                    |Yep, that's why these movies are rendered at render farms... Thousands of CPUs render thousands of frames a
                    | once 


                    |I'm not sure how accurate the day thing is but they have huge farms of very expensive computers to multi ta
                    |k all these frames. Still takes a while. ////Edit: someone below me had a link monsters uni took 29 hours p
                    |r frame but they also had 2000 computers, so there you go. 


                    |Several frames are rendered simultaneously! So no, not 24 days for a single second.


                    |They render more than one frame at once.


                    |It's all about cpu hours. If one cpu takes 24 hours to render a frame, you can split the work among thousan
                    |s of connected servers and reduce the amount of time needed to render the entire movie.


                    |It definitely isn't that long, even the parts with very much cgi won't take 24hours to render 1 frame, that
                    |s just bullshit.

        |Thanks for sharing this video.  It is really cool.


        |Haha, clicked on the comments just to say this.

            |They should animate an entire movie in one of those styles.


                |It would probably take even longer than their current methods.


            |It's art on its own


                |Hence the second word being 'art'.


            |Is it me or do these concept art sketches really capture the atmosphere of the scene.


                |That's exactly what they hire those people to do. :)


            |SO MANY FUTURE WALLPAPERS!


            |I love the art style. Very awesome.


            |colorscripts


                |Only two of those are color scripts, I think.


        |On the one hand, yes, animation takes a ton of patience.  On the other hand, it's very engaging because you get a lot o
        | visual feedback as you work.////I feel like, ultimately it doesn't take an exceptional amount of patience or anything,
        |it's just a matter of the kinds of things you're able to focus on and get enjoyment out of.  For some people tweaking a
        |curve dozens of times until a sweeping arm motion looks juuust right is its own kind of fun.////Of course, all that sai
        |, a feature length movie is an enormous undertaking.////(I do animation and I do some programming, and I think programm
        |ng takes way more concentration and patience)


            |For me programming just takes a lot more pacing around and mulling stuff over. And maybe more being okay with stuff
            |not working the first 20 tries or so.


            |What little animation I've done I've found very difficult. I think it's because I'm training as a realistic artist 
            |nd I find it very hard to loosen up in the way that animation requires (all those in-between frames, gah!). I love 
            |eeing top quality animation and completely admire anyone who can put the work in to do their own.


    |I love the solemn looks they all have in 'layout' process.


    |The modelling process would actually be done separately, or this bracket was just labelled incorrectly. Once the models and
    |rigged and skinned separately in a T pose, they'd be placed in the scene.


    |Interesting fact:////This is the first Pixar animation that used Global Illumination.////Global Illumination is a way for a
    |imation programs (in Pixar's case, Renderman) to calculate the bounces of light off of surfaces from light sources.////Yes,
    |the FIRST animation they've made that uses GI. Pretty incredible.


        |It looked amazing, but sometimes I found my vision getting blurry from the intense colors they used. But it was amazing
        |none the less.


            |Just knowing how they make it, in my case, makes it that much better and much more to appreciate.


        |They've used similar techniques to GI in previous films which achieve very similar looks, it's just now they're at a pl
        |ce where they have the technology and machine power to 'brute force' and use GI. 


            |Mmhmm. It's pretty easy to fake GI, but it just doesn't have that feeling GI gives you.


                |No absolutely. And there have been improvements to PRman to enable ray tracing and GI. It's not that they were 
                |oing it wrong before, but the projects they worked on were at less of a demand to be photoreal and so rendering
                |savings could be made using REYES techniques for example. Cars was the first pixar film to use ray tracing in s
                |me aspect and they've gone on from there. It's fairly well accepted that ray tracing is the correct way to "do 
                |t". It's just not cheap. 


        |Its also only quite recently that they began using raytraced shadow technology apparently. 


            |Really? Wow, they continue to amaze me.


        |They overhauled their hardware. Their render farm is twice as big as before. They have 2000 12-core servers with 96 GB 
        |f RAM each handling the rendering work. ////All of that for an hour and a half movie.////[Source 1](http://venturebeat.

    |Pretty sure Modeling and Layout are the same but viewed in 'wireframe' and 'hidden' modes. 


        |If you check the source in the comments, they give more detail into what's going on in the pictures.


            |Yeah, but the description for modeling doesn't correspond to that picture. It's just the wireframe from the layout.
            |They aren't even using the final models.


                |As a modeler that's the first thing I noticed. 


                |That bothered me too. I'm not even a modeler, I just picked up Maya out of curiosity for a day.


    |Dang, the second to last one looks like how the original movie was. How far we have come man.


        |Not sure what the exact numbers are, but a teacher at my faculty had some percentage statistics comparing how much did 
        |arious industries advance in the recent period, it's pretty obvious, but no industry (taking 10-50 years) advances as m
        |ch as computer technology does in 24 months... pretty sick

                |Moore's Law refers to the number of transistors doubling. The doubling of performance occurred earlier but more
                |recently increases in performance haven't been linearly correlated with increases in transistors.


                |Ah so that's what it's about, uninformed me, thanks


        |Eh, bit of an overstatement. That image has no real lighting or shadows rendered. I'm pretty sure Monsters Inc had that
        | ////Of course, it's true that we are now able to work with more light sources and different materials that scatter lig
        |t differently, all to make it look more realistic. However, we had a lot of this technology 10 years ago too. CGI movie
        | always render for days, so it's not like there was a lack for processing power when the original movie was made. There
        |have been some improvements in the last year, but they're not even close to how different the last two images look.


        |Yeah looks slightly better than the original Toy Story, still it's pretty impressive.


            |I think you underestimate how Toy Story looked, it didn't look that bad.


                |Well your right, it's not [that bad](http://i.imgur.com/dEIZcOl.jpg) but I re watched the Trilogy recently agai
                | in a long time and the difference is unreal, everyone's so textually smooth with rigid movements. Testament to
                |how much the it has improved and how well your imagination would fill in the gaps on an imperfect technology.


                    |It's mostly the lightly to me. In the past decade, I haven't minded most of the big budget animation/moveme
                    |t.


        |That's what happens when you write your own rendering engines.  


            |can you expand on this?


                |Rendering is to animation as baking is to cooking. The chef puts ingredients together just as artists create mo
                |els/textures/lighting. The chef throws their dish into an oven to bake just as animators send their work to be 
                |endered. It takes hundreds, even thousands, of high powered computers working simultaneously to put those model
                |/textures/lights together into a finished scene. And artists, just like chefs, can't be sure of the quality of 
                |heir finished products until it's finished cooking. ////But rendering is far more complex than applying heat in
                |an oven, and Pixar designed their own rendering software that's very powerful, achieving extremely high quality
                |effects in their renders like motion blur, depth of field, and allowing artists to do more with less, ie allow 
                |he renderer to do more of the heavy detailed work. It's like an oven that dices onions and garnishes the plate 
                |ll while cooking the food.


                    |wow that was a perfect reply. thank you. so Pixar has an inhouse rendering engine? do they have a program f
                    |r all of the production design aspects of it, like designing scenes, camera placement, movement, etc, like 
                    |ource movie maker? importing models and giving them things to do? obviously much more complex but something
                    |similar


                        |Pixar uses Renderman, their own custom render software. 


                        |As far as I'm aware Pixar uses their variant of Maya for sets and cameras etc, and use renderman to ren
                        |er.


                    |/r/bestof


            |Pixar is just a rip off of Disney. I don't see how this isn't talked about more//Edit: guess I should make a puffin

                |Its not talked about because it's completely wrong


                |What do you mean a "rip-off"?  It doesn't "rip-off" anything from Disney.  Both companies just make animated ch

                |Theres literally a bunch of animation studios, and most of Pixar's stuff is very different from Disney's stuff.
                |Actually, most of Disneys movies are ripped off from existing stories


                |Hence the name "Disney Pixar Animation Studios"


                |How so? Are you referring to stories they've used, or animation process or what?////As far as I know, Disney an
                |mation is way different from Pixar's, and I can't think of any Pixar stories that have ripped off Disney storie
                |.. ////Not to mention, many famous Disney movies are simply animated children's version of stories that already
                |existed... so in a way, Disney has been "ripping off" stories (if you wanna call it that).////EDIT: hmm.. it ap

    |As much as I love what Pixar makes, I really want to see a 2D feature put out by them. Between the concept art in their pre
    |production or the closing credits in Wall-E, their 2D artists have a really wonderful style, and I wanna watch them flex th
    |ir muscles a little more.


        |While it isn't made by the actual studio, two of Pixar's art directors are actually working on an animation project rig
        |t now called The Dam Keeper. It isn't finished yet but they have some animation samples up ([here, for instance](http:/
        |vimeo.com/62717022))!


        |Although it's made by Disney, watch [Paperman](http://youtu.be/HSxJkKiHXbw?t=24s)... It's honestly amazing.


            |Just a heads up, Paperman isn't actually 2D animation.//It's lots of crazy rendering tech that lets them make 3D lo
            |k  more like 2D.


                |It's the ['Future of 2D animation'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZJLtujW6FY). It is *technically* 2D.


                    |It's not though... It's 3D made to look 2D. They're saying the future of "2D" is 3D.


                    |No, it's 3D animation with 2D lines laid over flat color.


                        |Ok, whatever you say. I'm really not that bothered by it.


                            |its really 3d though you can tell..


                        |I'm viewing it on a flat 2D display so it is 2D.


            |I've never been able to figure out if that's 2D animation or hyper-stylized 3D. 


                |The hyper-stylized 3D would be more accurate.


                    |Makes sense. The shading style makes it a bit tricky for me.

    |Somehow from the second frame to the last one, Mike went from happy to WHATTHEFUCK


        |He was just tired from the whole animation process which probably took a while


    |The concept art is incredibly cute.


    |As a Berkeley student, I love how a lot of portions of Monsters University are based off real buildings and structures from
    |UC Berkeley.This particular house looks exactly like the Pi Beta Phi sorority house on campus: http://goo.gl/maps/jvRJy


    |It's amazing how Pixar loves making movies. Really, I know that 10 years ago that was the Pixar's golden age but holy crap 
    |hey do make great movies where both kids and adults alike enjoy and somewhat adults gets the message that Pixar is giving t
    | the audience.


    |Do they have to do this with every single frame?


        |No, they can just load models and have it automated to some extent. Movies are 24 frames per second so having this done
        |for every frame would be impossible


        |No. Some steps do need to happen for every shot though (i.e. storyboarding). You may find this comment I posted above i
        |teresting as well:////&gt; In this case for example, those monsters weren't made for just this particular frame. They a
        |e modeled, rigged and textured once, and are then used all across the movie. The same goes for sets and set elements li
        |e buildings, trees, rocks, etc.////&gt; After that it's "just" a "simple" matter of placing the monsters and the enviro
        |ment in the scene, posing the characters by moving their "skeleton bones", adding lights to scene, rendering and finall
        | adding some post-processing effects like depth of field.////&gt; It's therefore hard to give an estimate on the time i
        | takes to build a single frame. Let's say that setting up just this one frame took about an hour (assuming all the mode
        |s were already finished). Now let's also assume they made this into a 3-second shot. 3D animation heavily relies on int
        |rpolation. That means you only have to pose the important frames, the rest get filled in "automagically". If animating 
        |he shot then took an additional hour, the time per frame suddenly comes down to (60m to set up the scene + 60m to anima
        |e = 120m) / (3 second shot * 24fps = 72 frames) = 1^2/3 minutes per frame.


        |Pretty much, at least from steps 3 through 6.  


            |No, animation is keyframed where the animator will set key poses and beats and then the 'tweens' are interpolated b
            | the computer. Lighting involves setting up and tweaking the lights per shot (usually with automated rigs that have
            |been developed to suit a range of conditions like night time, bright sun, cloudy etc) and simulation for fur is a d
            |namic process where the initial conditions (gravity, fur stiffness, scraggle etc) are set up and the artist hits pl
            |y and waits to see what comes back. Nothing in vfx/animation is really done frame by frame except rotoscoping but P
            |xar don't do any of that being completely CG through the pipeline. 


                |I can't say I've worked at Pixar, but even keyframes require nearly constant adjustments, and is "pretty much" 
                |rame by frame. You just can't create a complex, believable set of movements with a handful of keyframes. Yes, t
                |e tweening makes it easier, but it also comes with its own set of challenges.


                    |Completely agree, of all the processes anim probably is the most frame-by-frame. But literally posing every
                    |joint on every frame can lead to stiff animation, it's the skill of the animator to find the balance :)


    |This is pretty similar to most studios, but sometimes these stages are flipped around or combined. For instance, concept us
    |ally comes before or during storyboarding. Concept art is actually coming up with what the character and environments will 
    |ook like, not really what a colored scene will look like. The concept art here is just a color key. Also excluded is render
    |ng and compositing. Still awesome though!


    |DAE feel like they've seen enough animation movies / scenes with the quality of 5th level (in this picture) animation in fu
    |l feature hollywood films? For example, I can't remember the name.. but there's this hollywood film, bunch of animals in ju
    |gle.. not Madagascar; but you can clearly see the lack of finesse. ////edit: Open Season is the film


        |It's all to do with budgets. Not all animation films have $100m to spend. Also is the stylistic choice of the director 
        |ow to present it. Not all animated films want to move towards photorealism, as long as it's coherent.

    |The "modeling" and "layout" process is the same thing.  Someone in 3DS Max hit F3 and switched the view from wireframe to s
    |lid view.


    |I can't even imagine having the persistence of imagination that it must take to get something through all of those stages..
    |I'd be lost trying to just draw the main characters out once, much less create an entire world full of them doing several h
    |ndred things


        |It doesn't quite work that way anyway. Usually, there is a "pipeline", where you work your way through to a finished fi
        |m using artwork and ideas and generally stick to those throughout the process.////It's a bit like an assembly line for 
        |ars, where you have a drawing on the wall of the finished car, to remind you of what you're building.////The advantage 
        |f a pipeline is that you can hire people who are good modelers, but shit animators and the other way around and make th
        |m work on a specific part. People specialize often in a particular area of the pipeline, but it's not a requirement. Yo
        | can also more easily make parts of a pipeline more efficient, without having to change the whole process.////Assuming 
        |hat you have a storyboard and all characters drawn as concept art, you can begin the process:////First you have artists
        | who build assets (characters, backgrounds, vehicles, other objects). These are skilled *modelers*, who know how to bui
        |d a character in a wireframe. You create a character in a neutral T-pose, arms out to the sides and a neutral expressio
        |. Sometimes this process is split in two, where you sculpt these characters like clay models, but still inside the comp
        |ter. But such "computerized clay models" are not useful for animation, so they have to be converted into well-organized
        |wireframe models first, which can be a laborious process.////Then you have *riggers*, who take the character wireframes
        |and basically make them movable by adding a layer of controls (rigging), so you can make facial expressions, moving the
        |arms, fingers, legs, turn the head, etc.////Rigging is more engineering than anything and can be incredibly technical a
        |d complex. Some rigs have hundreds of controls. You need to build the rig, so the character doesn't "break", the knees 
        |on't bend the wrong way and that the wireframe mesh doesn't distort unreasonably, for example, when the character is sm
        |ling.////Some parts contain *physical simulations* as well. For Brave, Merida's hair was part physical simulation and p
        |rt rigging controls, so the animator wouldn't need to excessively spend time animating her hair, but just let the compu
        |er do the work, when needed.////Then you have *animators*, who take the rigged character and move them around in the sc
        |ne according to the storyboard. They're good at making the characters come alive and make them believable, and I imagin
        | that at Pixar, to get this job, you really have to be top notch.////In high-end animation, the process is usually also
        |that voice actors record their characters before the animation process begins, so the animators can use the recordings 
        |o make the performance.////At this point, they can assemble the assets into scenes and play them back, as if it were th
        | real movie, but it's going to look like a Playstation 2 game.////The modelers can also make *textures*. In a Pixar mov
        |e, textures have to be of an extremely high quality, so I imagine that there are texture artists, that don't do much el
        |e, but paint characters all day. I know that recently, for Monsters University, they have made this part of their pipel
        |ne more efficient, making texturing a less technical and more artist friendly effort.////Now comes the technical part o
        | *lighting*. They say in 3D computer graphics that lighting is everything. The textures have to look right under the li
        |hting the director wants. Lighting also affects how hard the scene is to render. Gradually the movie will look more fin
        |shed, so maybe now it looks more like a Playstation 3 game. :-)////For *rendering*, the renderer takes the input wirefr
        |mes as they will be animated, and calculates shaders for skin, surface materials like wood, bricks, metals, dirt, etc.,
        |reflections in mirrors, fog, sky and calculates shadows and lights. Textures are calculated in the finest possible reso
        |ution.////The camera needs to simulate focus, maybe lens flares. When a fast movement occurs, there has to be a blur to
        |look realistic, and that is mathematically calculated as well. Most of this stuff is written by software engineers with
        |scary amounts of math and physics knowledge, and as such, Renderman is one of the world's finest renderers. Rendering i
        | a slow process and can't be played back in real time. You have to wait many hours just to get a single frame in a comp
        |ex scene.////One challenge here is to make the computationally intensive process of rendering take as short a time as p
        |ssible. You want the movie finished in time, but you also want to allow artists to make changes in a reasonable amount 
        |f time, if there is a problem. It's no good to spend many hours rendering a scene, only to learn that the hair color is
        |wrong, or a texture is upside down and you have to render the whole thing over again. The same software engineers as be
        |ore specialize in tuning the renderer to be as fast as possible and to work on many networked computers at the same tim
        |.////Maybe after this, you need color timing and some final composition of overlay texts, effects, etc. that are hard o
        | doesn't make sense to do in the renderer.////So, that's how you can make a CGI animated movie these days.

    |the concept art looks amazing! 


    |I hope you didn't take a picture from the Pixar expo in Amsterdam


        |I've been there, photography was not allowed.


    |The concept art is amazing.


    |Sort of, there was a lot more to each step of the 3d. Like the low poly models were already high poly, but render faster as
    |low poly. 


    |It goes to show you the work that truly goes into the animation..


    |Ughhhh, I want to work either at Pixar or Dreamworks so bad, would be my dream job!


        |Start animating man, it's not impossible


    |Whats the difference between modeling and layout? Looks like layout is just modeling with shading turned on


        |These models are the pre vis models.  Or super quick versions that are just used to get the point across.  The real mod
        |ling process will have much better models with better topology.  


    |I just now noticed the house siding makes it look like a monster too.  The attention to detail in these movies is awesome.


    |There should be a pixar app for cell phones that will create stories and animation based of key words you enter like "broom
    |" or "horses". 


    |Can the concept artists who make the colour scripts just make an entire movie?


    |I think what you have labeled concept is actually a lighting key. Concept, as other people have noted, is coming up with th
    | look of the characters and world, here, that is already established. Lighting keys are a few choice shots throughout seque
    |ces to convey the desired look of the lighting for the final renders, to be done after animation, fx, and cloth, from my ex
    |erience. 


    |Anyone else think they would rather have a blown-up poster of the concept art stage rather than the final thing?


    |The layout one's my favourite, their faces are great.


    |Do they have to do this for every frame?

    |I think DICE did the same thing with battlefield 4 but they only got halfway on the xbox 360.


    |Would anyone else love to see the entire movie in the 'layout' process? Based on this example, I just think that would be h
    |larious.


    |Yeah, computers and skilled people are cool.


    |So does this happen for every frame?


    | so they do this for every single frame?  isn't there a program that renders a set of action?


    |There are some Texas A&amp;M people who work at Pixar, and have influences on character designs. Look at the monster on the

    |This makes me wonder how the CGI process has changed from the Toy Story days to today. I remember I downloaded a collection

    |i don't know why. but i always though that characters in animated movies have an extremely high polygon count


        |Google: 'subdivision surfaces' 


            |no let's guess. during rendering it smooths all the polygons? :D


                |Kinda

    |Il be honest; Iv always thought Sullivan was hot- yeah you heard me


    |what are only some of the 'processes' in small quotes? 


    |Its hard for me to watch cartoons sometimes knowing that every single movement had to be drawn


    |I wish they made the movies also into the "layout process" style plus some animation, I would watch that.


    |awesome


    |No wonder "Finding Nemo2" is taking so long.

    |How big of a group would it take to finalize this entire process?


    |Funny story, a former student of the animation teacher at my high school went on to work at pixar, and he actually got Sull
    | named after the teacher. His name's Mr. Sullivan.


    |A few people have touched base on this idea, but this process is a little incorrect. It's not so much of a linear process a
    | it is an iterative one. A lot of these "steps" overlap. ////Assets are usually design and planned during the story process
    |and iterated through many versions until a final look is approved. Once things are broken into shots and sequences you can 
    |ave an animator and a layout artist working on the same shot with temp assets while modeling is finishing the final version
    |of the model. Even the rigs used to animate are usually never finalized. They are always in flux and always being modified 
    |o suit animation needs. Texturing is usually developed as assets are being designed and modeled because the base textures s
    |ould only need minor tweaks, if any, on a per shot basis. Especially with modern physically based rendering. Lighting can s
    |art while animation is in progress. Also, rendering is rarely the end of the process. Most shots go through some sort of co
    |positing or sweetening before editorial/color.  ////Of course this all depends on what studio is creating the work. ////BUT
    |EITHER WAY, it's always fun to see bts material from Pixar. Good lord they are a talented group of people. ////TLDR: The an
    |mation creation process isn't always linear. 


    |The layout slide is so funny.. They all look like they're performing some sort of religious ritual. ////ALL MUST BOW BEFORE
    |WAZOWSKI


    |And that's for only one frame 


    |Step 5: Decent graphics for a video game.////Step 6: HOLY SHIT!////When are we going to get this kind of lighting tech at h


    |This is why I always appreciate animations. It's a pain stacking loads of work and hoping there's enough hard drive space f
    |r your animations and that your computer should not crash whilst in the middle of animating stuff.////I once was a media st
    |dent and I admit, I was pretty shit at it and failed because I could never do animation, let alone modelling. 


    |I work for a company that designs video games based on Pixar movies, and because it takes us six months to complete the gam
    |s and we need to release when the movies do, I often see the very early rough cuts. It's interesting to see the movies when
    |they have only "temp" dialog (often they use Pixar employees) and mostly pencil sketch storyboards and a few key scenes ren
    |ered. With each progressive version, the story and dialog writing evolve until they're happy, then the animation department
    |works their magic.


    |The "modeling process" and "layout process" are actually the same stage of development, but one is wire-frame view and the 
    |atter is a filled view. Just sayin'.


    |Not trying to be a douche, but I'm a game developer and... it's probably worth pointing out, no additional work was done in
    |between what's labelled here as the 'modelling' and the 'layout' process, the only difference between the two images is tha
    | one is being viewed in 'wireframe' mode and the other in 'shaded' mode. ////It's a toggle in most 3d programs, so while it
    |looks like it would take a lot to get from one to the other, it's usually just one key (for instance, in 3ds max it's the F
    | key). ////I guess most people just associate wireframe with modelling, even though all of the modelling *and* layout was d
    |ne prior to that image being created.


    |As someone who can't so much as draw anything more than stick figures, this is so damn impressive to me.


    |What happened to Mike's smile?


    |He was smiling for a moment.


    |You don't go from layout straight to animation and simulation... The 3d layout characters are very low-poly, and you only u
    |e those for layout, and later you replace them with the real scene and the real characters, which are a lot more dense than
    |the characters in the layout.////So for that Pixar development to be accurate you need a lot more steps in order for it to 
    |e accurate.////Btw, I was trained by people from Pixar making CG films, so I know their workflow quite a bit ;)


    |looks like littlebigplanet


    |You forgot the one where people start throwing bags of money at them.


        |    You forgot the one //    where people start throwing bags //    of money at them.


            |What just happened?


                |/r/thathappened 


    |Hmm, looking at this process, I can't help but compare it to the (still very nascent) Indian animation industry. It seems m
    |st animators in India stop their animation process somewhere between steps 4 and 5 - Layout and Animation/Simulation. ////T
    |en again, the transformation from step 5 to step 6 almost feels like magic... :)


    |I also don't want to be a douche, but the "modeling" and "layout" stages are wrong.  The only difference in your image is t
    |at you've gone from wireframe display to shaded.  Layout is basically taking the models and putting them into the pose.  An
    | you've skipped a difficult-to-display but really important and interesting step called "rigging," which creates controls s
    | that the characters can animate from their default, boring pose, to the poses you see here.//////Lastly, there's nothing p
    |rticularly interesting about Pixar's process, this is every studio's process, pretty much.  There's no special magic Pixar 
    |ses, other than having bigger budgets and (I'm guessing) providing a little more creative freedom.


        |If rigging were to be included though, I feel they'd also have to include other "boring"/ "behind-the-scenes" work like
        |UV unwrapping (alright, Ptex solves this one), texturing, shading, soft-body weighting, etc., which isn't really necess
        |ry to convey the "artistic steps" imho.


        |I don't know what fucking douchebag down-voted you, but you, sir, are right. People just love sensationalism and whoeve
        | made this just wanted to make it seem more complicated than it actually is. (Not that it's not complicated) But yeah, 
        |uck Reddit sometimes.


    |OP, I hate to be that guy, but this is sorta incorrect.  ////The layout, modeling and animation are actually all part of th
    | same development process, just different states of views from within their rendering program.  You could technically hide 
    |he shading they used and still see the wireframes. ////Also, there's a very important step that you skipped which is the sw
    |pping in of high quality models.  This happens around the same time as the animations.  Notice that massive increase betwee
    | the earlier renders and the later ones, especially the amount of hair on Sully's arms.  


    |Layout Process makes it look like they're re-enacting Titanic.


    |Now if they only spent as much time on the story....


        |Was the story not good? I never watched it because I was afraid it would suck since the first one was pretty great.


    |That looks tedious.


    |You forgot the part where they recycle the same shitty narrative over and over again.


    |Pfft, I think FF7 had more polygons.


        |The models you are seeing are low res versions of the actual models to help make it easier to work in the scene. If you
        |were working with the fully detailed models the scene would chug so you use proxies to make things a little more manage
        |ble and then swap them with the actual ones at render time. 


    |for anyone in animation this is a hilarious simplification and also misleading representation of the pipeline...////if only
    |it were that straight forward...
