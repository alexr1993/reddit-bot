I knew it was stormy here in Virginia, but...(/r/WTF?!)




    |My dad and I were fishing in Long Island Sound and a rogue wave came over the boat.  We took on so much water that each wav
    | kept putting more in.  We motored toward a buoy and got to it just in time as the boat sank under us.  We got up on that b
    |oy and it was the creepiest thing ever.  It swayed a bunch and the only sound was the bell ringing and me crying.  About 20
    |minutes later, another boat came by and my dad and I waved it over.  They carried us back to the port where we rented the b
    |at.  Dad lost his $100 deposit.


        |I've never seen buoys as something creepy.  Weird that so many people do.


            |It depends on the context, really. It's the same as a house. It's a house, but you throw in some context and maybe 
            |hange the environment and suddenly it's not just a house, it's a lonely house in a valley, or a house in the ghetto


            |Jaws


        |$100 is not a bad trade off for being alive


            |Heck i'd pay that just to sink a boat.


        |The..... fuck?!?!

        |&gt;It swayed a bunch and the only sound was the bell ringing and me crying ////Wow, that sounded eerie as fuck. Idk, I
        |always feared open waters, Adding the ringing; not gonna lie, even I might cry in that situation.


        |/r/thathappened that $100 though.


            |that boats name? albert einstein


                |lets just say he isnt a virgin anymore ;)


        |What the fuck sort of boat did you rent that sinks after taking a wave!? Unless it was an aluminum lake boat or somethi
        |g, going to call bullshit on this one.


            |The kind of boat you can rent with a $100 deposit. 


            |Rouge waves are waves that are randomly so powerful that it capsizes a lot of ships. Even some modern military ship
            | have problems with it especially it's hard to detect and it comes up too fast to turn the ship towards it.


                |Don't under estimate beautiful, rosy waves.

            |You shouldn't underestimate the ocean in general, but you *really* shouldn't underestimate rogue waves. 


            |I don't think you're aware of the power of a rogue wave. They come out of nowhere and can very easily overpower any
            |ship. Rogue waves 100 feet tall have been recorded. No amount of skill can pull you through a wave like that, only 
            |uck.


    |I remeber an episode of Flipper once the stupid kid was stuck in the ocean and climbed on to one and opened a hatch to seek
    |shelter from a storm.  I always wondered if you could do that in real life.


        |It would be awfully terrifying in there.


            |My god... the sea sickness..


                |Hits me like a wave whenever I put my head down.////Would be a living hell...


                    |would be a killing bell//FTFY


        |I would also like to know


        |I know I'm late here. I work on buoys for a living in the Coast Guard. I haven't seen that episode, but if it's the hat
        |h I'm thinking of, it's a battery pocket. A long tube stacked with basically car batteries paralleled used to power the
        |light atop the buoy. You would have to remove the  batteries which would involve risk of shock or acid burns from leaka
        |e. But you can barely fit in there if it's empty. 


    |I don't know why but I'm terrified of buoys, they're these huge ominous things just floating in the ocean.


        |Surprisingly I came to the comments looking to see if anyone else had an unreasonable fear of buoys as I. Perhaps it's 
        |he fear of whatever it could be chained to, or whatever could be growing on the underside. I also have a strange fear o
        | oil rigs out in the ocean. For some reason knowing that it descends all the way to the bottom really freaks me out.


            |My fear of the ocean has been steadily getting more and more out of hand. Just reading this discussion is edging me
            |close to a panic attack... I can't even bring myself to look at the buoy again!


                |...and then she says, "those aren't bouys!"


                    |"......theyre space stations"


                        |Happy cake day!


                |It's so strange because for me they bring a sense of comfort. The vastness of open water is terribly disconcert
                |ng, and having something that I could cling to makes me feel safer. I'm so sorry that they frighten you guys.//
                |/I will say that anything submerged freaks me out, like the posts of docks or the styroam that keeps some struc
                |ures afloat. That slimy, hairy algae in particular... *shudders* Perhaps that's another reason that I like buoy
                |- they keep me out of the water and away from that stuff.


            |Same... When it's floating, it doesn't really bother me.. But seeing the whole thing like this and I feel a little 
            |neasy, which I feel totally weird saying because it's totally unreasonable.  I think seeing it 1) sparks the realiz
            |tion that something that huge floats on water, instead of seeing water as a "floor" of sorts that it sits on top of
            |.. and 2) that it is chained to the bottom of the seafloor.. which makes me contemplate the sheer vastness and empt
            |ness underneath it.. nothing but a void.. 


                |You sound like you would either love or hate H.P. Lovecraft.


                |Man, it's not a void at all. Their are millions of lifeforms of all sorts drifting around these structures. Yes
                | it's a vast amount of space, but all of it is teeming with life. It is completely foreign to us, yes, but it i
                |n't dead or empty.


                    |&gt;Yes, it's a vast amount of space, but all of it is teeming with life. ////Some of which would love to ~

            |&gt; Surprisingly I came to the comments looking to sea


                |You tried


            |I have no idea about such fears, just want to offer whatever support I can with a stupid Internet comment...


        |And they're chained there. They're attached and somehow that makes everything worse. ////Even little [lake buoys](http:

            |Glad I'm not the only one freaked put by lake buoys. I don't know what it is about them, or buoys in general. I can

        |[deleted]


            |I can confirm that this is true, I'm a buoy.


        |That buoy probably had a 12700lb cement sinker, with an unknown amount of chain (anywhere from under 50 ft, to over 100
        | ft, which is the longest I've seen), the buoy itself probably weighs close to 12,000, lbs, plus all of the growth on t
        |e chain. I'd say anywhere from 20,000 - 30,000lbs, not including sinker. The crane on our boat has a working load limit
        |of 40,000lbs. I've seen it maxed out

        |Yeah....in movies they look barely bigger than a human.


            |In the movies, most of the time a seagull is more than enough to occupy a buoy.


        |This is most likely a channel buoy. Green and red buoys generally indicate where it's safe for a large ship to motor in
        |o and out of a channel. When driving into a harbor, the rule is Red, Right, Returning. This means that when you're retu
        |ning to a harbor, you keep the red buoys on your right, thus ensuring that you're safely in the deep channel.
