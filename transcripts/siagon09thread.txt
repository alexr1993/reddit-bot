TIL that Alec Guinness, the actor who played Obi-wan Kenobi, despised star wars calling it "fairy tale rubbish." Regardless, he was one of the few cast members who believed the film would be a hit and negotiated a deal for 2% of the gross royalties paid to George Lucas. This made him a very rich man(/r/Today I Learned (TIL))




    |'Guinness said in a 1999 interview that it was actually his idea to kill off Obi-Wan, persuading Lucas that it would make h
    |m a stronger character, and that Lucas agreed to the idea. Guinness stated in the interview, "What I didn't tell Lucas was 
    |hat I just couldn't go on speaking those bloody awful, banal lines. I'd had enough of the mumbo jumbo."' ////Hilarious.////

                |Lucas is actually a pretty terrible writer. The general plots of Star Wars is weak and cliche. There are so man

                    |Eh.. the cheese is half of what made the original Star Wars so great.  It was "campy".  It was just "A stor

                |A popular theory about why the first 3 films were so well received and why the second three were roundly trashe
                | is that by the time Lucas made the second trilogy he was no longer a collaborator. He was The Boss, to be obey
                |d unquestioningly. And the films suffered for it. Look at the second trilogy to see Lucas's abilities (or lack

                |Well the script cribbed ideas from the Seven Samurai and my understanding is Harrison Ford ad-libbed a lot of h

                        |i was on TVTropes looking at The Clone Wars entry, and read that Clone Wars was cancelled (which is unf

                    |This does indeed appear to be a problem.  Partly because Lucas micromanaged everything the actors did, part
                    |ally because CGI's requirements heavily constrained the scenes' movement and they had no idea what was supp
                    |sed to be going on and they're like "I guess Lucas knows how this works because I don't".////So like the CG

                    |looking out a window to "reflect" (a reality a greenscreen), and sitting on a couch.  The actors may have f
                    |r better ideas about what their character would do, but the blocking was scripted for CGI purposes.  They d
                    |n't even know what the environment is supposed to look like so they scarcely muster any sort of reaction.//
                    |/But yeah there's behind-the-scenes clips where Lucas is seen micromanaging everything, cuing each actor's 
                    |estures, blocking, expressions and reads.  That's the actors' jobs to execute.  And they're GOOD actors.  S

                    |Mark Hamill doesn't get enough credit. Not many actors can say, "Greetings, Exalted One," and make it work.


                    |I doubt it. I'm a huge Star Wars fan but the writing was never all that great. The writing for the prequels
                    |was just bad enough to make the originals look better by comparison imo.//

                    | is because half the actors changed/improvised and because Lucas wasn't as involved in Empire/Jedi. 


                        |And Marcia Lucas was a genius editor. I bet she managed to cut out a load of really terrible cheese. He

                            |I think more credit goes to Richard Chew and Paul Hirsch. Marica Lucas was working on some Scorsese

                        |The '70s were a great time for film, but I don't think that invalidates the idea that 98% of the movies

            |Well he got 2 percent of the royalties paid out to Lucas. Lucas received one fifth of the box office grosses. I don
            |t know if the rereleases would count, but I assume they do. I also don't know if overseas grosses count. At the hig

                    |I am basing it off the wikipedia article that states//&gt;he negotiated a deal for 2% of the gross royaltie

        |You want to know why the dialogue was better in Ep 4-6, it's because Guinness and Ford fought against Lucas' cheezy dia
        |ogue...Guinness in particular had enough star power and clout (he was already an Oscar Winner), to be able to steer thi
        |gs the way he wanted them to go.////This is why writers start to suck when they get famous. It's because they can ignor
        | their editors and their critics and follow their "vision". Art from adversity, not from ease.


            |To be fair, it depends on the writer. I'm pretty sure Charlie Kaufman knows how to write dialogue better than, say,
            |Jim Carrey.


                |Big gulps, huh? Welp, see you later.


                |But even Charlie Kaufman can disappear up his own ass. ////See also: Synecdoche, New York


                    |Yeah but you get my point. A good writer doesn't need anywhere near as much opposition as a guy with good i
                    |eas but poor execution skills.


                        |Yeah but Jim Carrey improvs and makes a character better than the writer ever could. Case in point: Dum
                        | and Dumber. 


                            |Apples and oranges. I'm not saying Jim Carrey can't make a character better than any writer, but in
                            |some cases it's better for all parties involved if the writer does have control over it, or at leas
                            | the final output. Case in point for Kaufman, Adaptation with Nic Cage. He's fantastic in it, but I
                            |honestly doubt he changed the lines for his performance.


            |Agreed. Lucas and Tim Burton both make complete crap and I think  it's because they don't have anyone running check
            | and balances on them.


                |Dude no offense but could you do what these guys did? Just saying. These guys are def legit in terms of coming

            |All the main cast complained about their lines, Lucas understood that he wasn't great at writing realistic dialogue
            | so he just let them do their own thing :)


            |I'd interpret this to mean that collaboration and compromise and having more than one authoritative voice heard pro
            |uces a better end-product than just one guy calling all the shots. At least so far as George Lucas movies go.


        |It feels like Star Wars has become a cult phenomenon because of everyone except George Lucas.


            |Without Lucas it might not have been nearly as cheesy/campy. I think that has contributed to its status.


            |At the very least, he needs people around him to say no to some of his bad ideas. I think part of the problem with 
            |he prequels is that they gave Lucas absolutely everything he wanted.


                |Yeah there's footage of people seeing the movie the first time it was finished, everyone ahs this look of shock
                |on their face. Afterwards Lucas asks for opinions, and everyone just brown noses.

        |To be fair Star Wars is pretty fucking generic in general. 


        |The more I read about Lucas and the Star Wars franchise it seems the best idea that Lucas had was to hire SMART people

        |Were his lines in Lawrence of Arabia supposed to be any better?

        |I love Sir Alec, but I believe it was Marcia Lucas who came up with the idea to kill off Obi Wan. 


        |So much for the genuine class anagram...


        |Aside from the fact that he's still prominently in the next two films anyway, I thought Obi-Wan's demise was inspired b

        |I don't buy for a second Guinness had a thing to do with his death. If I recall my archetype structure correctly the wi

        |tructure it is pretty unlikely Obi was going to live.

                    | out the Vader role required little *acting*. You always have a mask on, your voice is digitized, all you r
                    |ally do is move, which can be done by a lot of people. In other words, the Vader actor was replaceable, and
                    |he probably knew it, so he took what he was given.


                        |If I recall the issue is that he was promised a portion of the profits, not the gross, so "what he was 
                        |iven" was next to nothing because, thanks to Hollywood Accounting, Star Wars has never made a profit.


                    |Good point.  Keanu gave millions in profit-shares to the effects/costume and crew departments of the Matrix
                    |so they could be "participate" in the success.  Pretty admirable.


                |That's Lucas for you I guess. Star Wars would be absolutely nothing without Darth Vader. He is easily the most 
                |conic character in the franchise and he deserves a chunky ass slice of that star wars dollar.


                    |Darth Vader's voice is the most iconic character on Star Wars.


                        |I wouldn't disagree, but I find it's more a matter of the whole package. David Prowse was the imposing 
                        |igure in the costume, David Earl Jones was the rumbling voice. The costume designers for that franchise
                        |deserve just as much credit as either of them tbh.

                    |ld you notice a difference?


                |Why did Lucas and prose have a falling out?


                    |If I recall correctly, Prowse had a deal where he'd see a % of the film's profits. And due to magical holly
                    |ood accounting, it never made a profit and you can't get a % of 0.


                    |Writer's block?


                |Prowse was paid a wage to which he agreed.  I'm not sure why you think he "deserves" more just because of the r
                |le he played. If he wanted more money, he should have negotiated better, like Guinness. Lucas, nor any of his c
                |-workers, owe him anything.


            |Not true. He did get paid his daily rate, he just never got his percentage. That's the big bucks he's fighting for,
            |but he still received his relative pittance for showing up on set.


    |I can understand him being a bit bitter about getting so much praise from Star Wars. The part he played wasn't very challen
    |ing, in relation to a lot of his other roles. He really poured his heart and soul in some of his performances, and what's t
    |e first movie people praise him for?////Star Wars is a good movie, but not because of his performance. It's just a good sto

            |es, at its core, it avoided ever depending on "magic" as the driving force behind the series. Star Wars did take th
            | easy way out in some sense by explaining everything with "The Force." I can understand Alec's criticism of Star Wa
            |s as "fairy tale rubbish" for that reason.


                |&gt; Star Trek's dialogue is nowhere near as cringe-inducing as Star Wars's.////I'm a huge Star Trek fan, but t

                    |Agreed. I love the show too but we are talking about the series that basically defined 'technobabble'. I ca

                |I think the other difference is that Patrick Stewart hasn't, as far as I can think right now, been in any class
                |cs the way Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge Over River Kwai are. Patrick Stewart's best known for Star Trek (and X
                |Men) which is probably the most intelligent work he's been in next to Shakespearean stage work.////In Alec Guin
                |ess' case, he's being recognized for a lowest common denominator film, which while it speaks to many people, is
                |probably something one can view as reflective of society that more people recognize it than well made historica
                | dramas. Not to mention, as you and other posts indicated, Star Wars is spectacle heavy. Perhaps while no one w
                |uld've done Obi-wan quite as well as Guinness, another could've done a serviceable job in the 'old wizard' type
                |role. ////I'm playing devil's advocate here, so. But, it would be like being Tom Hanks and being, in your twili
                |ht years after your career has peaked, recognized only for Turner and Hooch. 


                    |You're right, Stewart hasn't been in any classic films, but he has always been well regarded in theater.

                |I watched Star Wars recently after many years since my last viewing, and if you actually listen closely to the 
                |ialogue, it's not very good and writers wouldn't get away with it these days even in a family summer blockbuste
                | (of which SW was among the first). When you take a step back and look at the whole story, the arcs and journey
                | etc. then it's a classic, but it really doesn't stand up to closer scrutiny. I suppose that doesn't really mat
                |er, but people like Alec Guinness will care about these things more than the average moviegoer. 


                    |This is true. I hate to admit it, but it's true. The original trilogy may be one of my favorite film series
                    |of all time, but the dialogue is almost cringe-worthy if you look at it objectively from a non-biased persp
                    |ctive.


                |It wasn't developed all that well, but The Force concept was an important part of the film's mythos. From day o
                |e, George described it as a modern "fairy tale", and referred to it as such when pitching the film. It was heav
                |ly inspired by samurai stories, which featured warriors with a strict religious code that connected them to nat
                |re and the forces of life and death. Star Wars also heavily leaned on the writings of Joseph Campbell, a man wh
                | explored myth and fantasy as a vital function of human psychology and culture. George's goal was to create a S
                |turday morning cartoon myth, to guide little ones on their spirit journey. And explosions.////In short, Star Tr
                |k is reality, Star Wars is a dreamscape.


                |One of the problems with Star Wars Episode I is that it suddenly went technobabbling à la Trek in order to expl
                |in the Force through midichlorians. It feels... weird, and never to be heard again


            |He admitted he was only doing it for cash. There's nothing wrong with that. Is everyone supposed to lie when asked 
            |heir opinion? Plenty of actors decry their shitty movies, see the Transformers series. If I act in a performance of
            |Macbeth, I can still say I'm not a big fan of the play. No need for the adoring public to get their panties in a kn
            |t.


            |Where were you in the late 80's, into the 90's? Patrick Stewart most definitely talked shit about Star Trek, especi
            |lly when first cast. He very quickly learned not to talk shit publicly. But he's famously been quoted by castmates 
            |s claiming how he'd put in so many "years in the RSC Theatre to be reduced to this". 


            |It's not an easy comparison to make. Guinness was already a well-established actor when he did Star Wars, and Star 
            |ars was only a very small part of his career.  Stewart was just getting established as a mainstream actor when he w
            |s hired for Star Trek, and he ended up spending the better part of a decade playing Picard.


            |I agree. He was being a dick. And really, as an artist, you should get good vibes from people appreciating any of y
            |ur work, regardless of what you think about it.////I can just see how someone might get bitter about it. It would l
            |ad them down a path to darkness. It's a shame he didn't have some sort of spiritual advisor to mentor him and steer
            |him away from the dark side.


                |Not sure if you made the comment just for the comparison. Either way, I don't think he was being a dick. It's l
                |ke a world-class chef who created amazing new recipies throughout his career and he gets remembered for some ma
                |s-produced microwave meal he gave his name to. People want to be remembered for what they value, not simply the
                |acclaim of the crowd.


            |To be fair though, comparing Star Wars to Star Trek is like comparing CSI: Miami to Sherlock Holmes.


        |He said he regretted taking the role for this reason. He realised that he would be remembered for an unchallenging role
        |in what he saw as a vacuous film.


        |&gt; Star Wars is a good movie, but not because of his performance. It's just a good story.////Star Wars is *popular* m
        |vie. It is epic, fun to watch, and a technical tour de force for its time. But the story is pure formula, a successful 
        |ormula of course, but I don't see anything in the story that makes it stand out.


        |I think it would have been a slightly lesser film without a good classically trained actor playing Obi Wan though. Sure
        |he's not the central character but he's and important part of the whole Hero's journey thing.


        ||what's the first movie people praise him for?////I dunno, Bridge Over the River Kwai?  Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy?  You
        |sound like he didn't exist prior to this silly film.


            |The vast majority of people, especially at the time of Star Wars and from then on, were and are far more likely to 
            |ecognize him as Obi-Wan Kenobi than Colonel Nicholson in *Bridge* or Sherif Fiesel in *Lawrence* or George Smiley i
            | *Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy*. ////I mean, just google the man. In the 10 preview images there are mostly headshots 
            |ut 3 photos of him as Obi-Wan, with only two others being images from other separate works. And in the image sugges
            |ion search the first three suggestions are: "Obi-Wan," "Star Wars," and "Ewan McGregor."

        |The man was an accomplished stage and film actor who prior to Star Wars had already won his best actor Oscar, had a sta
        | on the Hollywood walk of fame, and was knighted.////I think he was more than qualified to pass judgement and such nega
        |ivity is not necessarily snobbish.////


        |Not a snob just a bloody good actor who's talent was well beyond the film and script .////Don't get me wrong I fucking 
        |ove Star Wars but Alec Guinness was a phenomenal actor and a level way beyond everyone else in the film 


            |That's why they needed him. The second most popular actor playing a main character was Harrison Ford, and he was st
            |ll relatively unknown.


                |It was actually Peter Cushing, who played Grand Moff Tarkin who received the 2nd largest salary for Star Wars.


                    |And still the authoritative Holmes in tHotB. 


                |No, the second most popular actor was Peter Cushing at the time SW was cast. Guinness and Cushing were the only
                |"names" associated with Star Wars along with Lucas. Cushing was a popular Hammer Horror film star, and Lucas wa
                | "hot" coming off the extreme financial success of American Graffiti (which Ford had a small scene in, and was 
                |ot a "popular" actor until SW debuted).


                    |That's why I said main character (I know about Peter Cushing in the film, he just had a very small role), a
                    |d relatively unknown. Ford was the only main character other than Guinness who had been in anything notable
                    |up to that point.

                        | still a main character at the time. Remember, he's the one bossing Darth Vader around. Not exactly a "

                            |I'm not trying to have a blindsided internet argument. You're absolutely right. Cushing was essenti

        |Uh... no. Not snobbery. That was an ***accurate*** assessment of Star Wars. The dialogue ***really*** was bad. The movi
        | was all special effects and plagiarized story. It's art was not in the little details, it was in the enormity of it. T

            |*But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!*////Almost everything was bad. The original 
            |dit of Star Wars was atrocious (unseen except for a small room full of industry insiders, one of which I spoke at l
            |ngth with). Hell, the written script was god-awful. If it wasn't for the fact of Ford and Guinness changing their d

            |against the clock to destruction of the rebel base, which was NOT in the original script and convincing George to f

            | would have likely been a huge failure.////I love Star Wars. I'm okay with people pointing out it's flaws. It's utt
            |rly fascinating to me, and few people are really aware of just how close Star Wars was to either a complete failure
            |or cult-classic at best. We really, really came within a RCH of Star Wars not being the classic it became.

            |I wouldn't go so far as to say the story was plagiarized. It was certainly inspired by many other works of fiction.


                |Just like all fiction is.  There's not a story written that didn't incorporate ideas or elements of previous wo
                |ks, that's just how our brains operate.  Except perhaps for Beckett, but I'd hate to live in a world where all 
                |riters were like him.


                    |Awww Beckett is amazing. And so is Ionesco and all the people that write like him. Maybe I'm  just weird. S
                    |ill, Star Wars was more similar in structure to a lot of prior epics than not.


                    |Beckett is still fairly similar in thematic terms (post modern rejection of convention, hope, prevalent abs
                    |rdism etc.) to Eugene O'Neill, Albert Camus, Tom Stoppard, etc.////Obviously they all are fairly distinct f
                    |om one another as well, but I'm just saying I wouldn't say Beckett was the ONLY person tackling the ideas a
                    |d storytelling styles that he did. I'd even say that there's a fair amount of James Joyce in some of his wo
                    |k, so clearly he does derive SOMETHING.


                |Its inspired by 'hero with a thousand faces', a book about how it is actually impossible to write a truly origi

                    |At what point does inspiration turn plagiarism into originality?


                        |When everyone agrees that it's fresh and original, or does something unique.////Look at Avatar: while p
                        |ople don't say "plagiarism" about it, it certainly gets flack for being an unoriginal story, even thoug
                        | on the surface the setting is fairly fresh. 


                |There's certainly a distinction between plagiarized and "hopelessly derivative".  Star Wars' contributions lie 
                |lsewhere, quite far away from the realm of narrative and dialogue.   


                |*Inspired by* is generous. It's about as generous as *plagiarized* is harsh. The truth is somewhere in between.
                |///Star Wars is a collection of scifi tropes, settings, ideas, plastered over a Homeric epic. ////I'm not sayin

                |It was inspired by Joseph Campbell, who studied the similarities between heroic stories across cultures.  Inclu

            |I'll take some of the heat off you and just say that I've always thought all of the Star Wars were pretty mediocre,

        |I don't know, the quoted description seems perfectly consistent with Guinness thinking poorly of Star Wars on the whole
        | That Star Wars was moralistic or a vivid "spectacle" certainly needn't recommend the film in terms of its story, dialo

        |Yes, thank you.

        |Thank you for this. In his autobiography, "My Name Escapes Me," he clearly states that while he didn't understand it co
        |pletely, he was game for it (he was already a very successful stage actor with some quite good film experience, and was
        |hired to add some credence to the cast). ////That last is also why Lucas offered the 2%. Alec wasn't sure it would be a
        |success, but after it was, and until his death, he was always a good sport about replying to all his fan mail personall
        | from the cottage he and his wife shared.


        |well, he had to live up to his own anagram after all


        |Well, it was a paycheck so I doubt he'd sabotage the film by constantly publicly bashing it.  


        |I think it probably had more to do with the fact that they offered to double his original salary offer than the film's 
        |sense of moral good'


        |Sounds to me like he appreciated the good aspects of the movie and rightfully criticized some of its flaws.


        |Peter Cushing had a somewhat similar outlook. He wasn't a personal fan of sci-fi but felt that Star Wars would be an ex
        |ellent movie for kids.


        |So he was a pretentious old fart.


        |A child once told Alec Guinness he loved the film so much, he had seen it several times.  To which Mr. Guinness replied
        | "please stop." Or words to that effect.


            |That child?  Albert Einstein.


        |The kajillion dollars he made off of the film probably went a long way to being able to play the snob.


    |That's how you spot a man of superior intellect.////"This is stupid. Everyone will love it. I want a cut."


        |The british accent makes it cleverer 


    |&gt;Although Guinness disliked the fame that followed work he did not esteem, Lucas and fellow cast members Mark Hamill, Ha
    |rison Ford, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher have spoken highly of his courtesy and professionalism, both on and off the s
    |t. Lucas credited him with inspiring cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to achiev
    |ng completion of the filming.////That's impressive. Classy man.


        |Ford especially stated he learned a lot about how to behave professionally from Guinness. (i.e. know your lines &amp; b
        | prepared, show up on time, how to argue your point without being a "diva", etc)


        |I remember watching a documentary where Hamill talked about having coffee with him at their hotel every day and him bei
        |g a great guy.


        |You don't earn knighthood by mediocrity.


    |He is right though, although Star Wars is very good it is a fairy tale space opera.


        |Entertainment is entertainment. I don't need my life changed every time I walk into a theater. 


            |dude, well said. ////thats why i actually like movies like Avengers and Kick-Ass and The Hangover.////Its entertain

    |My math may be off but if he got royalties for episodes 4-6 only, then he made approx. $35,777,585.02.////That's a huge amo

        |It looks like he got 2% of the 20% of the box office takings that Lucas got. ////&gt; he negotiated a deal for 2% of th

            |Worldwide box was higher (almost $2b for the trilogy), which would give Alec around $7.6m unadjusted - assuming Luc

        |I think he still gets royalties somehow in the deal because Lucas tried to give him a payout to end the arrangement and

    |You gotta view it from his perspective, he was in such major classic flicks like The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of

    | by far. Also consider his age when they shot, he was one of the oldest on set. Peter Cushing and Phil Brown were around Gu
    |nness's age, but it might have been hard to relate with them on the film.////Cushing was in loads of fantasy horror stuff w

            |Well i'm glad you were here to clear that one up for us.


    |People might misinterpret this a bit. To be clear, Guinness got 2% of the 20% Lucas got, so he got 0.4% of the gross. This 
    |s still a lot of money.


    |Here is an interview he did at the time about it. http://youtu.be/2nSKf5qhDy8?t=28m15s////Basically he thought when he rece
    |ved the script that the dialog was crap, but that the story was compelling.


    |He wasn't the only one who hated the movie. Harrison Ford also despised it, and apparently there was a time (soon after Blu
    | Runner) when you couldn't mention Star Wars to Ford's face without getting yelled at. Guinness needed the money, and Lucas
    |needed an actual star so he agreed to allow Guinness to get the 2% in exchange for his acting. I don't believe that Guinnes
    | actually got paid a salary while on set. I know for a fact that Guinness never learned anyone's name except for Lucas' and
    |when he saw Blade Runner he had no idea that Harrison Ford was the same guy from Star Wars until somebody told him


        |So does Ford not hate it anymore? I mean he asked Disney to be in the new one, and I doubt he really needs the money at
        |this point. 


    |He's also the only Star Wars actor to receive an Oscar nomination for his work in the saga.


    |Fairy tale rubbish isn't so bad. Lord of The Rings and Harry Potter could be considered fairy tale rubbish by some people, 
    |nd they're still written well, enjoyable to watch, and have caused a huge impact on culture.


    |I know this is bad form on reddit, but I'm kind of with this guy. Star Wars had cool special effects and stuff, but I reall
    | just do not understand the outrageous appeal it has to people. I feel the same way about Harry Potter and Star Trek. Possi
    |le that I just have a criminal hatred of happiness.


        |I think Star Wars is the biggest nostalgia film of all time because it exposed kids to a science fiction universe never
        |before seen on film. I used to absolutely crave watching them as a child because they were so cool. I watched some of A
        |H the other day and was moderately shocked how some of the dialogue is...bad. I still enjoyed it, but I think, at the e
        |d of the day, it's a nostalgic film for an incredible amount of people.


            |Except it is not really sci-fi... It is far more fantasy than any science fiction. Same with movies like Avatar bei
            |g called sci-fi. At least Star Trek is a bit more sci-fi, but still fantasy over all.////I probably have a way too 
            |arrow of sci-fi though, as I tend to only enjoy extremely hard sci-fi.


                |It's certainly not hard sci-fi, but it's set in a futuristic society, deals with robots, space travel, and its 
                |antastical elements are depicted as having a broadly scientific basis.


            |The biggest thing for me is how bad the light saber fighting is in episodes 4-6. The prequels had all kinds of acro
            |atics and light sabers flashing around cutting all kinds of shit up. People got maimed, beheaded, run through, etc.
            |in all three of episodes 1-3. Limbs are literally flying to and fro. The final duel in ROTJ looks like two people w
            |o don't know what they are doing swinging shovels at each other in comparison. 


        |Well purely from an film point of view, Star Wars was significant.////From my film textbook:////   The phenomenon of St
        |r Wars is significant in the history of both film and the arts in general. In film, it marks the beginning of a neoclas
        |ic phase. Neoclassicism, denoting a return to and reinterpretation of the traditions of an earlier classical period, is
        |common to all art forms. When Star Wars appeared, sound film was exactly fifty years old. Within this relatively short 
        |ime span, film developed a golden age, rejected those traditions, and returned to them. Such is the accelerated pace of
        |twentieth-century life and twentieth-century popular entertainment. Star Wars embraces the traditions of the past and u
        |abashedly adopts cliches from westerns, medieval action/romances, martial arts films, and romantic comedies. These borr
        |wings do not diminish the work, as the strands are woven into a brilliant new tapestry.////   Star Wars also stands at 
        |he onset of a general trend in the arts to return to the emotional qualities of romanticism. The arts of the 1950s thro
        |gh the 1970s generally were dominated by intellectual structures; emotions were mistrusted. Beginning in the late 1970s
        | a significant number of composers, artists, and writers sought to endow their works with greater emotional content. Th
        | link to traditional romanticism in Star Wars is apparent in the first line: "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away
        |" The fascination with our mysterious past is one of the standard themes of romanticism. Thereafter, the audience is in
        |ndated with sights and sounds - both music and sound effects - created to stimulate an emotional response. The sensatio
        |al financial success of this film opened the door for other filmmakers and artists to follow suit.////   The music of S
        |ar Wars returns to the some of the basic features of the classical film score: use of a symphony orchestra, a postroman
        |ic musical style, wall-to-wall scoring, support for the drama, and unity through leitmotifs and thematic transformation
        | John Williams avoids employing a theme song or any reference to popular music, other than the saloon music on Tatooine
        | He writes for the traditional symphony orchestra in a standard yet colorful manner; the strings are used for the lyric
        |qualities, the brass for their power, and the woodwinds for their individual colors.////   As in scores from the classi
        | age, music underlies and supports much of the drama. Physical gestures are often mirrored, source music accompanies th
        | saloon scene, and the many varied emotional states - love, concern, and triumph - are projected in the underscoring. I
        |  the dramatic fighting scenes, characteristics of Korngold's great adventure scores can be heard, including hard accen
        |s, syncopation, loud dynamics, and occasional thematic references. In these sequences, music often coordinates with sou
        |d effects. Sometimes, the sounds are so compelling - for example, the pulsating light sabers - that music is not necess
        |ry. In  the climactic attack on the Death Star, music accompanies the early stages of the battle. Eventually, the music
        |subsides, leaving just sound effect. This absence of music allows Williams to pinpoint the imminence of the climactic m
        |ment by having the music reenter with a horn call just before the last, desperate run at the Death Star.


        |&gt;cool special effects and stuff////You put Star Trek in there, but a lot of it is actually relatively smart. Star Tr
        |k is not a show about laser beams in space.


        |I agree with Star Wars and Harry Potter, but not Star Trek.////I've only ever really watched TNG, but the thing I love 
        |bout it is that it's *true* scifi. It's all about delving in to the philosophical impacts and consequences that come wi
        |h advanced technology. It's ultimately a show about humanity, and that's what I think makes it truly stunning.

        |Exactly, I read the article then came here to say this. He's an arrogant jerk.


            |I can see where he's coming from. He performed better in better roles in better films, a few of them at the time an
            | even now regarded as some of the best films ever made, and he was widely known by many for *only* a fairly standar
            | role in a bottom-denominator movie. Guinness himself saw the good-hearted nature in Star Wars, but he grew to hate
            |the idea that something so lacking in depth would define him to the masses and it made him bitter. 


        |Good for him, most hardcore star wars fans are barely socially aware, it probably rocked their world view and maybe som
        | of them grew up a little bit as a result.


            |Yea, that has nothing to do with starwars. geeks geek out on shit. If star wars wasnt created, it'd be harry potter

            |exactly. Imagine if you were in this position. You're an Academy award winning, multiple nominated shakespearean ac
