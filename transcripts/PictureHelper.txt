    |This tame bear is often called a "dancing bear".  They are taken from the wild, beaten and mutilated in order to be "traine
    |".  They are then marketed as tourist attractions.  This practice still exists in Siberia and India.////For some more infor
    |ation, here is a write up from the World Society for the Protection of animals: //http://www.wspa.org.au/wspaswork/bears/da
    |cingbears/lifeofadancingbear.aspx////International Animal Rescue: //http://www.internationalanimalrescue.org/projects/9/Bea

    |ing-bears-stopping-the-exploitation/////Sorry to be a downer, but **just because it's cute, doesn't mean it's moral**.////


        |That might be true.  But if you watch the source video you can see the guy is giving the bear treats. Like training a d
        |g. And you can also see the bear is running free and its not in chains. It could easily run away or rip this guy apart 
        |f it wanted to. http://zasmejsa.com/videa/zobrazit/62981/v-tom-rusku-je-mozne-asi-naozaj-vsetko/


            |I must admit that looks like perfectly legit animal training. The treats are the main reason. Also the bear and the
            |dog seem perfectly relaxed and happy, and I doubt the bear would come galloping over like it did if it had been mis
            |reated.


            |While it's possible the bear was trained ethically, often the remove the rope from their snouts and the physical ba
            |riers after the animal has been "broken". 


                |all trained animals are beaten


                    |Yes, I remember beating my dog horribly to teach it "gimme paw"


                    |Brb. Calling the local news to tell them about the miraculous phenomenon that is my dog. I don't hit him AN
                    | he doesn't shit in the house anymore!


            |Don't know about this bear, but I believe many of these circus bears are (heavily) medicated to keep them docile. (
            |o lazy to find a source)


        |Thank you. It's fucking horrifying. //


            |Don't know why people downvoted you. I agree at least. Teaching a bear to hula hoop for entertainment is fucking ho
            |rific.


        |I have to agree with this.  Im all for eating meat and what not but torturing a wild animal just to teach it this crap 
        |ust doesn't seem right.  


        |I completely agree. Bears **are not** made to hula hoop. Especially for human 'entertainment'. I think it's disgusting 
        |hat people make jokes and find it entertaining. It's like gawking and making jokes about the 'Elephant Man' because he'
        | 'different' and 'hideous' and not thinking about the human being behind it and the pain he went through. ////Some peop
        |e can be so ignorant.


        |That's exactly what I was thinking. You wouldn't think it was so funny if you had seen the 'training' inflicted on the 
        |ear to make it do that.


        |I don't care about moral. It's interesting.////Go be a vegan pussy somewhere else


            |Why would you bother replying to my post?


                |Don't feed the troll


    |how did that chair hold 600 pounds? 


        |I thought exactly the same


            |Made by Americans for Americans. and bears


        |damn Africans stop using pounds when the rest of the world uses metric system!

    |Absolutely the largest gopher I have ever seen.


    |It was a...................... bear hug


    |He just did something on my bucket list...hug a bear 


    |TIL that a bear can hula hoop way better than I can ever hope. 


        |Dude it will literally only take you a day to get pretty good at it. Source: I spent an entire afternoon of my life goi
        |g from instant drops to maintaining a hula for 30sec+. Haven't done it since.


    |Exactly what I imagine a bear in a hula hoop and gum chewing competition would look like.
