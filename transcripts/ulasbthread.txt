        |Photography!


        |wow, really discredits the whole idea of OP's. good job. photo wars, round one. 


            |I think it's the opposite. I clearly shows that OP got the better composition, and hence, picture. 


    |too bad someone went overboard with the vignette


        |I cant even tell what I'm looking at


    |got a devil's punchbowl.  //on my head.


        |in my mind


    |I rotated the pic a few times.  It looks pretty sweet no matter the degree of  angle though


        |You took this pic? what gear did you use?//


            |No... I think he means he rotated it with a picture editing program.


                |or he turned his damn phone around


                    |or his head.


    |Where in NZ?


        |Arthur's Pass in the south island.


        |Arthur's Pass, been there a couple of times, only a 30 min walk from the settlement.////[Google maps link](http://goo.g
        |/maps/CWSz5)


            |One of the most beautiful things I have ever seen is on the flat there where it gets very broad, with about half a 
            |etre of fresh snow from the night before. I have traveled the world extensively off the beaten track and still that
            |one scene to me was/is just so surreal.////Also the Homer tunnel is very impressive.


            |Not far from one of [the best places I've camped](http://goo.gl/maps/or9Vk)


        |As others have said, Arthur's Pass. It's the main pass between the East and West coasts, and if you're ever in NZ and g
        |ing to the West Coast straight from Christchurch chances are you drove over it. Nearly all the main alpine passes in th
        | South Island have the beech forest that you see here (exception being Lindis Pass, which is alpine tussock). Haast Pas
        | (down at the bottom of the West Coast plain as you head inland towards Wanaka and Queenstown) is of particular mention
        | as you've got the [Gates of Haast](http://www.lynx-travel.com/Vacations/NZ2000/Wanaka/Gates%20Of%20Haast%20Bridge%20Ov
        |r%20Haast%20Gorge.jpg) - a fairly large set of rapids down the Haast River that's violent even at the best of times, as
        |well as several other waterfalls. As a matter of course, any of the mountain passes between the East and West coasts is
        |going to have waterfalls and beech forests like Arthur's and Haast, and almost all of them have short walks you can go 
        |n (Devil's Punchbowl is about 20-30 minutes depending on ability) that make it easy to forget you're just off a major S
        |ate Highway. 


            |Most would take the Lewis pass to stop off in Hamner on way to the coast//


        |Devil's Punchbowl.


    |NZ Rep!


    |Looks like a Zen painting. Beautiful.


    |I was at a Devil's Punchbowl today, in Oregon!  Also beautiful, though not as devil-y as this one.


        |So you didn't get in the water, then...


        |Hamilton here!


        |That's the one I think of.  I wonder how many punchbowls the devil really needs, y'know?


    |Oh wow - Front Page? Thanks guys! When I first saw this image earlier today I had a feeling sharing it would be the right t
    |ing to do ;) I am glad you guys enjoyed it too.


    |This is a real place? I'm officially impressed. Thanks for sharing.//


    |i am almost embarrassed by how much time i spent tilting looking at this picture. and by how long it took me to figure out 
    |ow to spell embarrassed


    |It looks like Reach from the Halo universe 


        |Reminded me of Donkey Kong Country 3.


    |When I look at the water all I see are ghostly looking silhouettes. 


    |This is fucking gorgeous. And kind of mind-blowing. As I do not know what I am looking at. Still awesome.


    |I want a treehouse right there... the sound of rushing water all day everyday...


        |Does your treehouse have a bathroom?


    |Seems like the devil gets the coolest places.//


    |That is a stunning photo! Love the way mountain beeches look in Autumn! It's a great hike there as well!


    |Gotta be south island..


    |Whoa I've been there but it didn't look like that at all!


    |These are all real photos right? Like no photoshop?


    |Step one: use all the filters//Step two: ???//Step three: karma


    |If you stare at it for a while, it looks like the water is moving 


    |Aww, your devil's punchbowl is cooler than my devil's punchbowl.


    |Have been there. It looks a whole lot more impressive in that photo than IRL :)


    |I must know where this is! To google maps, if I can't find it,//Help!//I must go there and find this place, please tell me 
    |here!


    |Rainymood, jazz with a GIF. file of this. I could die by the screen.


    |The New Zealand pics are just astounding on a regular basis.  I'm starting to think they are disqualified from Earthporn be
    |ause it has to be a different planet!


    |Holy shit, for a second I thought was in /r/imaginary landscapes. That's beautiful.


    |That's one dedicated OP, the steps to get to the devil's punchbowl are a killer.


    |AKA Rivendell


        |Actually, I believe Rivendell was located in Kaitoke Valley. 


            |And all that's left is a sign saying it was there. 


    |Can we rename it Gandalf's punchbowl?


    |i punched ur momz bowl


    |I fucking hate nj
