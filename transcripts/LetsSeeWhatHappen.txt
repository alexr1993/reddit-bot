Loading....(/r/funny)




    |I want to know why the fuck I can let the video load most of the way, then I skip forward a little bit, still in the preloa
    |ed section mind you, and it has to start loading all over again. That's what pisses me off the most.


        |DASH play, it's a feature. Youtube decided at some point that it is smarter and easier to send every video in multiple 
        |hunks that aren't loaded until they're needed, rather than sending the video and letting the fucking player deal with s
        |eking. Get the enhancement thingy mentioned earlier, turn off DASH play, and you'll like Youtube again (until they fuck
        |it up more).


            |I'm going to have to get that plugin (in addition to the one I already have that sets the highest quality available
            |. Why would I want to watch a video in 240 when it's available in 720/1080?


                |&gt;Why would I want to watch a video in 240 when it's available in 720/1080?////If you're like me and your apa
                |tment has wifi too slow to load high quality videos.


                    |Get better wifi.


                |YTC also has the auto quality setting, along with downloading, "cinema mode" to dim the lights, a continuous re
                |lay feature, hugely customizable page layouts i.e  make the video automatically be large and centered etc.////I
                |'s a really great addon and it's all integrated in a nice visually unobtrusive bar under the video you are watc
                |ing.


                |Somebody's never dealt with data caps. :(


            |is the option to turn off dash play in the settings?


                |Yes, of that youtube enhancement center - should be a little cog icon next to your login name in the corner. 


            |You are a god among men.


            |Actually it is smart and easier for the server/bandwidth.////I realise that people with a slow internet hate this f
            |ature, but if you have the speed, it is actually faster.//Personally I would love a hybrid of both.////Befor people
            |cry about youtube, they should realise that there is a reason why everyone is using it, not only do they permanentl
            | integrate great new features, but are also able to provide the service without downtimes/lags/problems. Just think
            |about how big and demanding youtube really is..////Now if they could fix the subscription categories getting delete
            | if you move to the new account system, that would be great..


                |DASH play is a DRM powerplay and that's about it. They (being big content, the MPAAs and such) don't want peopl
                | to easily acquire video files, so now they don't let you have the whole file at once. ////It doesn't make any 
                |ense at all to discard downloaded data in favor of downloading new data from further in the stream. Further, it
                |doesn't make any sense to wait til the user seeks to start downloading later data.////If they wanted to make it
                |work better AND with sense, they'd download the video in chunks, but start every chunk when the player opens. D
                |wnload it torrent style for speed. All they're doing with this implementation of dash play is sending people ba
                |k to the dialup age of Youtube. 


        |It changes the quality when you skip, and then immediately deletes everything you loaded and starts reloading.


            |What, really? And who the thought that would be a good feature?


                |Probably the same guy who thought most of Youtube's new features were "good".


                    |Would you like to start using your real name on the internet?////[ ] Yes////[ ] Yes, please.////[ ] Ask me 
                    |gain 30 seconds from now.


                        |Is it okay if I give you my real fake name?


                    |Didn't know Google had hired Zuckerberg. 


                    |Why can't we go back to the 2007 YouTube when Nigahiga was actually funny?


                        |Or the old YouTube layout that worked on every browser in existence.


                |Fucking Tom.


                    |I'm sorry ;_;


                        |Yeah, well you should be.


                    |isn't Tom the dude from myspace? my only friend there


                    |Chad had a part in this. Fuck Chad. And Tom.


                        |:(


                            |Fuck you chad


                |Even better is if you rewind what you just watched....on the highest quality and it has to reload.////Or often 
                |f I go fullscreen too quickly it just won't load until I get out off full-screen, at which point I can put it b
                |ck on.


                |No clue. You can set your auto quality the same as the quality you want and it stops it from happening in most 
                |ids, but going fullscreen seems to screw it up.


                |Youtubes quick to change their fucking layout every other month but they won't fix how their videos are loaded 
                |o it's actually more convenient. 


                |If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say YouTube. 


                |Thats exactly my question, what do they gain financially by doing this?


                    |I can give some insight on some of the changes at least.////"Dash loading", this is good because if someone
                    |loads a video then doesn't watch it, the full video doesn't load from youtubes servers. 2/3 less server loa
                    |.. over hundreds of millions of users.. that's a shit load of saved resources. They could reduce their serv
                    |r infrastructure dramatically if the data is predictable enough that they know for sure the demand will rem
                    |in low.////"Resolution being automatically set to lowest", exact same idea. Loading a low res video is a lo
                    | less information being sent over the network than a 1080p video. The less information they are sending, th
                    | more people they can serve with faster responses and load times.. and it's cheaper for them.////Not sure a
                    |out why it resets loading if you select a new location to view. As others have said it's because the qualit
                    | is being changed, so I guess it's just a trick to get people to keep watching lower quality videos.. but t
                    |is one seems particularly shitty.////Overall it's just Youtube getting greedy. They have seen how popular t
                    |ey got and now they are trying to optimize that popularity so they need the least resources to serve the mo
                    |t people. What are you gonna do? Stop watching youtube?////////


                |The execs that told them to save as many pennies as possible. Same reason it has a blank white background, save
                | bandwidth. 


        |You can download some add on from top commend above and disable the Dash feature which reverse back to the old loading 
        |unction


        |This app works great and available for most browsers. //https://github.com/YePpHa/YouTubeCenter/wiki


        |Cause flash is terrible. If I click on a video and it runs in flash, I just close it, it's not worth it. HTML5 works 10
        |x better.


    |I highly recommend the [Youtube Center](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/youtube-center/) add on. It lets you
    |change back a lot of the stupid shit Youtube has done, such as letting the video load when you pause it.


        |My videos still randomly stop buffering even with this addon. Usually at the 50% mark.


            |You have to go into the YouTube Center settings, player tab, and make sure the DASH box is unchecked. If you haven'
            | done that, videos will load like normal. ////http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1mfx6l/after_submittin

                |al videos they wouldn't play until I re-enabled DASH. Disabled it again, a few more videos played, then stopped

                    |No, I haven't experienced that.

                    |Are you sure? Every video I open automatically plays 720p, and I can switch to 480p without a problem. I ca
                    | switch to 1080p without a problem, too, but I don't have a 1080p screen, so I can't verify that it actuall
                    | is playing in 1080p.


                        |Him. Do you had auto resolution enabled?


                            |Yeah, it's set to 720p.


                                |Weird. What version do you have installed?


                        |Set it to 1080p anyway. It increases more than just the resolution, bit rate is also increased, so it'l

                            |It also increases bandwidth consumption and loading time.

                |That second sad chuckle always gets me.


        |I should note that the first thing everyone needs to do is go through every tab (the embed player and the regular playe
        |, and I think there might be another one) and disable "Dash Playback". This is what causes the video to lose everything
        |you loaded when you decide to skip to a different part of the video. Youtube is glorious once you disable Dash.////I al
        |o recommend forcing the player from Flash to HTML5 for every video.


            |Many people including myself have had big problems with the HTML5 trial that everyone was automatically opted into 
            |uch as the volume controls not working and not being able to go full-screen on an embedded clip like those in a red

                |I used to have those issues. Have you tried it recently? It's flawless for me now. 


                |Yeah, HTML5 forces the browser to go to full screen.

            |Whenever I disable that.  It limits playback to 720p maximum.


            |I don't know what these words mean! Tell me! Please. :)


        |Wow. This is actually a very good addon. Thank you very much!


        |Nowadays I always download youtube videos with greasemonkey scripts. It's just faster, no buffering shit, no messing ar
        |und with quality settings, no adds, I can skip to where I want. Plus with VLC you can start playing the video before it

            |Plus they just don't get it. After every update it restarts and asks you again.

            |Is that the dad from Lizzie McGuire?


            |What does that have to do with anything?


        |I  think it's a plot to make us suffer and pine for the old days when it worked well enough, and in the process break d
        |wn our will and get us to pay for membership that delivers the old functionality that we used to get for free.


            |I have a theory like this about Spotify.  They make the commercials for the free accounts extremely obnoxious so pe
            |ple will upgrade to the premium account.////Although there actually are some pretty good benefits with the premium 
            |ccount other than no commercials.


                |Honestly the only thing keeping me from getting a spotify membership is a general lack of popular music when co
                |pared to pandora.  This means that I generally only use spotify when I'm looking for a specific song to listen 
                |o.


                |I've had premium the entire time I've had spotify. Absolutely love it. Kicks the shit out of damn near everythi
                |g. 


            |I'm intrigued. Can it really be that brilliantly evil. I'd pay. I really would. 


                |I wouldn't.  Because I guarantee some other site will come along and just start doing it for free.


                    |But, it wouldn't be as good and you'd have to wait for it... Then again, in a few years, ok, you might win.


        |YouTube (Google) doesn't want to pay for all that wasted bandwidth people use when they load a video but never watch th
        | video. So they don't let the video load unless you are playing it.


            |So why then, do they throw away the buffered content when you click to go back or forward to already loaded parts?


            |Tough shit for everyone that doesn't have first world internet then.


            |Also they've stopped reloading the video when you select a new quality, they just load the missing part at new qual
            |ty leaving the part already loaded in the old quality. Which means when you want to watch a short video in 1080p yo
            | have to be fast and select 1080p before it loads in 360p (or restart it later).


            |I see. Well, that would all be well and good as long as they'd actually load the video that I'm "playing"...


            |Makes so much more sense to re-buffer the whole video whenever you rewind it.


        |PepperFlash


            |Ah, thanks, did not know this.


        |* Ads are everywhere.//* The videos won't pre-load completely.//* The videos won't stay in your cache so you have to re

        |Take off the rose tinted glasses and it stars working perfectly again.


        |I personally haven't had any loading issues and I have bad internet. Also if you look back on previous versions of the

    |How about when you full screen it, and the loading process starts all over.


        |Thats because you have it on auto quality, fullscreen usually makes it go up a bit so it has to start again

    |Since approx. 6 months youtube videos don't work well for me. After 2 seconds the video restarts, then restarts, then resta

    |This gif forgot the pause that happens after the first two seconds.
