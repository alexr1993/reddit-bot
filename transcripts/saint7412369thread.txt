    |That hammock isn't going to stop a blaring ambulance or police car.


        |but then theyd need another ambulance though and itd be a pain to get there


            |Maybe the first ambulance could pick him up on the way back?////*amber lamps


                |Correct. It is spelled "amber lamps," although "amberlamps" is generally accepted.


                    |What are amber lamps?

                        |Whoa black betty.


            |Heh... *Pain*


        |I wonder how fast they are. They can be heard from quite a range, but at what speed will they really push through that 
        |ather slim lane? From what I see there are a lot of people in the back who will have to move stuff, so changes are that
        |they are gonna take a while to reach their destination. Might be enough time to remove the hammock and get to safety.//
        |/It's a dickmove nonetheless.//


        |Not with that attitude


            |That makes no sense. 


                |Not with that attitude. 


                |But it is an easy, stale, generally accepted quip. ////You find a lot of these around here. Just look at your o
                |n response.


                |That's what she said.


        |you bet it is. Not from them hitting it, from them saying "what the fuck is that oddly shaped thing in front of the amb
        |lance with a guy in it" and hitting the brakes. Life isn't an action movie 


    |Oh man, wasn't expecting a picture of the HRBT on the front page. This particular stretch of road is the bane of my existen
    |e due to these kinds of backups. The two lanes going under the harbor itself somehow spook people, causing congestion for m
    |les which makes goings slow, but at least it moves. Get an accident in the damn thing, however, and you'll be in a situatio
    | similar to what is depicted. Stationary for anywhere from thirty minutes to hours.


        |It also doesn't help that people feel the initial down hill stretch and don't think they have to accelerate through the
        |rest of the tunnel. Now you have people going in the middle going 30 mph for no reason at all.


        |Wait, this is in Hampton? I didn't expect that either. 


        |Same here. The HRBT is the [Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Roads_Bridge%E2%80%93Tunn
        |l). It connects Norfolk, VA with Hampton, VA. I drive it every day and it's a nightmare at times. 100,000 people a day 
        |uring tourist seasons squeeze through there. 


    |Leave it to the Subaru owner to have a camping hammock at the ready. Once again, leave it to the Subaru owner to stand up t
    | the service lane using ass holes.

    |There actually is a shoulder on the right hand side large enough for an emergency vehicle. Source: I live in Virginia Beach

    |Just a little levity here I think. OP clearly has time to undo the hammock in case of emergency. Between them, he and the p
    |otographer could see anyone approaching.


    |You can tell by the Subaru that this guy's a dick.

    |The lane was already blocked by the countless cars with their doors open parked too close to the barrier to fit an ambulanc
    | through anyways.


        |Other people doing slightly shitty things doesn't make you less of a dick for doing more shitty things.


            |But trying to hopelessly improve the shitty situation *does* make you a better person, despite it is hopelessness.


            |If the point is moot to begin with, why the fuck does it matter?////Also, if he hears an ambulance coming, he can j
            |st get up and move. It's that simple.////Furthermore, an ambulance and other vehicles would be coming from the othe
            | direction that isn't completely blocked. That's a shoulder, not an "emergency lane". Some shoulders are inconsiste
            |t in width (that one isn't wide enough for an ambulance), or taper off. They're mostly there for broken-down vehicl


                |I don't agree that a moot point doesn't matter in principle.////But I do agree that in this specific scenario, 
                |hich is all that matters... in this conversation...in this thread... about this post... yes, it doesn't mean a

        |Why does that matter?  Is being stopped ten feet further up the road going to help matters?  If anything, having some n

        |People being too close together is why traffic jams happen in the first place. Someone is trying to merge into a lane w

        |doing the same thing in the other lanes.
