The best recovery I've ever come up with.(/r/The Memeing of Life.)




    |Since people actually liked this I'll go into a little more detail. I got dragged to a party by a couple of my buddies, was
    |just planning on drinking some beers and hanging out. Went out to smoke and there was cute girl standing by the door where 
    | was going. I say hello to her and pull out my light, and at exactly that moment the ground kind of slid out from under my 
    |eet and my ass made contact with the ground. Figured I'd already lost any chance of getting her interest, so I just blurted
    |out the first bullshit thing that came to mind. Turns out she's the best kind of girl and actually found it funny, she just
    |said "Nice save!" when I stood up and it went from there. It went from a rough night to a great night just like that. 


        |did u guys do it


            |Honestly, no. I'd already had a good bit to drink, and drunk sex is just something I can't bring myself to do. But 
            |ince you asked, hell yeah I touched her butt and I got her number too so I plan on touching it again. And again. An
            | maybe even again after that.

    |Ahhh this post brings me a fond memory. I live close to work, so I cycle in often. There was construction going on so the b

    |alk up onto a mound to go around them, only to come back down into 2 feet of sand. Front tire sank, I ate so much shit, bik
    | in the air, me in a cloud of dust. They jog over to help but before they could get to me I pop right up and yell "YOU GUYS
    |ALRIGHT?" They were confused for a second, then they laughed and I enjoyed me sand breakfast. Good times.

        |I'd think it's creepy as fuck, honestly.  It's implying he's fallen in love with her.


            |It was clearly a joke though. If he were serious it'd be creepy.


                |Yeah, but it's a creepy joke.


            |Dude, it's just supposed to get a chuckle. Nobody would actually think he was in love with her


                |It still comes across as really creepy to me.


                    |Well to each their own. It's just a little witty recovery, but if that doesn't work for you, no big deal.

    |We recently shot a trailer for a little zombie flick. Our "main zombie" for this clip had to eat off the chest of an attrac

    |anything that cool to say in the heat of the moment if I were in his position. 


    |&gt; She actually did surprisingly. Helped brush the dirt off my pants and then we just talked for a while.////Yeah... you 
    |on't just go from that to touching butts. :\//Unless you're some kind of butt toucher. 


    |This one time i slipped walking up to a girl in a truck(subcontracter new to the jobsite i had to go meet). As i got closer
    |to the truck I realized she was kinda nerdy and cute with some sweet glasses. The mud on the slope she was parked on got th

    | had recovered. Unfortunately all she knew was that I came up to her truck and just said, "Whoooooooaaa!" Just before she s
    |w me... It was more awkward then just having her watch me fall.
