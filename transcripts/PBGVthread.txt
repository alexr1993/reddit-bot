In Mumbai. The boy with the stripes was so excited when I said yes to taking his photo, that he ran and grabbed his best buddy to join in on the fun.(/r//r/Pics)




    |Hi - I've noticed lots of people asking if they wanted money.  Nope.  It was really a spontaneous moment.  The kids were pl
    |ying and this little boy noticed my camera and asked for a photo.  Afterwards they enjoyed a few moments looking at the pho
    |o and and talking with me, then they said thanks and ran off to play some more.  They never asked me for money, they didn't
    |pick pocket me. It was simply an innocent and light hearted moment between friends.  


        |You should frame it, bedazzle it, and send it to him. He will shit glitter with excitement.


            |hmmm.... I see a business opportunity.  


                |Yea I guess, if you're into the glitter industry.


                    |Well, glitter from the ass of some young boy has a much higher market value than traditionally sourced glit
                    |er.  In certain demographics, of course.


                        |Excuse me?


                            |You heard him.

        |This brings back memories. I was in Gujarat years ago for work, and basically spent an hour taking photos of all the ki

    |One of the tips [Matt](http://youtu.be/zlfKdbWwruY) used to give when traveling around the world was that, when you go to c
    |untries where people don't have digital cams, it is always nice to bring a small paper printer around (there are travel siz
    |d ones, which do tiny prints, 4" × 6", probably smaller).////After you take the pics you can give prints around to people a
    |d you will make many people incredibly happy. As a backpacker, you can get to eat with/talk to parents you otherwise may no
    |. It just helps people to open to you without spoken interaction :)////EDIT: I do know that people have digicams and cellph
    |nes in India, I wasn't try to imply anything to the contrary. Ignore that bit, just have Matt's tip  in mind ;)


        |That sounds like a neat idea!


        |Just going to be that guy who points out that most people in Mumbai have cellphones. 


            |Sure, but if you travel outside of the big cities you will have lots of people asking you to take their photo. They
            |love seeing the picture on the screen, so a print out would be a great thing for these people. If ant count the num
            |er of babies I was asked to take a snap of in the space of 3 weeks!


            |Kids don't have camera phones though, and they are the ones who apreciate the pictures the most.////&gt;Me, picture
            | Me! Me! Me picture!//


            |In my experience of India only wealthy people had smart phones or even camera phones. "Most people" in Mumbai can't
            |spare the $20 (approx rs. 1000) for a basic cell phone, let alone a cameraphone. A handheld printer would still be 
            |elcome. ////edit: I know that everyone has a phone, but they are all Nokia bricks. I've been to Mumbai FFS... I sho
            |ldn'tve said that most people can't afford any phone. I was just trying to point out that a decent cameraphone is a
            |big reach for most people, so you shouldn't assume that they are common. I saw maybe 50 people with smartphones (a 
            |ouple iPhones, mostly Blackberrys or Nokia Symbian devices) in my time there, and maybe twice that many with featur
            |phones that had cameras, and sometimes speakers. A few people wanted to take photos with me using their phones, or 
            |ad me photograph them. One couple in Amritsar just handed me their baby and took a photo.  


                |700 million cell phones. Not only the wealthy have phones here, everybody has them....


                |I live in India, it's actually very common to have a cellphone, even the poorest have them but especially the m
                |ddle class, there's sort of an obsession actually to show off how rich you are by having a nicer cellphone than
                |everyone else. My point is it's certainly not a rare or extravagant thing like the post above would suggest. 


                |Nearly everyone in India has cell phones, but mainly they're cheap Nokia bricks. According to the Indian govern
                |ent there are about 867 million cell phones in use in India, or about 70% of the population. Mumbai being a met
                |opolitan hub and probably the richest city in India, I would expect that cell phones to be even more popular th

                    |I'm well aware that India has a rising middle class that can afford consumer goods. I would say that a hand

            |Really too young to decide if he's gay yet. Anyway, straight men in India walk around holding hands with their stra

                |Being gay is not a "decision" - more of a realization, I imagine. ////There was this kid who lived across the s
                |reet from me when I was growing up. We didn't know WHAT was up with him, only that he kind of "acted like a gir
                |". He was OK - He could throw/catch a baseball, but couldn't bat for shit. One of the kids in the neighborhood 
                |ecided to call him a "sissy" one day, and promptly got his ass handed to him. ////I find out years later that W
                |s was gay, and I thought to myself *that explains everything!* I knew this kid since he &amp; I were about four
                |years old, and could never figure out why he was *different* from the rest of us. Turns out he was just gay. No
                |big deal, but it wasn't a decision he made.//


                    |what is wrong with you haha ... he meant that the kid is too young for us to decide if he's gay yet or not.
                    |///as in, there's a good chance the kid isn't running around boning dudes. and we certainly cannot tell fro
                    | this picture if he's sexually attracted to dudes (in fact, he looks so young that he may just now be appro

                |True. But as a gay guy, my first thought when I saw the picture was that the kid is probably gay. It's not the 
                |hysical contact with his friend. It's more his face, and posture.////I probably shouldn't stereotype because so
                |e of my straight friends are pretty feminine...but it's hard not to because in general it kind of works. I have
                |photos of myself as a young kid where I look pretty gay. And now that I'm older it's not as obvious for some re
                |son, but I like to hold onto those old photos.


                    |Western gaydar doesn't really work on Indian culture. The men are a lot more affectionate. I worked for a c
                    |mpany that brought a bunch of Indians straight from India to work for the company for a short project. All 
                    |he men stood like this, and touched each other a lot more than any American man I've ever seen, regardless

                        |But what about their faces?////&gt;In an initial experiment, researchers Nicholas Rule and Nalini Ambad
                        | from Tufts University perused online dating sites and carefully selected 45 straight male faces and 45
                        |gay male faces. All of these photos were matched for orientation (only faces shown looking forward were
                        |used) and facial alterations (none of the images contained jewelry, glasses or facial hair). To control
                        |for context, the faces were also cut and pasted onto a white background for the study. These 90 faces w
                        |re then shown to 90 participants in random order, who were asked simply to judge the target's "probable
                        |sexual orientation" (gay or straight) by pressing a button. ////&gt;Surprisingly, all participants (bot
                        | men and women) scored above chance on this gaydar task, correctly identifying the gay faces. Even more
                        |surprisingly, accuracy rate was just as good when the images were exposed at a rapid rate of only 50 mi
                        |liseconds, which offered participants no opportunity to consciously process the photo. [source](http://

                            |I agree, this kid set off my gaydar, and the gaydar of gay men is well known to be fabulous.

                            |Lol I'm pretty sure they know not to do that... However our HR didn't train them at all... Poor bas

                    | 


                    |I hate double standards.  I have no issues with gay people.  I think they are cool- we are all people after
                    |all.////But if I see someone acting gay (flamboyant, touching people... etc) I'm a bigot for saying "that g
                    |y looks gay"////Fuck that.  I can also tell who is gay or not.  


                        |I don't think that makes you a bigot. It's a pretty reasonable assumption in some circumstances.////One
                        |thing you have to watch out for though is that it's not really polite to mention this kind of stuff. Th
                        | kid might not realize that he's different. He might realize it, and be actively trying to cover it up.
                        |So for the most part, I just kind of make a mental note of it, smile and kind of move on. ////edit: Sam

                        |t's probably why there is a double standard in place. 


                    |yeah, I realize that stereotyping and discriminating is bad, but mostly stereotypes emerge because they hav
                    | some validity.////I fully admit I am completely being stereotypical here off of one picture and was being

                |Maybe in Montana it takes until you're 23 to realize you're gay.


                |Well as many gay men have told me... it's not about deciding... but how you are born. He may not have entered p

    |Is it me, or does he look a lot like Daniel Tosh?


        |My first thought was Lloyd Christmas.


            |Mine too actually. I'm not sure why I went with the second person he reminded me of. He looks like a mix of the two


            |It's the Moe Howard haircut. Or maybe the Pete Rose haircut.////Whatever, the kid looks happy. I envy him that. //


            |It's their love child


        |Came in this thread to make sure someone said this. 


        |I clicked, ctrl-f for Tosh, found your post. No, it's not just you.//


        |no, dendi//


        |And is it me or does he look like Sanjay Gupta as a child?


            |THAT'S RACIST


    |I went to India once and that is one thing that surprised me. As soon as you bring out a camera in a poor area the kids go 
    |uts. I was at a school and asked one kid if I could take his picture. The first picture was just him, second snap was like 
    | kids, 3rd was like 20, and by the fourth picture (like 15 seconds later) every student in the area (like 100 kids) were tr
    |ing to get in the frame. They were so excited. It really just made me melt.


        |I don't know if this is an Indian thing or not, but whenever I see a foreigner roaming in the streets of my city, I alw
        |ys go up and ask "Do you speak English?" and try to strike up a conversation to find out where they are from and a bit 
        |bout their lives. ////Last year, I met a few French people, a bald English guy, an old American couple and a other Amer
        |can guy. I still keep in touch with the French and English guys through social networks. Also, my city being somewhat o
        | a popular tourist destination allows me to do this way too often. ////But with the kids, it's different. They just lik
        | being in the camera screen, no matter who it is held by. I was once working with a NGO regarding a project put forward
        |by my school and I had a camera with me in a slum. Scores and scores of kids would get pictures taken, and many of them
        |would even pose and get annoyed if the pictures didn't come out good.


    |That kid in the stripes looks awesome. He looks like he wants to drag you to a coffee shop, sit you down, and listen to how
    |your date went last Friday. OMG Don't leave out any details!!!!


        |Well, It went great! I brought two orders of Tandori mixed grill from a place on Fulton Ave. called Kavari. It was way 
        |oo much food. I didn't realize it was family style! Anyway it was about $30 bucks and it came with like 12 different co
        |tainers of bread and crisps and sauces and yogurts and soups and desert. Crazy.//Suzi loved it, and I'm sure she loved 
        |ot having to cool us dinner (our usual date). She drank wine and I had Black Butte Porter. //We talked for a while, abo
        |t her job and the construction of my Disneyland costume. After dinner we watched a couple of episodes of the IT crowd o
        | Netflix, which is a lot of fun for me, because she is British.  //Then we turned off the television, cuddled for a bit
        |and passed out on the futon!


    |My dad traveled a lot to various places for the government in the 80's and 90's.  He once was asked in Pakistan I think if 
    |e would take a picture by a stranger.  My dad asked if he wanted the picture and the guy roughly said oh no keep it.  I jus
    | wanted something to show that I exist.  We live around so much digital media we don't recognize this guys position.  In a 
    |orld where you are born, go old, then die with one generation after generation living the same way a picture means a lot mo
    |e than we would think it would.  I wouldn't think twice about it.////Actually I think it might have been Mumbai (same trip)

    |After spending three months living in Tamil Nadu, I can confirm that the best thing about that country is the children. The
    |'re so innocent and carefree and excited. They have no qualms asking for photos or getting their friends and turning it int

    |jeeesh, I have hundreds of photos just like this from my years of travel in Asia.....had I known I could get this many fake

        |I love that photo! Sorry it didn't get more attention.//


        |This guy looks like Dendi.


    |I had a life changing moment in India.////My sister and her husband were quite a distance in front of me, and they had a bo
    |tle of water with them.  A kid who was around 3 or 4 years old ran up to them, somewhat pestering them while pointing at th
    |ir water bottles.  Thinking he wanted money, they gave him some coins.  But I could tell that wasn't what he was after, at 
    |ll, because he looked defeated.  He was in desperate need of water.////Finally he ran up to me, and I put my water bottle i
    | front of him.   He clasped it, with his hands, almost uncertain if he was allowed to take it from me.  I let my grip go, a
    |d it was now firmly in his hands.  ////Never in my life, have I seen somebody so ecstatic over something that I take for gr
    |nted on a daily basis.////He ran off with the water bottle, and I left India with a fond memory.////edit:  your pic reminds
    |me of his smile.


        |Way to make this about you.


            |the pic immediately unearthed that memory of mine.   I thought it would be nice to share.////


            |Way to be a douche nozzle.


    |Beautiful thing capturing such genuineness 


    |I had to take so many pictures of people in India. A strange thing was that many people wanted pictures with me. There are 
    | lot of pictures of me holding strangers kids or even wedding pictures with me....crazy!


        |Maybe they recognize that we are all just one big family. Something America has yet to.


            |Hmm not sure about that....//


                |Yea youre right, your dog is more human than your neighbors. Its not like our DNA is remotely close, oh wait.


    |His Buddy is not amused.


        |His buddy was giggling and excited to join in.  He just decided to strike a pose when I was ready to snap the photo.  :
        | )     They had fun looking at it in the camera display and laughing after the photo was taken.  


            |You should email them the pic.....

                |Are you serious? 


                    |No. It was my first reaction that lasted about .3 seconds.


                        |I hope YouFeelShame lol


                            |why? i thought it was funny


            |His buddy looks like he's doing a "not bad" obama face


        |I thought that at first, but the longer I looked, the more I thought he looked happy and excited with a straight face f
        |r the picture


            |yep, happy kid. to me, it looked like a ''not bad'' face.


    |The people there look so much cleaner and well-off than the people here. It's a strange contrast to the background.


        |When you live surrounded by garbage, you can take pride in keeping your personal appearance neat (the only thing you re
        |lly can keep clean). When you come from a sanitized, litterless city, you stand out by looking grungy and unkempt. Huma
        |s love contrast, finding ways to set themselves apart. Although I prefer the clean look myself, I don't think one is wo
        |se or better. ////(But seriously, Seattle hipsters, take a shower)


        |Well, I am an Indian and I can confirm. Indian people like to keep themselves clean. They are very particular about it.
        |But when it comes to the surroundings, they just don't care. Also, generalization is a very dangerous thing, especially
        |when you are talking about India. 


            |I didn't intend to generalize anything. I simply meant the people there in the picture, but I suppose I could have 
            |orded that more carefully.


    |another case of white people being fascinated by non white people...


        |I hate that. My opinion on that subject has never been very popular, but this fascination really angers me. Not only be
        |ause of the "aw, non-white people smiling, soooo cute", but also because of this picture wouldn't be so succesful if it
        |was in a richer country. I personally find it so (I don't know if these are the right words) arrogant and condescending


    |"Jesus, Kevin.  Again with the picture taking?  I gotta be at work in 15 minutes!"


    |[I took this one in a small village in Rajasthan](http://imgur.com/QI2Yz3g). The kids were gutted when I couldn't print the
    |picture out from my Iphone. 


    |He has the same expression as overly attatched girlfriend!


    |The expressions you captured with this photo is almost breathtaking.////The sheer fact he had his picture taken gave him th
    |t smile, I wish children from here, America, could get as happy over such little things.

                    |Which road isn't?


                        |Hah, true, but he specifically asked about IITB. ////On a related note, I miss that they no longer have

                            |Havent been there either since i left college and no more Mood indigo for me then.


                        |THIS!


                |I live just a km away from there. The roads are much wider but has gotten more congested since its one of the m

            |Thank you! I've been before, I live in Bangalore (Brit living in India). Unfortunately I'm only in Mumbai a couple

                |No doubt about that. I don't think you'd want more than a couple of days here, anyways :) 


                    |I prefer a more relaxed city. Although the bars are pretty awesome in Bombay.


    |you just got robbed


        |Twist: The kids uploaded this to reddit for that sweet, sweet karma.


            |with the stolen camera!


        |These pockets were made for picking, and thats just what i'll do.


            |These pockets are gonna get picked all over yoooou.

        |Glad I wasn't the only one who saw it!


    |I went to Mexico for a missionary trip. We were there to hand out toys and clothes to those in poverty and build a church f
    |r them to worship in. We had gone to a village where my group had mission-ed in the past to see how the people were doing a
    |d to hand out more clothes and toys. I had one of those instant Polaroid cameras and 3 cartons of film, which i believe had
    |about 10 sheets each. I started taking pictures of the kids to take home with me. I showed them after the photo was develop
    |d. They were so excited and shocked my the photo. All of a sudden I had kids and families coming up to me asking me to take
    |their pictures. I did. I let them take the photos home with them. A lot of them do not have photos to cherish of their love
    | ones.////I'll never forget the joy on their faces.


    |As a reporter, anytime kids in town see me with my camera, they always ask if I can take a picture so they can be in the ne
    |spaper. I've had some awesome pictures of them playing basketball, playing in a creek, etc. And the parents always love the
    |pictures when they see them in the paper too.


    |First picture////Photogenic as Fuck


    |He's like the Indian version of Jim Carrey (Dumb and Dumber style)


    |Umm... is it just me or does stripes look alarmingly like Indian Jim Carrey?


    |That is the look of pure happiness.////(And his friend has the look of "alright, alright, I'm here and smiling, hold your h
    |rses.")


    |Just the joy in their eyes...i downloaded this pic.:)


    |haha this made me smile :)


    |I hope they will see this picture someday.


    |When I was in Kolcatta, the kids ABSOLUTELY LOVED getting their pictures taken. And even more, they loved taking pictures. 
    | gave my camera to one of the boys at the childrens home we were at, and he spent all afternoon taking pictures and videos,
    |and showing them to everyone who would look. It was awesome. 


    |hahaha he looks so happy! just pure joy in his expression 


    |Such a cute picture!  I smiled really big!  Thank you :-)


    |First they take all our tech jobs, now they take our photo ops?


    |During a multi-week visit to India I met a kid in Hampi that introduced himself. He asked me some questions about my visit 
    |nd the United States then he asked if I'd remember him. That was in May, 2005 and Yes, Muhammad, I remember you.////I also 
    |emember my friend hitting a local while riding a rented moped and having to pay him off. $20.


    |A friend of mine goes into rural areas in South Africa during his holidays.  He takes a camera and a printer.  He finds chi
    |dren and takes their photograph and prints a copy for them.  It means so much to some families here who will possibly not g
    |t another photograph in years.  


    |Kid on left has obviously had his photon taken before, or is just the coolest kid in school.


    |That's how the kids were in Kenya! Even some adults just wanted their picture taken because they'd never seen a picture of 
    |hemselves before. I wish I had a Polaroid camera or something so that I could let them keep it :/ 


    |*"Can my friend join in the picture? He's FAAAAAABULOUS!"*


    |Does anybody else see a young jim carrey from dumb and dumber? 


        |This should be higher up...


            |First thing I thought as well. I think it's the bowl cut + stupid smile. :)

    |As someone who has lived in Mumbai all my life, why do you guys hate my city? D: 


    |jazz hand !


    |I love this picture. Great smile. Haha.


    |This seemed to happen all the time in India.  The first few times I thought they wanted us to take pictures with them using
