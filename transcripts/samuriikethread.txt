The chalk ninjas at my school strike again(/r/gaming.reddit: what's new in gaming)




    |Why isn't Toad giving us the middle thumb in this one?


        |Yeah that would have been great


        |ikr


    |i know this is super stupid, but im really disappointed that the quality of the handwriting doesnt match the quality of the
    |drawing////edit-a word


        |I'm glad I'm not the only person who thinks that's weird.


            |I personally have terrible hand writing but love drawing. I dont quite get why, but its just always been that way.


                |can comfrim. aful spelling, am progemmer. 


        |I know a lot of people, myself included, who can draw well but can't write legibly.


            |Prove it.////Draw a gumba riding a pink unicorn screaming "singing in the rain"!


                |What's a gumba?


                    |German


                        |How to draw a German?


                    |Sorry. I meant Goomba.////The brown turds with legs from Mario!


        |I commented below. My sister drew this picture. She didn't write the words, so that's why the quality doesn't match. 


            |Yeah, my sister drew it, too. 


        |Yeah, almost like words were added later.


        |They're both really shitty, actually.


            |ah theres that signature reddit edginess


                |Ah yes, calling an opinion 'edgy' on reddit.  That's so high and mighty of you.  Classic reddit.  Are you sayin
                | it isn't a shitty piece of chalk art?

                        |that's what happens when you've been drinking a bottle of whiskey.  you shove your friend's face across
                        |a scanner and call it art.


                            |Well, I'll tell you it looks cool. I just don't see why you're being so angry in this thread though

        |That was quick.


            |All these novelty accounts need to learn to stop berating themselves; shitty this and crappy that.

            |I expected at least one of these would end up raping him....


            |The non-NSFW one is how I always wanted it to end. &lt;3


                |That or something like [this](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md0ptygPXk1rrqkwqo1_1280.png). Surprise endings
                |are good endings.


            |Why did Mario's chest hair become inverted in the last panel of the NSFW one? 


                |Mario is turned towards the turtle, his left arm is covering his junk.

            |If you are making a game by yourself and dont even know how to fucking google yet, then it's a lost cause. Give up.

        |Saw this at 11am before before my Qudditch game at 1


        |URI like university of Rhode Island? 


            |yes.


    |Dude, this is outside Hope at University of Rhode Island! Just saw it this morning. There's also a drawing of Mario, and a 
    |oo. Did you see the one last year where they drew Mario Kart tracks down the street. Shells, speed strips, banana peels, th
    | whole thing down the whole road. I know the kids that do this.//


        |Don't forget about Luigi!


            |That thing stayed on the wall for over six months! Amazing! Remember the Nemo on Butterfield that said "I touched t
            |e butt".


        |Hell yeah uri I love that school. 


            |It's the shit.


    |Or maybe OP just drew it on himself


        |OP is brick wall?


            |OP is a brick.... *HOUSE*


                |He's mightay mightay just lettin it all hang out?


                |Ouch....

                            |Doesn't it, um, smell when you pull out? I don't know much about dogs..


                                |It smells like hot dogs//But it doesn't taste like it though


                                    |I guess a bit of peanut butter and the dog would clean it up for you? I'm learning :-) 


                |Who was phone?


                    |No this is Patrick.


            |OP is built like a brick shithouse


            |I read that in a Russian accent. Then I spoke it out loud to hear what it would sound like. Then my wife laughed at
            |me and called me stupid.


        |I have no artistic ability.


            |Not with that attitude you don't.


                |Apply yourself!


            |You don't need artistic ability to draw Toad. He's really simple. Just look at a picture and I guarantee you can dr
            |w him.


            |Just like most of the other 'artists' on reddit. 


                |[Like this guy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/)


            |Neither did the person who drew that.  It looks like shit.


        |/r/Karmaconspiracy


        |yeah, how else would he know that it was ninja's? It could have been a single ninja. Or chalk wizards. 


        |That would be even better.

    |Athens?


        |Athens what?


    |My sister drew this! She didn't write the words though. 


        |Well that explains the poor writing compared to the excellent drawing


    |You know, the word "ninja" is thrown around a lot these days...


    |Thats not a bad idea, you can express your ideas, but it can just be washed off. Like grafitti but no crime... Until next t
    |me chalk ninja!


    |What I am most concerned about is that they're striking "again." What else have they done? Will they be returning? Answers 
    |an! I need them!


        |We will be returning.  Last year we did Mario Kart and Monopoly.


            |As KPM said, we did a very nice Mario Kart last year with a less successful game of monopoly, and it all started wi
            |h the entire game of Pacman 2 years ago.


        |This school has a chalk club where students get together and decorate the campus sidewalks with themed pictures. This o
        |e was Mario themed. It rained last night and there were other things like pipes, ? Blocks, and princess peach. Toad was
        |on the wall and was fortunate enough to survive. 


            |No it doesn't.  We just do it when we figure out something cool to do.


    |More like your job is in another castle.


    |There's been a spate of sightings at [Princeton](http://instagram.com/p/ezp5duMEXS/) too. [Instagram link to university pag
    |].


    |At our school clubs are allowed to chalk on concrete anywhere on campus. It's kind of considered an essential part of a clu
    |. They just do monthly pressure washing. However you get in huge trouble for chalking on brick because it is very hard to c
    |me off. I have seen chalk on brick that had a date that was 3 months in the past. So this freezing is going to last a bit u
    |til the school comes and pressure washes it (which will take a long time)


        |We drew Luigi last year on another building and he lasted the whole school year!


        |Yeah they tried to nail us once for brick chalking calling it vandalism. It didn't stick but we had to wash it off. The
        | tried to make it a way bigger deal than it should have been.


    |Cute!


    |I feel like most people here probably never even played the first Mario game and have just been conditioned to recognize th
    |s crap.  


    |It is URI just saw this as i went to go get breakfast lol


        |Me too. 


    |Makes me wish I was back in college, and that I could draw... 


    |They should call the artist mario, because he just got 1 up'd


    |I never liked toad for some reason I'm sorry. Seems like a wuss.


    |Is this SBU? looks just like the pillar right outside the physics building


    |Chalk doesn't come off of brick very easily.


    |/r/gaming,  I fucking hate you... 


    |This is more funny to me because at U of M we had a "CASL" department (College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters) and it's pro
    |ounced "Castle."


    |Just because your school has brick on some buildings doesn't mean this was at your school....


    |Oh shit URI//


    |Haha, this is why i love URI. 


    |Turlington, University of Florida?


    |I go to this University. I recogized it immediately. Damn. Hope.


    |That looks suspiciously like my school. Could you give a region for this (you don't have to be specific)?


        |Earth.


            |Wow, me too


    |I wish I had a witty remark about his art skill being in another castle or something. 


    |Furman?


    |These ninjas......it's you, isn't it?


    |When did he strike the first time?


    |RHIT?


    |UVA?


        |That's what I was thinking, looks just like UVA. Do you go there? :D


            |Went. '12


    |Tcnj?


    |My money is on The University Of South Alabama. Similar Mario themed chalk art has been appearing there for several weeks.


    |ECU?


    |It doesn't matter how crappy of an artist you are, as long as you draw something videogame related.


    |Degreets? lol fail...


        |It says "Sorry student, your degree is in another castle" 


    |this is pretty fucking retarded 


    |What year did this game come out?  I'm kind of surprised a college student could recognize this.


    |FSU?


    |ITT Tech North Houston?


    |r/cringe


        |I really don't get why on /r/cringepics or /r/cringe the people think that any depiction of something virtual is cringe
        |orthy IRL. I don't draw stuff from games etc IRL but sometimes it looks nice. ( for example OP's picture) 


            |They don't. This guy just sucks.


            |Possibly because they are embarrassed about their hobbies and any real-world mention of them causes them to cringe.
