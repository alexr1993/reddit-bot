        |That reminds me of the play No Exit, by Jean-Paul Sartre.  Three characters are in an implied Hell, and each is able to

        |ke to put an effort into reading so we go with swedish. Trying to get back to the main menue takes a few tries and a bu
        |h of "NOOO not that button!!" from the rest of us. ////Ten minutes after she put the disc in she presses "start movie" 
        |ut oh no, it's far from over. //The procedure of making it a full screen almost resolves in her pressing x, taking down
        |the whole movie. I tell her to dubble click, she does that and I sigh, finally, we can watch the goddamn movie.////But 
        |hen, confusing all of us, she makes the window smaller again. We have no idea of what she's doing. //To my horror I see
        |the mouse move down to the start button, and she accually manages to click "log out" before all of us screams "NOOOOO!"

            | he had to spend eternity standing in a lake full of water up to his chin, but if he'd try to drink it, the water w
            |uld drain away. There were grapes hanging from a tree easily within hand's reach, but as soon as he'd try to eat on
            |, they would wither and die.////Another version of the myth says he was invited to Olympus and there, he tried to s
            |eal ambrosia and nectar - the food and drink of the gods - and obviously,  they caught him then too.////Seems like

                |uline nouns and from -on to -um for neuter nouns. As it happens, Tantalos is the Greek name and Tantalus is the
                |Latin name. Cf. lycaeon and lycaeum. My Latin is much better than my Greek, so I have but few examples, maybe s

        |I once had sleep paralysis and thought that this exact thing was happening to me. Without a doubt the most frightening

            |Pro-tip for everyone, if you get into sleep paralysis just hold your breath until your body snaps out. 


                |I don't know about holding your breath but sleeping on your side stops sleep paralysis events for me and many p
                |ople.  If I ever feel that odd sluggish feeling that tends to lead to an event I always roll to my side to slee
                | now.  Also opening a window or otherwise keeping the room from being hot and stuffy helps.


                    |do you get this when you sleep on your back? cause sounds like what i'm having from time to time


                        |It's significantly more common when you sleep on your back. 


                    | I get it regardless of how I sleep. Definitely going to try holding my breath next time. I usually panic a
                    |d gasp for breath, and I get weird palsy tremors in whatever limb I try to move including my neck/head. 


                    |I try to, but sometimes it's too late and you can feel your leg barely move until it just stops, then you'r
                    | stuck, and it's shitty.....


                    |I tried sleeping on my back once to improve my shitty posture.////I got sleep paralysis first try, never ag
                    |in. 


                |If this actually works, I will come back here and give you gold. I've had sleep paralysis moments ever since I 
                |as 8 years old (25 now). It's the most horrible feeling ever: you can't move, you're awake, yet something is ju
                |t off and strange about the world, and the fact that you can't articulate why terrifies you even more. I also t
                |nd to feel like something heavy is on my chest, keeping me from breathing steady, so that doesn't help much. As
                |I've gotten older, I've taught myself to calm down just enough to say, "go back to sleep..sleep..," but even th
                |t is a feat and doesn't always work. So yeah.. hopefully I can remember this and give it a shot. Thanks!


                    |&gt; yet something is just off and strange about the world, and the fact that you can't articulate why terr
                    |fies you even more////Holy crap, that *perfectly* describes a majority of the "scary" dreams that I have. T
                    |ere's nothing rationally or justly scary about it, it's just that I get this almost mentally fused sense of
                    |fear and anxiety. It's often times bound to a seemingly insignificant trigger like a foghorn or a certain p
                    |cture.


                |And then when that doesn't work, you try to breathe and you body won't let you.////!


                    |Worst case scenario is that that would cause you to pass out, and your body's autopilot would let you breat
                    |e again. It would be traumatic, but it wouldn't kill you. Unless your panic causes a heart attack, at least


                |That goes against all your instincts though. I've had sleep paralysis before and everything in my mind tells me
                |I can't move *and* I'm dying.

                |You're in control of your breathing? I've heard you can move your eyes but why would the body, who thinks your 
                |sleep, give you manual override control of your breathing? That's fascinating


                    |Your breathing is not affected by sleep paralysis. The breathing you do in your dreams is the same your sle
                    |ping body is doing. That's why the plug-your-nose-and-breathe lucid dream reality check works. You plug you
                    | nose with dream hands, but your real hands of course didn't move, so when you breathe you can breathe "thr

                        |I actually used to have really bad sorting and when sick, would every once in a while stop breathing an

                        |reathing, come to him. Well later on in the dream I stopped breathing and he told me to breathe through
                        |my mouth and it worked. I went the rest of the dream breathing through my mouth and woke up with a stuf

            |Man I've never had sleep paralysis but it sounds like the scariest shit ever. Did you see the sleep paralysis demon
            |by your bed by any chance?


                |I'm not the OP, but I've experienced sleep paralysis a couple of times. It's not so much that you see anything 
                |n the room with you. It's more that you can sense that there is someone or some*thing• there. Now *that* is muc
                | more scary.////Not to forget the possibility of auditory hallicinations, ominous laughter and whatnot, as well
                | So yeah, that shit ain't fun.


                    |It sounds horrible. What causes it? 


                        |Sleep paralysis occurs during REM sleep (the part of sleep where you dream), to stop your body flailing
                        |and acting out your dreams. It is possible for sleep to be disturbed but for the paralysis to remain. I
                        |believe the exact mechanism isn't known.


                            |And the reason it's scary is because you panic when you can't move, causing the hallucinations.


                            |IIRC this mechanism doesn't develop until mid-infancy, which is why fetuses "kick" during pregnancy
                            |they are dreaming and their bodies haven't developed a sleep paralysis mechanism so all their dream
                            |movements are actually happening.////How cute!

                            |those things cause it, but it doesn't happen nearly as much anymore since I stopped smoking and ove

                        |Nope, it isn't that horrible. I go into the state of sleeping paralysis almost 10-15 times a year. At f
                        |rst, I was totally freaked out. I'd just try everything to make it stop and try to wake up. But after a

                |hear this really deep heavy slow breathing right next to my face until I realised that it was just what my brea
                |hing sounds like while I'm asleep, that made it a lot less scary. Other things are a bit less explainable thoug
                |, like I get this feeling that there's something flying around the room and I can hear sounds that sound sort o
                | like a UFO landing in a film, sort of like [this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY8VSoHEaFo) but much deeper


                    |People often do "see" things, though. Many people (including a close friend of mine and my sister-in-law) c
                    |n open their eyes during sleep paralysis. But, since it's usually dark, the eyes are taking in a lot of vag
                    |e, poorly defined visual information which the stressed limbic system, scrambling for edges and patterns, r
                    |ads as people or demons or ghosts or whatever.


                    |Actually, in places that have higher cultural rates of sleep paralysis and the adjacent hypnagogic hallucin
                    |tions (such as Newfoundland and Indonesia), people DO experience the creature sitting on their chest.////It
                    |runs in my family, all the women on my mother's side have it. I've seen a black shadow monster sitting on m
                    | chest, as well as a horror child with its eyes gouged out sitting over me and posing from Munsch's The Scr
                    |am.////My sister also experienced one where a witch was sitting on her chest. She thinks she might have had
                    |the woolen blanket up over her face, because the creature reached over to her face, and she could feel it s
                    |ratching on her skin. She was pretty horrified when recounting it the next day.//////Not saying this is typ
                    |cal, but at least I know in Newfoundland that there are plenty of accounts of the nightmare sitting on you.
                    |I guess its our brain's way of explaining why we can't move. 


                    |The other random feelings (flying objects etc) are simply parts of the dreams that your brain is experienci
                    |g at the moment.  So perhaps there is a slight current of air in your room that your body subconsciously pi
                    |ks up on, which in your mostly sleeping brain is turned into a dream about a UFO.  ////Your brain dreams ev
                    |ry night, no exceptions (if sober), and waking sleep paralysis is when you straddle the line between deep s
                    |eep and consciousness.  So you become slightly aware of your physical surroundings (bedroom etc) but your b
                    |ain also combines those sensory inputs with its dream state ideas.


                    |I just posted a comment to this same guys answer, but in brief I was able to open my eyes after a dream but
                    |not move. And I did see a shadow coming over and pushing me down so I do think people see the demon.


                        |I keep seeing a wizard and trolls laughing and mocking me but just always at the corner of my eye


                    |You're far from the first person to talk about imagining UFO's during sleep paralysis, I commented on anoth
                    |r thread awhile back with a similar experience: http://en-us.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jyzc5/what_is
                    |the_worst_physical_feeling_you_can/cbjtd99?context=3////I've only ever had it happen to me once, but it lef
                    | an impressionable memory. 


                    |I sometimes get that alien sound right before I go to sleep, like when I'm right on the brink. It usually s
                    |arts as the ceiling fan or some other semi regular/semi constant  background sound, but as my mind shuts of
                    | the sound gets louder and louder in my head and becomes more of a pulse than the original sound. I usually
                    |shift or something to break up the sound since another sound puts the volume in perspective in my brain.///
                    |But sometimes I purposefully let the volume overwhelm me, to see how intense it will get. I've gotten to th
                    | point where I can practically feel the sound but inevitably some part of my brain will suddenly wake me up
                    | wide awake with a huge inhale and a body jerk as if there's actual danger. I always know what just happene
                    | and I'm not scared, so I don't know what mechanism causes this. It's as if at the second my conscious mind
                    |passes control to my sleeping mind, my sleeping mind goes "danger! Loud sound! Wake up and check it out!" B
                    |t then conscious mind is like "yeah, it's the fan, dummy. We already knew that. Starting sleep process over
                    |again."


                    |I saw a demon once.  It spoke to me in some strange tongue, I couldn't move and thought to it,"I don't unde
                    |stand you."  Then it spoke in English.   It was very scary, but since I knew about sleep paralysis I just w
                    |ited it out until I could move. 


                        |What was it saying?


                    |I don't know, I have seen things on several occasions during sleep paralysis. The worst time....one was a n
                    |ght I fell asleep and woke up not really realizing I was under sleep paralysis and hear my door open and sh
                    |t.  My eyes are open but I can't move and a dark figure was in the corner of my room and moved closer to me
                    |and finally was hovering above me and pressing it's hands up my back. During this I kept thinking to myself
                    |"oh it's okay it's just my roommate" then realizing I had locked my door and I couldn't move. I knew I need
                    |d to wake myself up and panicked for a solid 5 minutes until I could move my arm enough get out of it. Obvi
                    |usly no one was there, but I did "see" something...someone. 


                |I've had it once. It was not fun. 


                |I have a problem with sleep paralysis and night terrors.////It feels like boney fingers are digging into my ste
                |num holding me down. I've seen shadow monsters too. Absolutely terrifying.////Edit: There have been auditory ha
                |lucinations too. A lot of times what I see and hear varies (sometimes there are none) but those wretched finger
                | are always there.


                |Not the OP either but I was had sleep paralysis where I felt like a huge man was trying to anally rape me while
                |I was screaming in my head but no sound came out. Wish I was joking.


                |I used to get it pretty badly when I was younger (finally stopped a few years ago). And it was an absolute nigh
                |mare. Every time I got it, it was usually the same scenario:////I "wake up" in the dark and I can't move. And I
                |know something is in the apartment/house with me. I can't really hear it but I get this strange feeling that so
                |ething else is out there. ////And every single time, for whatever reason. I call out "Hello?" And now I can fin
                |lly hear something. First my voice and then the rushing sound of footsteps getting louder and louder as it gets
                |closer.////And then there it is in front of me.  ////It has a figure of any average joe. But it's completely gr
                |y and blurry. And it pauses for just a milisecond as it stands in front of me and then finally rushes right at 
                |e, which usually gives me a vertigo sensation.//// And then I finally wake up. 


                |I actually had it two nights ago, its happens maybe every week or so. It doesn't really bother me as much anymo
                |e. I just cannot sleep on anything but my stomach.////The first few times I had it was beyond scary, then I bro
                |ght it up to my dad, turns out he has it and so does my grandmother. I remember one time I had it and it felt l
                |ke someone was running their fingers down my back.////As long as you can like wiggle a toe or something, it'll 
                |ake you feel better.


                |Have had it several times during my life, all during very high stress times when my sleep scheduled was fucked 
                |p (during midterms while dealing with relationship issues, right after a grandparent died etc). I have seen the
                |dark shadow twice, a ghost another time, and had an out of body experience a fourth time, where I had the abili
                |y to listen to any thought or conversation in the world.  ////The only way I can describe my sleep paralysis/as
                |ociated hallucinations is that they feel completely real in ways that normal dreams don't. Things have a certai
                | depth, weight, warmth, and emotion.////tl;dr: It's a mind fuck.


                |I've had it a few times and each time it felt as if someone was sitting on top of me (over the covers) holding 
                |own the covers so that I couldn't move. Horrible.


                |In my case I don't always "see" something, I just know with a certainty that it's there.  


                |I have it on rare occasions, the "demon" on even rarer occasions. It is always just out of sight but you have a
                |feeling that it is there. On one occasion I felt that there was some sort of reptile monster on the pillow behi
                |d my head and I could hear it grunting. On another it was a blonde-haired ghost woman approaching the bed that 
                | could glimpse peripherally. You want to turn to face and confront it or do anything but just lie there but you
                | body feels like it is made of stone and too heavy to move anything. Nonetheless you half have that feeling of 
                |eing hid under the blankets, that if you can't see it properly it can't hurt you. Maybe some people have it so 
                |he demon is right in their face, I've never had that but it would be horrible!////It can be very scary but not 
                |s bad as you might think. You are in your bed feeling your eyes are open so you think it is not a dream until y
                |u are really awake later, and telling yourself "this is a dream" doesn't get you out of it. Still however lucid
                |you might feel you are not really and it does not leave you traumatised or anything like a real bad memory woul
                |, so it is not "the scariest shit ever." At worst it is like a regular nightmare, if you've ever had one of tho
                |e (I mean a dream that leaves you with a sense of terror, not just a dream where bad things happen). If I didn'
                | know that sleep paralysis was a recognised phenomenon it might be worse, I can imagine how it led to belief in
                |ghosts or alien abduction or whatever else. 


                |On many occasions i saw a demon's hand dragging me down to hell. at first i was scared as fuck, but after coupl
                | of times i learned to enjoy it, anyway these days my sleep paralysis looks like [this](http://www.youtube.com/
                |atch?v=suoSGFSYoKQ).


                |I had sleep paralysis a couple times when I was a kid, I'd say I was around 8 or 9. Sometimes I saw what you ca
                |led the "sleep paralysis demon". I saw a girl that looked kind of like the ones that people spam about on Faceb
                |ok and stuff. Freaked the fuck out of me, especially since I had a sort of third person experience, but not com
                |letely. I could imagine, and sort of see myself sitting up and backing against the wall, but I didn't actually 
                |ove, I was just laying there, motionless. Then I woke up, turned on every light in my room, and waited to calm 
                |own. Eventually the paralysis stopped coming, and I was able to sleep once more.


                |When I had sleep paralysis there was my dad walking by my bed and he told me he was going to kill me and the re
                |t of my family. It was fucked up!


                |I have had sleep paralysis for as long as I can remember, but it got worse when I was around 18, and I still re
                |ember the night when it all got a lot worse.//I woke up late at night and my room was dark. I couldn't see much
                |and what I saw was blurry, but to my left right beside the bed there was a man. He was wearing a long, dark coa
                | and he held a knife. That's when I noticed that there was blood all around me and my intestines were lying on 
                |op of my stomach. In that moment I thought I was lying there dying while my murderer was standing right beside 
                |e, watching me dying.//I've seen "demons" too, but they weren't nearly as scary.


                |I experienced sleep paralysis my first time a few weeks ago and did see the demon. I had a friend sleeping over
                |across the room from me. I woke up but couldn't move. I was laying on my stomach and it felt as if something wa
                | pushing me into my bed and all I heard was the loudest buzzing in my head. I saw the shadow and felt it coming
                |over me as the pressure was added. It was horrible cause I tried reaching out to punch but couldn't move then t
                |ied shouting for my friend but only heard it in my head. The shadow was fully in front and over me when I final
                |y jolted myself up and was just out of breath. Didn't sleep the rest of the night and it was horribly scary.


                |I had it once as a kid and saw something.////It was obviously a dream, but my room looked exactly how it is at 
                |ight, and everything looked normal - but as I watched, one of my coats unhung itself from my closet and came ov
                |r to my bed.  I didn't (couldn't) move or say anything, so I just watched as it came over and reached across my
                |bed to me.  I slept on the top bunk at the time, so the sleeves just kind of... reached.////Pretty terrifying.


                |I get it maybe once a year. Worst part is I normally have nightmares and can convince myself they aren't real, 
                |ut this shit is way too convincing. Everything is totally normal except there's a completely invisible being ju
                |t holding you in place, like it's going to start choking you all of a sudden.////Then you wake up and can feel 
                |he sheer terror leaving your body.//


                |Not by my bed, but when I had sleep paralysis there was seething in my doorway. I just stared at while it slowl
                | drifted towards me and it looked like Slenderman except it didn't walk, it sort of floated. Scariest shit I've
                |ever experienced.


            |I've never had sleep paralysis before, but I've had the opposite happen - I was awake and could move but my eyes we
            |e crusted shut (I had eye problems as a kid =/) and my dream was still going in front of my eyes. It was terrifying


            |Pro-tip practice rolling out of bed visually(sensations) once in Sleep SP.//Then you can astral travel within Sleep
            |para at will, very fun to do! //And its easy, anyone can do. Full awareness within this state of being.  Done it pl

            |fuck sleep paralysis. fuck it. fuck it up its ass and every goddamn hole it has


            |Til this is a thing... I've had this plenty of times... I just would fight it til I could move... I would always im
            |gine scary things while it was happening.  


            |Huh.  I've experienced sleep paralysis a few times and it's never, ever bothered me.  Somehow, I knew what was actu
            |lly happening and that I was okay.


            |scariest thing i've ever experienced. things were moving by themselves and i saw shadows in the corner of my room. 
            | felt like something was standing over me as well. all i could do was breathe. i spent literally hours the next day
            |reading into it b/c it was so scary that i thought i had some kind of disorder. but then i realized i just had a fe
            | demons inside me. no biggie


            |This just happened to me recently.  It was freaky.


            |I've experienced it a few times, usually because I took a mid-afternoon nap. ////The only thing I could do was brea
            |he and move my eyes. If I tried to say something, it came out as a croak. ////If I was on the couch, I felt like so
            |eone was beside or behind me (even though there's no room for someone against the wall), hear someone calling or wh
            |spering my name, feeling someone touching me. I've had a few hallucinations, like a TV showing a bizarre commercial
            |one time.////At night, they're much scarier. Hearing my name called, seeing the door open and a shadowy figure stan
            |ing there, beckoning, but unable to move to go or get away.////The worst thing is knowing that you're awake and tha
            | this is happening. It seems supernatural. However, it's also the best thing because, once you know what this pheno
            |enon is you can reason because you're awake. It stops being scary since you know it's not real. You can relax or do
            |something to wake up all the way.


            |I have this all the time... not a big deal anymore, since every time I was able to break the paralysis with my will
            |ower after a minute or so. Yes I'm that awesome.//


            |Man I remember when I was like 6 years old, trying to get out of bed, but it was impossible, scariest moment ever


            |It's not that scary, especially considering your not awake enough to really get it when you try to move.


        |It's a medical condition called [Locked-in Syndrome] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked-in_syndrome). 


            |Reminds me of that story I read on reddit where the person went into surgery but instead of the anesthesia that kno
            |k you out they got the one that paralyzes you but leaves you fully conscious. They felt the whole operation but cou
            |dn't do a single thing to let the doctors know.


                |Although possible, this is an extremely rare event. We monitor signs such as heart rate and blood pressure as w
                |ll as knowing how much of what drug has been given (ie we commonly multiply the 'required' dose x 2-3 to make s
                |re a patient is asleep).////Even if a drug error occurs at the start of surgery (which is terrible enough in it
                |elf), it should not be perpetuated throughout the case, as no Anaesthetist would leave the kind of heart rate a
                |d blood pressure you would see in an awake, paralysed patient untreated, your body still 'screams' even if you 
                |an't.////Not denying what you describe has happened. In terms of risk though, you are more likely to be hit by 
                |ightning than undergo a complete surgical procedure whilst paralysed. 


                    |my brother said this happend to him (to a much lesser extent but still painful) when the anesthetic started
                    |wearing off partway through the procedure when he got his wisdom teeth removed


                        |Happened to me in the same instance. I remember hearing the dentist saying "This fucker wont come...out
                        |..oh there it is", and then i felt a sensation in my mouth..probably just the tooth falling out. After 
                        |hat i passed out again.


                            |Even with it not wearing off the feeling of getting your teeth pulled out is just fucking wrong...t
                            |ats the only way I can describe it :\ its like your body is screaming out that this shouldn't be ha
                            |pening


                                |That is because with our old pre-civilization non-flour-based diets, it never really happened. 
                                |We had no teeth at the start because we were fed by our mothers' breasts, we had our "baby teet
                                |" because our mouths were too small to hold standard teeth, and we had our "adult teeth" grow i
                                | when we started becoming fully grown.  Teeth falling out pretty much only happened because of 
                                |rauma (like a fist fight between humans, or a hunt-gone-wrong against a bear).

                        |I'm not gonna comment too much on that as I don't know much about it, but as far as I understood (she d

                        |They use general when it is a pretty serious emergency, and they have to get the baby out *right then*.
                        |If they've used general, there wasn't time to do a spinal block like they normally would have. So the e

                |That really happened? Really?


                    |It happened to my mom when I was born via c-section.  She said the worst part wasn't even the pain, it was

                    |I don't know how common it is now but I've heard of it a few times.  I remember this one woman who put all

                    |nurse spotted it and so they gave her more of the stuff that was paralysing her.  She was interviewed on tv
                    | she was very emotional about how hard it had been to move that toe, the trauma seemed to have deeply affec

                |My anatomy teacher was an anaesthesiologist and told us a story about his colleague anaesthesiologist having to
                |operate on a prisoner at the state pen.  As they were prepping, the prisoner was able to get his hands free for
                |a moment and he grabbed a nurse by the neck and started choking her.  The surgeon and the anaesthesiologist wer
                | able to stop him and restrain him.  He said that he then gave the prisoner the one drug to paralyze his body b
                |t waited to give him the other drug to knock him out.  While the prisoner was awake but paralyzed anaesthesiolo
                |ist was using the hand pump to give him breaths of oxygen but he would wait like nearly a minute between pumps 
                |nd in between he was whispering things into his ear and waiting until he could see panic in the mans eyes befor
                | giving him another breath.  Apparently before this surgery the nurses didn't really care for this particular a

            |In college I participated in experiments involving sensory deprivation chambers. You are in basically a casket fill
            |d with warm water, salt, and no light or sound whatsoever. Stimuli was introduced at different intervals prior to e

            |just watched a particularly gruesome CSI episode the night before.


                |They just opened a sensory deprivation tank clinic in Chicago. I can't wait to try it out.


            |Cremation is sounding damn good. You have to burn once, but at least you don't get stuck underground. 


            |There's a Stephen King short story almost about this. The guy was golfing and was bit by a snake. He woke up paraly

            |Great bit of writing, so kudos for that. But the part about feeling stuff is not exactly what the OP was talking ab
            |ut. In his version your body is fully dead, so you can't feel anything physically. Everything else there is spot-on

        |I read that theory somewhere else as well. Scary shit....cremation and throwig your ashes to the wind is thr way to go.


        |It's ideas like this that make me want to get cremated and have my ashes sent out to space. Then I can explore galaxies

        |And so getting taken out of your coffin once a year to get dressed into new clothes would be a great thing. 


        |There was a Tales from the Crypt episode where this happened and the guy goes through getting embalmed etc and he can't

                |a different story, as you say, amazing to just see a parallel to you, the same but different in so many ways!


                |I see it more as you getting to see every possible iteration of yourself. The guy who died at  20 in a crackhou

                    |&gt;In mathematics, a toroid is a doughnut-shaped object, such as an O-ring. It is a ring form of a solenoi
                    |. Its annular shape is generated by revolving a plane geometrical figure about an axis external to that fig
                    |re which is parallel to the plane of the figure and does not intersect the figure.[1] When a rectangle is r
                    |tated around an axis parallel to one of its edges, then a hollow cylinder (resembling a piece of straight p
                    |pe) is produced.////[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroid)

        |white? no, make that space black, but not just the color black. I just mean nothingness. True. Fucking. Nothingness. At
        |least with white you can have a sense of being, in complete nothingness you have a sense of...well...nothing, and don't

        |I had a sensation like this once, when I almost died. So with remembering that, here's a question that would make it or
        |break it for me: ////Do you still have the same feelings as when you're alive?//////When I experienced this, I was also
        |very removed from feeling anything that a normal person would feel. It's very hard to describe... It's not that I didn'
        | care about anything, but rather, everything was dull and behind me. It was... separate from me, something that no long
        |r exist but once was.////Ehh sorry to go all philosophical on you, but when I was in that state, I didn't mind what you
        |described. The white wasn't white, time wasn't time, nothing was everything but it was not nothing.////I like to think 
        |t was some sort of limbo where I went to, before it was decided that I was not to go forward (and die).

            |Actually there is a remote available, but all the buttons, including volume, channel, and power, do nothing but tur

        |Well, I'm done.


        |There is another person, although they can't see or hear or feel you, but you can see, hear, and feel them.  ////You no
        | only live in your own misery, but must watch the other person go crazy in their own misery.  Similarly there are lots 
        |f people on this plane, one of them can see you, but you don't know it, there's a huge circle of people connected by th
        | fact that they can't communicate with each other, and everyone only gets one person.


        |Winner.


        |This is pretty depressing. Why did I come to this thread?


        |How about you are always tired but cannot sleep and the plain is cold but you cannot die 


        |Well, the other person (let's call her Eve) not existing would suck, but assuming you don't know about the lie, we can 
        |igure this out and find her, eventually.  The first step is to break the infinite plane up into chunks and map it onto 
        | coordinate grid.  You need to be able to see the entire chunk from one location, so choose a relatively small size.  M
        |asure in paces and only ever turn in 90 degree increments.////Let's assume Eve isn't moving.  We'll get back to that.  
        |ou can search the grid one space at a time, starting at (0, 0) and working in an ever-expanding square. (1, 0), (1, 1),
        |(0, 1), (-1, 1), etc.  Eventually your square will expand enough to find her *if she's not moving.*////But what if she 
        |s moving?  Well, her velocity has X and Y values (just like her position).  So, let's search them in the same way.  For
        |values X, Y, V^x, V^y, first pick values where |X| + |Y| + |V^(x)| + |V^(y)| = 1.  For each value, go to where she woul
        | be if she had started at X and Y moving at that velocity.  If she isn't there when you get there, choose the next one.
        | Once you've searched all values summing to 1, bump the sum to 2 and keep going.////Eventually, assuming you can move s
        |ightly faster than Eve, you will find her.  It will take a long time, but hopefully having a purpose and having to reme
        |ber a ridiculous amount of information will stop you from going completely insane.


        |The other person is actually there, but that other person is Jayden Smith. You will instantly regret finding him. You w
        |ll then have to look at his forehead wrinkles for eternity.


        |I'd  just give up 21 times until I run out of hints and the voice tells me who it is. and he'd be like "sorry there's n
        | person and you lost 21 question" then it'd be over. 


        |I must assume you are an extrovert.  As a pretty solid introvert, I can say this doesnt sound so bad. There are times w
        |en I actually wish for a place like this.


    |More or less like this world, except all items come in [this](http://www.p-wholesale.com/upimg/17/144a1/plastic-packaging-9

        |That's not so bad, because the two pieces of plastic look like they come apart easily


            |Yeah...thats the ones that just pop open. You can even see where it has the two edges offset to make it easier to g
            |ab.////But i know the packaging he is talking about.


                |Yup, it's called clamshell packaging. Only a twisted mind could invent such thing.

            |You fucking wish!


            |That's because it's not yet heat-sealed.


            |.......*they never come apart.*


            |Yeah it's seems like maybe this one time it won't cut my hands when I open it. ////*cuts hands*//*cries*

        |o work for lunch?  A can of gravy, a loaf of bread and three roasted chicken breasts.  Silverware?  Fuck no.  He ripped
        |the chickens apart with his bare hands and made and ate at least a dozen sandwiches and ate all of them.  The remains w
        |re bones and an empty bread bag.  I could not be more than 10 feet away from him due to the room's size, and nobody wou
        |d relieve me because he was there and they could see what he was doing as they passed us in the hallway.  My supervisor

        |Yea this one is actually not that terrible. The fear of falling is that you will eventually hit the ground. If there is

                |Well, when most famous YouTuber's start a humble channel which gets a huge following once one video gets a lot 
                |f attention, in-the-millions attention, then their direction and reputation are on a very thin line since all o
                | their viewers are scrutinizing their every move.////It is at that point where people will take sides: one side
                |which says, "I've been with Pewdie since the beginning and I am a true fan," another side that says, "Well, I'm
                |here because I heard about this one video which was super-funny and I was curious about this guy's channel," an
                | the last side that says, "This guy isn't all that; his videos are shit, his entire fan-base are morons, and hi
                | jokes are tasteless and cheap."////However, this can happen with anybody who becomes famous; over-analyzing th
                |ir every move makes it easier to hate them *and* to dislike their entire fan-base.////I used to watch some of h
                |s videos and I thought they had their moments, but I can see how people can really get on his case because of t
                |e type of humor he has, his priorities leaning towards his income from YouTube/being YouTube famous over his fa
                |s/quality of his videos, and his over-exaggeration of everything that happens when he is playing a video game; 
                |ut it is really hard for me to judge. I don't know how it feels to gain such a huge following (regardless if hi
                | fans really watch his videos or not), get boatloads of money by doing something which seems so easy since you 
                |re essentially being yourself (*more* than yourself, if that makes sense), and in the process: to keep yourself
                |grounded, to be conscious of the consequences of your actions, and to simultaneously understand how people see 
                |ou and perceive you as a person/celebrity/entertainer/idol.////Even if he does not consider these things, then 
                |egardless it does not seem like he has done something scandalous towards somebody that is really worth the hate
                | (as far as I know...)////That's how I look at it, same thing happened to Tobuscus; I loved his Amnesia playthr
                |ughs because of his clueless behavior and witty jokes, but now with the facecam and shitload of content he has 
                |pewed out, I think the fame caught up with him too.


                    |Thing is though, one of the very few of his videos I've seen, he stated that he edits his videos due to fan
                    |feedback. I've also seen him bring back series that he clearly didn't really want to continue because the f
                    |ns asked him too. I totally agree by the way but jeez. People call his humor lazy and it really seems like 
                    |hat's his actual sense of humor. I think people just think he's faking it or something


                        |Another factor could be that people might be jealous of that fact that this guy makes money off of play
                        |ng video games and reacting to them accordingly; inherently that seems kind of unfair, but why should h
                        | complain? I certainly wouldn't.


        |I think I'm one of the few who likes him. But his fans are fucking awful.

                |No no. I know that. I meant on reddit. Most here seem to not like him. I should've worded that better.


                    |I mostly hate his voice and the way he uses it. "PEEWWWWWWWWWdiepie." Shut the FUCK up.


                        |Yeah I understand. I see him as a good way to get a couple laughs maybe and kill some time.

        |Pewdiepie doesn't annoy me that much. I think he's better than RoosterTeeth.


        |Now you're just getting redundant. 


        |Why does everyone hate him so much. I've only watched a few of his visa and it wasn't my cup of tea but he didn't seem 
        |hat bad. He was just very energetic.


            |So "energetic" now means "an annoying cunt who screams at the top of his lungs at everything". Good to know.

            |Well since you've been downvoted without explanation I guess I'll try my hand at it.////I don't like him because I 
            |eel he adds nothing to the game footage. I do not find him funny in the least. He seems like he's trying too much t
            | be funny and entertaining. It's like he makes jokes and stupid comments but doesn't have that natural charisma tha
            | lets him get away with it. He comes off as some teen kid who's just discovered cussing and rape jokes, and screams
            |like a little girl whenever the slightest thing happens.////I think it comes down to what people go to the videos f
            |r. I'm interested in the game, and he actually detracts from the game. He's slow to figure things out, and for the 
            |ost part doesn't even explain things. It's like watching senior citizens learn how to use a computer. It's painful 
            |nd you get nothing from it. ////Now those who want to see someone get "scared" (he's a poor actor), might find his 
            |ideos more appealing because they're not as interested in the game as they are in his reactions.////That's my best

    |Just death. I honestly don't know what to expect when I die, what I'll see, or how it'll feel like. What if I don't get to 
    |ee my loved ones because there's nothing afterwards? Or if I can see them grieving over my death, without being able to com
    |ort them by telling them we'll be together meet after they pass away? Heck, I would be happy if I could just talk directly 
    |o them after my death. It'd be like I'm there, and at least they'll be able to talk to me. Sometimes I'll get into some dee
    | thinking about it, and it makes me very frustrated and a bit depressed.


        |Expect nothing because that's what happens. You won't know you're dead. You'll just be dead. Your nervous system shuts 
        |own, your body stops and that is it. Nothing. Were you bothered by not being alive before you were born? I think not.


            |The moment of death doesn't bother me as much because I don't know how or when I'll die. It's what happens afterwar
            |s. However, if you're proposing that it'll be a feeling like before being born, you've changed my view of it a bit,
            |and I could go to the grave a bit more calmly. For that, I thank you.


                |There is nothing afterwards because there is no longer any "you". ////So, nothing to worry about. You'll never 
                |now you're dead.


        |Wait... so you want to be alive after you die... that doesn't make a lick of sense. What you're saying is that when you

            |Jesse Pinkman:** I took this vo-tech class in high school, woodworking. I took a lot of vo-tech classes, because it
            |was just big jerk-off, but this one time I had this teacher by the name of... Mr... Mr. Pike. I guess he was like a
            |Marine or something before he got old. He was hard hearing. My project for his class was to make this wooden box. Y
            |u know, like a small, just like a... like a box, you know, to put stuff in. So I wanted to get the thing done as fa
            |t as possible. I figured I could cut classes for the rest of the semester and he couldn't flunk me as long as I, yo
            | know, made the thing. So I finished it in a couple days. And it looked pretty lame, but it worked. You know, for p
            |tting in or whatnot. So when I showed it to Mr. Pike for my grade, he looked at it and said: "Is that the best you 
            |an do?" At first I thought to myself "Hell yeah, bitch. Now give me a D and shut up so I can go blaze one with my b
            |ys." I don't know. Maybe it was the way he said it, but... it was like he wasn't exactly saying it sucked. He was j
            |st asking me honestly, "Is that all you got?" And for some reason, I thought to myself: "Yeah, man, I can do better
            |" So I started from scratch. I made another, then another. And by the end of the semester, by like box number five,
            |I had built this thing. You should have seen it. It was insane. I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut with inla

        |People often make this argument about Heaven and Hell, about how if you're there for an eternity, you'd get bored. But 
        | disagree. That's lowly mortal-think. There's a line, I can't remember what it's from, but it goes "Eternity. I *know* 
        |hat this word means, but only now do I *understand* what it means."


            |If that means what I think it means then eternity trivializes my existence here. That is unacceptable. Only this un
            |verse is allowed to do that!


        |This is more like the classical version of Limbo, really.  Dante imagines that all the righteous Pagans were basically 
        |n a state that wasn't torture, like Hell, and wasn't great, like Heaven, and fully aware of this, they basically just w
        |ndered around a mostly empty area bored.  


        |*"I don't believe in an afterlife, so I don't have to spend my whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. Fo
        | whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse."*////-Isaac Asimov


        |As an Orthodox Christian what is taught about hell is that it's a state of being while perpetually living forever (no p
        |ysical torture or anything like that). A person in heaven and a person in hell can be located in the same physical plac
        | and both will be experiencing the presence of God. Of course, to the one in heaven the presence God will be refreshing
        |to him while to the person in hell God's presence will be miserable to him. 


            |But to me those are indistinguishable if they both last forever.


    |Being in a room with all of the people I've slept with at once.  


        |Is that a thinly-veiled brag? Or, like myself, would it be a pretty empty room?


            |haha it's not a brag... it would be a room full of alcoholic, passive aggressive, self righteous arses. But my deci

                |And then some of them start talking about how terrible you were.


                |Ahhhhh, that make sense. As a former passive-aggressive, self-righteous alcoholic, my condolences. I hope you'r

        |I dunno, I feel like my ability to just shut the fuck up would help me immensely in this situation. Let them fight it o
        |t if they choose. If they want to gang up on me, so long as it's verbal, I can take that kind of abuse all day. If it's

        |hell is suffering. you can't suffer if you don't exist. therefore nothingness ≠ hell


            |I think they meant existing in nothingness, like an eternal solitary with sense deprivation.  You would go insane, 
            |bviously.  (But what if even that didn't help?)


                |Ask the CIA for their experimental results if you must know.


                    |Wasn't there a sense dep thing in a Tom Clancy novel like this?  Russians floating someone in salt water so
                    |they even lost a sense of the spatial.////Then they had someone come on as "God," trying to crack them.


        |I'd take nothingness over the Christian ideology of hell. An eternity of just not existing, no awareness or consciousne
        |s... or an eternity of pain and suffering.


        |Doesn't seem so bad.  The idea of having thoughts for all eternity sounds way worse.  I'd rather just have everything e
        |d after a certain point.  I imagine after a certain amount of time you'll have thought every thought but then what?  


        |You've already experienced *nothing*. It was that time before you were born, and it didn't bother you very much, did it


        |Hell would be the absence of nothing. There is nothing but that doesn't matter because you don't exist. Ugh.


        |In very oversimplified terms this would be the Buddhist version of the afterlife post-enlightenment. No joy, no sadness
        | no rising, no ceasing, etc. 


        |&gt;*I'd* rather know something than *be* nothing.////Thing is, there is no "you" anymore. You can't "be nothing" becau
        |e there's no "you" to "be," there's no subject for that verb.////As Ayn Rand put it, from your perspective, you will ne
        |er die. The world will end.


        |I don't believe there is anything after death. To me, hell would be actually having an afterlife.


    |Eternal life/immortality. I already hate myself, and six years of stacking depression isn't helping. The ultimate hell woul
    | just be that, forever. A void of nothing but all my pent up negative emotions and self-loathing. And hey, immortality remo
    |es the easy way out. So that'd be that.////Unless it's like, you die anyways and then just come back. That could be fun to 
    |lay with for awhile, depending on how much of a mess you leave behind. 


        |This would be the most terrifying thing I could ever do.  Half the reason I've never tried to kill myself is that I kno
        | something else will take care of it for me some day.


        |Yea even if you're not depressed living forever would eventually suck, especially if you just kept getting older.


            |Watching family and loved ones die over and over would get a little dark, wouldn't it? You know what they say about
            |too much of a good thing. Extended life (if you aren't me)? Cool. Eternal life? Not so cool.


        |I feel that immortality would help me overcome my depression.////No longer do I have to worry about death, so I can do 
        |hatever I want, go wherever I want. I don't have to worry about wasting time because I had all the time in the world. /

        |Well, you could take the time to create a huge buisness and become a high political leader and monopolize the world. Yo

        |We got drugs, and booze, and religion. So there is a way out, albeit that it's true that those ways is pretty seedy and
        |nasty.


            |Funnily enough, I've already tried all three. Prescription anti-depressants (that are losing effectiveness by the d
            |y now). Alcohol works, kind of, but I have a severely obsessive personality. Engaging in that at all is going to ma
            |e me an alcoholic. Religion was nice. I looked over several and thought about the core-tenants and beliefs of a lot
            |of religions. I was always somewhat spiritual before, but that little "spark" of wonderment was slowly ground into 
            |othing over the years.

        |Would you preferred non-existence over say, a sort of heaven where your ''brain chemistry'' made it impossible to feel

            |Humans don't understand the concept of eternity. Infinity has no real meaning to us. I personally find it terrifyin

                | we cease existing forever.////I found his statement that "any sort of eternal afterlife is worse than not exis

                |can easily be overcomed in several ways when you dictate the scenario. But again, were just talking bullshit he


        |so your's would be if you woke up as a your 11 year old self on the first day of sixth grade ready to do life all over 
        |gain with the same mind set.


        |I disagree. I think a universe where anything and everything is possible would be the greatest fucking thing ever. Of c
        |urse heaven is just a human construct and nothing is what awaits, so don't worry.


        |That's sad :/


            |I dont see how. Eternity is terrifying. Think of the concept of FOREVER. No matter what it is it would be miserable
            |after a while. The things we do in this life only have impact and meaning because it will eventually end.


                |I believe in eternal glory so our views are different. I don't fear death because in my heart I know where I'll
                |be going where I die and I can't fathom how wonderful it will be. I respect your view and I'm not trying to "co
                |vert" you or anything that is just what I believe. My life on earth is meant to provide an example for The Lord
                |I believe in and that means loving everyone I come into contact with. That's why I'm saddened by a view of depr
                |ssing nothingness.


                    |Im not afraid of death either, because there will be no consciousness there to feel fear. ////Nothingness i

                    |.////Different people find comfort in different things.


                        |When I wasn't a Christian I feared death because I want to live as long as I can. I'm not saying that I
                        |am more loving than anyone else. I know many people who aren't Christians who are fantastic people. I g
                        |ess we do have different opinions but I know given the choice between being nothing and living forever 
                        |n complete happiness and peace, I know which one I would pick. Now I understand that's not how the deci
                        |ion works you either believe or don't believe or you don't really know. But from what I have experience
                        | in my life there is no way I can't believe in a Divine Creator. Those are my experiences though and I
