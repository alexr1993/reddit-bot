        |Smith Corona made a lot sexy portable typewriters. This model shown and [this](http://mytypewriter.com/ProductImages/Corona_Sterlin
        |_1940s_M.jpg) one are probably some of my favorite typewriters. Too bad working ones (not the junk you find on craigslist) are too 
        |xpensive for my ramen budget.////Another really nice looking one in my mind is the Remington Portables, such as [this](http://mytyp
        |writer.com/ProductImages/RE_Port_Noise_7_Matte_M.jpg) one. The 1930s-1940s produced some really nice machines. They kinda went to h
        |ll in the late 50s-60s though.

        |Back then you would have to use a lowercase "L" to free up some space for the hammers.

    |He mentions the crimson color, so probably the first one.

    |We must of been seconds apart, but I'll upvote the victor.

    |[I think it might be this one](https://www.smithcorona.com/blog/Virtual_Museum/1934LCSmith&amp;CoronaTypewritersInc.%238-14Silent.jpg) 
    |n that it carries the 'Silent' moniker referred to in the letter and dates to 1934.

        |[This ad also makes reference](http://www.thejumpingfrog.com/?page=shop/flypage&amp;product_id=858554) to both the 'Corona Silent' 
        |nd the 'L.C. Smith Silent'. The ad dates to 1934. The L.C. Smith in the previous post has a visible two color ribbon selector.
