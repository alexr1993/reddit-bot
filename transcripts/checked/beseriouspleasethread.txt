Amazing buildup to cat jump(/r/Videos)




    |I love it when cat's have botched jumps.


        |So much careful preparation just to fuck it all up and walk away like nothing happened.


            |Story of my life.


                |***hugs***


            |My cat will lash out at whatever is near if he balls up a jump. I like to imagine he is slapping the thing and sayi
            |g 'You threw me off, dickhead! Now I look stupid!'


            |Sounds like my first time.


            |Yeah but how synchronized can you be to Van Halen? That was the best part for me.


        |How about [corgis?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glii-kazad8)


            |that was pretty hilarious


            |Holy shit that caught me by surprise. I just let out one large "**HA!!**" and now my recently awoken wife is starin
            | daggers at me.

            |Kitty Corliss!


            |Ha, I'd only ever seen the gif of that.  So much better with the perfectly timed music.


            |Im sure I just woke up my neighbors laughing. . Thanks!


        |Psst, there is something wrong with your sentence.


        |Me too

        |haha looks like a montey python animation!


        |I've never seen it before. I thought it was hilarious.


            |I think bmw120k was saying 'here's a great post, now it's going to get recycled ad nauseum' rather than 'this is a

                |I think he was commenting on more of the subjects of cats being a easy and so often used of entertainment that 
                |t's lost novelty for him.


                    |I think it's a deep social commentary about the monopolization of the scuba gear industry and its direct co
                    |relation to the way people with ablinism are portrayed by modern media.


                        |Really? That's what you got? Normally, I'd agree with you, if it weren't for the colors reflecting a si

                    |e receving massive upvotes, it really seems to paint a clear picture of the ambient intelligence level.

                |I expect a gif version within 24 hours to be on the front page.


                |I thought he just meant that the cat that fell in the video fell into the karma machine...


                |You're not.

            |I'm always impressed with how well the song/beat matches up with the cat movements


                |The video editor intentionally slowed down/sped up some parts for it to fit. Watch the original without music a

                        | and down in time with the beat. I know the music isn't altered in any way.


                            |See the edited version of my comment. 


                        |oh god see the comment ont the original//http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Veg63B8ofnQ


                        |You don't have the full original there, so the part people are commenting on is not really something yo
                        | can comment on.


            |It's sad when a reposted video has double the views of the original upload...////This video of the cat set to that 
            |usic was originally posted under the title [Kitty Corliss "Grinding the Crack"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Veg6

                    |I couldn't anyway. I already like my job.

                |Well that itself is a repost, since the original video has no music.


            |Oh my god, that is straight out of a cartoon... especially the perfectly spread-eagle part, even the toes...


            |It was staring into my soul


        |I can't think of anything else that I want to yell at my cats when I see them perched on anything.

        |That's some Sun Tzu shit right there!


        |That thing radiates spite.


        |Yet, still the ball remains...


        |Is there a video to this?


    |That was so much funnier than expected. Laughed so hard I blew snot out of my nose and farted. 


        |it's okay we know you didn't actually.


            |STORY TIME////I had a cross between a Siamese cat and a wild cat, called her Clara and I loved her even though she 
            |as a nasty vicious wee bitch. She stalked and picked fights with seagulls for fucks sake!. I had it before I got ma
            |ried, and when my new wife moved in, she's the one that had to accept that there was already another women in my li
            |e. Clara lived on my knee in between killing things. One day, my new wife walked into the kitchen and the cat was o
            | top of the table, so she hit it a smack to get it down. Clara landed on the floor, composed herself, cleaned her f
            |ce a little... then launched a full on merciless attack on my poor unsuspecting wife, actually running up her body,
            |smacking her on the face several times, and eventually chasing her out of the kitchen. I laughed. Still do. The wif
            | actually cited the incident on our divorce papers. //Best cat I ever had.


                |I'd like to know more about the context of this story used on the divorce papers.


                    |there is a warning about posting personal information and getting me banned... I am afraid to go any furthe
                    | as I love this subreddit. If you want to know more about the succubus pm me. I'll give you her info and ma

                        |You call her a succubus then try to pimp her out. Do you hate random redditors or something?


                            |no. just that guy. I love you


                                |Awww shucks.


                        |You could give a run down of stuff without naming names, places, dates, or even specific information, a
                        |d I'm sure you would be fine.


                            |There's some fine women over at /r/CandidFashionPolice. Check it out.


                |Bro-cat used her bro senses to detect the bitch and diffuse the situation. Solid investment 


                |Alright


                |What does this have to do with a comment about things not actually happening?////Oh, wait.  Right.


                |Seen the word 'wee'. Read the rest in a Scottish accent.


                |If you put a siamese cat in the fridge for about a week it's fur turns black.


            |I want to believe. 


                |That would be pretty cool if it actually happened.


            |I actually did.  It was hilarious by itself!


                |I just pooped out a brick and then ate some dry wall////


                    |I literally died.


                    |I clawed my eyes out and threw myself repeatedly onto my back.


                        |I put on my robe and wizard hat.


                            |Squirt; I love you.


            |Actually, that's happened to me more than once. And each time there were people in the room. 


            |Made me laugh L)


            |I actually laughed.  If there had been snot in my nose some would have come out.  If there had been methane in my r
            |ctum some would have come out.


        |I farted out of my nose and blew snot out of my ass.

                    |I'm pretty sure you can use this gif for anything and still laugh.


            |Ew... Go see a doctor...


        |if there had been snot in my nose, I would have as well.


        |I can do both of those things without laughing.


        |I just exhaled slightly faster than usual.


        |Props to OP for a damn good title.


        |This was so much funnier than expected than I slightly raised my eyebrows.


        |Whoo hoo!  me too! I came to say I blew Mountain Dew out my nose all over phone.  


    |i love it when vertical camera is the right choice


        |Nope, still would have looked better in landscape


            |They were expecting the cat to jump higher than it did, though. Had it done so, portrait mode would have been prefe
            |able.


                |Standing back one step with landscape mode would be my personal preference, for both filming and watching.


            |I think it has artistic merit in this case.


        |portrait mode* camera is never the right choice for videos


        |Me too


            |Shhh.... get back to plundering...


    |I was like "I know whats gonna happen, this cat is gonna jump so high and flip or something" queue coughs up beer after wha
    | happens....


    |The music makes it.


        |And the giggle from the cinematographer. 


            |Does everyone who takes a video get a professional title now? 


                |You obviously don't realize how professional one must be to capture, on "film," a cat jumping.


                |I'm in LA.  That's how we roll.  


    |"Go ahead and jump, JUMP!" *weee*


    |[I like this one too](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awf45u6zrP0)


        |[This is my favorite.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDc_ZLZonkc)


            |Damn, that is a good one.


        |my favorite part about that video is that the music syncs with that cats movements////it goes BWAAAAAH when it puts its
        |head down or up from behind the laundry drying ////


    |Could not have trained an animal to hit the beat better than that.


    |In the 80's and early 90's my Dad was a trainer with the Orcas at SeaWorld. He was the guy doing the tricks with them in th
    | tanks. He used to do a show with this song and they'd jump out of the water at the sam time pushng my Dad high as fuck int
    | the air, wish I had a video of that other than VCR's.


    |[A cat,if can't jump higher, is nothing but a cat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_x9AUNPQ2Q)


    |Van Halen, good times.


        |I happened to play this song with my buddy last night on Guitar Hero, love the Van Halen edition of the game.


        |DAE know Van Halen?


    |Could this be the next Sail Cat?


        |I don't think the synchronicity of music/video will be matched to Sail Cat anytime soon. But this is a close 2nd imo.


            |The video was changed by slowing it down/speeding it up to match the cat to the song, sadly.


    |the gravity is strong with this one.


        |no the cat is white

        |Well, I was kind of expecting him to jump when DLR says jump, so in a way it was unexpected.


    |Too bad the YouTube title spoiled the surprise...


    |SAIL!


    |[Leopold the amazing leaping cat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeT8BahCXSQ)


    |My testicles hurt I laughed so hard.


    |Good thing it was jump. Come Sail Away would have seen that poor cat drown.


    |Her laugh is what I imagine stop girl'a laugh to sound like 


    |Oh wow I snorted


    |someone make it into a gif, when the cat falls out of the shot upvotes should splash out like he is falling into a ball-pit
    |of them.


    |Have you ever seen a mistake in nature?


    |Crappy orgasm if you ask me....


    |I would've been more than satisfied if the video just ended without the jump.

    |So worth the wait


    |BEST FUCKING THING I HAVE SEEN ALL DAY!!!!


    |All I could think of was how much wanted to stroke the fur down his/hers' front. So soft.


    |So inspirational that I now want to go to the gym and start training to be a cat. 


    |I laughed way more times rewatching that than I care to admit


    |Your cat is awesome, at least he/she tried. 


    |I usually downvote cat vids, but this was easily one of the best cat posts ever on Reddit. Upvote like a motherfucker. 


    |The fact that the music was actually being played en scene really made it for me. If it was added after the fact it wouldn'

    |Not amazing.  Not worthy of viewing time or discussion.  Sorry.


        |Too bad, you already wasted your time viewing it!

    |I was so ready to downvote this. Well played, OP, well played.


    |They can jump from why highr levels than that. They just have to be light and healthy. 


    |Downvote for vertical video


        |Downvoting because it's a vertical video of a vertical jump? Are you retarded or just don't understand how to chose ver

            |Downvote because instead of useing the phone camera in the horizontal orientation that video is ment to be in  dome
