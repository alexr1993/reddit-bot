TIL the CEO of Susan G. Komen for the Cure makes nearly $700K a year, about 25% more than other non-profits of comparible size, while only spending about 20% of its yearly funds on research for a cure for breast cancer.(/r/todayilearned)




    |And that's why I do not support that organization. 


        |People look at me like a monster when I tell them this, but it's a really shitty, exploitive organization. They're curr
        |ntly suing other charities that use the word "cure" and use pink ribbons. How charitable of them.


            |I don't even bother talking to people about this, I just nod and smile.


            |I can understand the pink ribbons, but how can anyone sue over the word cure? I can't imagine that they could win a
            |lawsuit over the word cure. 


                |Crazier things have happened, like Apple with rounded squares, or the letter of the alphabet i.


                    |True, but I can definitely see the "i" thing. Putting I in front of words is something that you associate w
                    |th Apple. It's not the letter "i" itself, it's putting it at the beginning of a word. If a company came out
                    |with an icar people would definitely think it was from Apple and that company might benefit and if it was a
                    |piece of shit it could hurt Apple's reputation. The rounded corners thing is total bullshit though because 
                    |t's the obvious way to make a phone. Were other companies supposed to use triangular phones with razor shar
                    | corners or something? 


        |Crazy to think that it's also one of the *most* trusted non-profits out there...


            |You'd be surprised how little of the money people raise for breast cancer goes towards anything research or treatme
            |t related.


                |Rule of thumb: If somebody's raising money for "awareness," you're not supporting anyone but the organization./
                |//If a group doesn't specify where the money is going, red flag.  


                    |I think that most people are already aware of breast cancer. What we really need is money to go into resear
                    |h. 


                        |We need money going into cause as well as cure, as the pink ribbons documentary advocates.


                        |That's the problem with awareness campaigns.  People become aware of the disease and think they've done
                        |their good deed for the day...


                |Doesn't surprise me at all. As someone who has gone through cancer though, it sickens me.


                    |We should start our own fundraising foundation... With financial aid and responsible spending of revenue!


                        |Plus, like $600K a year.////Fucking score.

                |It's not about being aware of Breast cancer as in, Oh there's breast cancer. It's about encouraging people to g

                |k ups for both testicular and prostate cancer, however, the rate of breast cancer is far higher being 1 in 8 wo

            |From what I heard, the reason why awareness campaigns are more prevalent for breast cancer is due to a higher survi
            |al rate than many others, so the victims are able to advocate and bring more "awareness."  


            |I hate to play devil's advocate here, but surely you realize how simplistic you're being right? It's much bigger th
            |n announcing that breast cancer exists. It's making sure people know what to look for, how often to get checked, et
            |...


            |Who pays for those ads and commercials? 


                |Tthe people who donate to the charity.


        |It's not about informing the public about breast cancer, it's about reminding them that the risk is there. If you are r
        |minded, you may be more likely to schedule a mammogram. Breast cancer can be discovered with a simple test that you can
        |do at home, so if there are a lot of reminders, more people may discover the cancer earlier. ////I have many, many issu
        |s with the Komen foundation and the Save the Boobies campaign, but I understand the importance  of spreading awareness.


            |Exactly. The local hospitals in my area use October as an education opportunity. They do reduced cost mammograms, e
            |ucate about self checks, etc. Obviously everyone knows breast cancer exists, but no one expects it to happen to the
            |. The awareness campaigns are about reminding people that it can. 


            |Then raise awareness about skin, colon, or lung cancer, each of them kill more people than breast cancer does. Yet,
            |breast cancer gets like 50x the funding of those other cancers.////I never understood why everyone is so willing to
            |support breast cancer. I love tits as much as the next guy, but god damn people, stop with all the breast cancer sh
            |t and start talking about the cancers that are actually killing people left and right.


                |Well, breast cancer still kills many people, men and women alike. There are also awareness campaigns for other 
                |ancers as well. There are many resources available to you if you would like to know more about these programs a
                |d events. 


                |No one is stopping you from starting a charity related to the cancer of your choice.  But you just rather bitch
                |about what other people do than actually do something yourself. 


        |Cancer? Tell me more, this is the first time I'm hearing about this 'cancer.'


            |what i do know about cancer is that everyone is aware. Uncomfortably and hyper-actively aware.Everyone except the m
            |n who don't know they can get breast cancer. I'm thinking it's time this Susan G. Komen sits her pretty little ass

            |Which gain more money for breast cancer.////Spending 20% of 100 million is a lot better than 90% of 1 million. 


        |Bit weird to call themselves "for the cure" then. Raising awareness of the need to raise funds for the cure, by solicit

            |As a person who buys smokes from Walgreens semi-frequently, the "Be well" from the cashier always gave me a chuckle

            | I left my items on the counter and walked out. 


        |And even once you decline it on the debit card or credit card terminal the cashier asks you again. I love places that t

        |I'd be supremely pissed off if I saw that at a checkout. Companies directly take the money themselves and then donate t

    |Seems like they spend most of their money on advertising

    |The CEO earning that much I don't necessarily have a problem with, like in any business a good CEO is crucial. If paying $7

    |a good job.////Edit: I'm also curious about the 20% figure and how bad that really is. If spending a lot on marketing and a
    |areness causes their funding to dramatically rise that would be a good thing. 20% of a larger number could potentially be m

                    |But they do. That's the thing. They have to turn in profit, even being a "non-profit", they are a business.
                    |They provide a service. That's like saying a massage company can't turn profit because they don't make a pr
                    |duct. If non-profit had to work with a different set of rules, they would lose. Why, as a CEO, would you pr
                    |fer working for a breast cancer awareness over Google? At the end of the day, salary moves great CEO's to o
                    | away from your company, and profits make or destroy any company. On a NPO, they can use more for "the good
                    |stuff".


                    |So you think all of Silicon Valley should not have a CEO? 1813 called, they want your line of thinking back


            |Well, a quick look through his comment history suggest he really is that rich. But regardless I don't see what that

                |I'm not the NSA, so...


        |As a non-American, it humors me to see you say that you're fine with CEOs being paid such disgusting amounts, especiall
        | when they are often part of other companies and such as well. ////This is part of why the divide in the US is so big, 
        |eople think it's normal.


            |I've lived half my life abroad, and don't give me that "as a non American" bullshit. Plenty in people in Europe, As

            | the limit goes, what's the arbitrary limit that constitutes whether it's disgusting or not).////You are right thou
            |h that CEO pay in America is proportionally higher than most places in the world. And I'll be the first to admit th
            |t many of them don't deserve a fraction of what they are paid. But I'll also be the person to argue for days that s
            |me of them absolutely deserve it. It's simple economics really, a good CEO may make or break a company and either b
            |ing in millions more in profit or loose millions. And since there are only a handful of people qualified to do that
            |their pay will naturally be high. ////I don't have as much of a problem with high salaries as I do with the lack of
            |responsibility. Part of why they are paid so handsomely is because they are supposed to be held accountable if anyt
            |ing goes wrong. But nowadays that doesn't seem to be happening.


            |Yeah because CEO's all over the world have comparable incomes....


        |CEO is another word for 'I will take all the money and power I can, as well as lie and manipulate others into keeping m
        | in the position that I do not deserve.'


            |Have you ever dabbled in business? CEOs are built not to give a fuck. You hire them to do one job, and the better t
            |ey are, the more you usually pay.////As a shareholder, you're thankful to have them.


            |Ahh yes, the typical redditor who thinks running a multinational corporation with thousands of employees is easy co
            |es out of the woodwork. ////Debates about the gap between CEO/management salaries on one side and "normal" employee
            | on the other side is absolutely worthwhile. Statements like yours just shows how little you know about the real wo
            |ld.


            |Is that what you think a CEO does? Jesus you're so stupid you bling on /r/politics


    |There was also a report of this org suing other charities who used "for the cure" in their names or promotions. Lawyer scum
    |makes money that could be used for research. 


    |I work in nonprofit development, and I have some opinions about this.////"Overhead" seems to have become a dirty word in no
    |-profits.  We are expected to deliver high-quality, vital services and to spend very little money to do it.  However, you c
    |n't judge the effectiveness or integrity of a non-profit based on what percentage of their funding goes to overhead or how 
    |uch their CEO makes.  ////I guarantee you the CEO of Susan G. Komen could be making *much* more money a year with her skill
    |et and experience.  Compensating a CEO realistically is the only way to get CEO type people to work for you.////Furthermore
    | an organized fundraising team costs money to maintain.  That seems counterintuitive, and a lot of nonprofits are wary of f
    |nneling money back into fundraising because it feels a little icky, but  if you spend $1,000,000 to raise $1,500,000 (only 
    |3% goes to providing service) as opposed to $50,000 to raise $300,000 (~85% (dammit man, I'm a fundraiser, not a mathemetic
    |an!) goes to providing services) you're still providing more services even though your overhead is higher and you're doing 
    |t less "efficiently".////Also, it's boobies.  Everyone loves boobies.


    |Pink is a massive scam. Breast cancer awareness is well beyond it's saturation point. At this point, companies like Yoplait
    |and the NFL just use it to make money.


        |You're right about Yoplait, but the NFL uses the American Cancer Society.


    |That is a lot of profit for a non-profit organization!  How do I start one?


    |I stopped making donations. It's a scam industry.


    |That's why it's a 2 star on charity navigator.  Not a good charity.


    |Did you know they copyrighted the phrase "for the cure?" They have actually sued smaller organizations for using it.////Sou
    |ce: http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/suing_for_the_cure


    |I brought up why I don't donate to charities unless I can directly support... i.e. women's shelters (you can pretty much do
    |direct donations, same with most animal shelters) and I used this as an example, and people thought I was some heartless bi
    |ch and downvoted me.////You know there are other, direct, approaches to donating to a cause. This isn't the only cancer or 
    |ven breast cancer research out there.////Many of the African charities are the same way. It saddens the hell out of me.////
    |/The other corporate shit show is United Way.////Another edit: basically when I worked for UPS it was almost mandatory to d
    |nate to United Way. Our HR rep would stand there and watch us fill out the forms even if it was a dollar off the paycheck W

    | walk to work so she was NEVER late.////Her deluded idea of emergencies and issues and other such reasons for "LIFE" were a
    |lost cause on her. ////I fucking hated that woman... and I hate that charity more BECAUSE of her.


    |Not saying that this isn't completely shady, but how much of that money is used to advertise and to run events that help to
    |promote awareness and gather more donations?


    |As someone with stage iv breast cancer, I get so pissed every time I see a stupid ass pink ribbon on anything. But try expl
    |ining why to someone and they will argue with you. Komen has done an amazing job with their brainwashing.


    |There is nothing "non-profit" about 503c non profit groups.


        |Go on. Please tell us more.


            |503c "non-profit" orgs are designed to profit everyone but the org.  They can pay employees any salary they like as
            |long as their board of directors votes and approves it.////It is a sham, as it is used more often than not as a tax
            |shelter by tax-cheats who don't think they should pay their fair share.  Having worked for several, I've seen the c
            |rruption first hand.////Susan G. Komen is just the poster child of the corrupt "non-profit" scheme.


                |Well, can't argue with that.


    |All aboard the Komen-rage karma train!  Choo choo!


    |Even though this seems like a ridiculous salary, the president of the "Breast Cancer Research Foundation" makes more.////ht
    |p://www.charitywatch.org/hottopics/Top25.html////It's at the bottom.


        |That's interesting. ////I regularly donate to BCRF based on 91% of their donations going to research/awareness campaign
        |. Other sites have praised them as a very reputable charity.////I'll continue to donate, but with a more cautious attit


        |But doesn't the BCRF give 90% of its earnings to research and/or their programs? 


    |The store I work in is currently "pinkwashing" everything. I'm required to make announcements every thirty minutes about ho
    | we're "supporting a GREAT cause!" and all that, so buy these cookies! It makes me sick.


    |Because it's a marketing organization that calls itself a charity to gain tax exempt status. 


    |My mom is a breast cancer survivor, and is totally against Susan G. Komen. ////Try the Breast Cancer Fund if you're looking
    |to make a donation :)//


    |Good to see people finally realizing this. I do not wear pink ribbons or do anything to promote this *corporation*. It's a 
    |ham, and more people need to research where their money is actually going instead of blindly donating to feel good. 


        |They don't advertise to finding a cure they advertise to awareness. Regardless of what you or I think about spending th
        |t much money on awareness, it's certainly not a sham as they're very upfront about their focus being on awareness not a
        |cure.


            |"For the Cure" seems pretty misleading then. It's broad enough that they can weasel their way out of it when backed
            |into a corner, but the phrase taken at face value is enough for most people to throw money at it.

    |I started checking up on charities a couple years ago via Guidestar.org and its sad how few of them are really charitable a
    | all. Susan G. Komen ranks pretty high up there for terribleness.


        |How so?


    |Just so that reads this comment is aware, non-profit companies do not "lose money" or "break even"--they are called non-pro
    |its because they do not pay out dividends on stock.//////Yes, we should probably call them something besides "non-profit."


    |living in Columbus, Ohio it is nothing but Breast Cancer fundraising propaganda, after another. How much fucking money do t
    |ey need? I'm not trying to sound ignorant, but honestly they have been raising hundreds of millions a year and yet to never
    |find cures or tell the public about where the money goes to. 


    |I've honestly had major problems, yes lets promote boob cancer but you NEVER hear anything about prostate or testicular can
    |er.


    |It's a fucking scam!!!!!


    |While I think 20% is pretty low, you have to ask yourself what a reasonable percentage is.  I would say 40% of donations to
    |the cause is a good number. ////What good is a charity if they don't have marketing (to expand awareness and donations)  an
    | top tier talent?   They're a glorified bake sale if they don't spend money on expanding their business. ////As for the ceo
    |of a charity making $700k/yr?  I have no problem with people getting rich by helping others.  As for Komen for the Cure *in
    |particular*...  I'm not a fan of their litigiousness. 


        |When there are other large and well-known non-profits giving 90%, there's absolutely no excuse for this.


            |Rhetorical question, but it is a question that needs to be asked. Why are there so many groups to begin with? Do we
            |really need 100 breast cancer groups? Is it like TV news and everyone wants to be the first to report on a breaking
            |story? Maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about, but why not poll all the groups together? Oh, that's right, 
            |oney. The same reason if we ever do find a cure for cancer, it's going to break the bank for anyone who isn't alrea
            |y rich.


                |I've always wondered why we don't have any testicle or prostate cancer societies getting the scale of publicity
                |and outreach that all the breast cancer societies are getting.


                    |Who wants to look at testicles and prostates all day?


                        |your mom.


            |Exactly, it's pathetic that a lot of people take advantage of the non-profit status. Non-profits are meant to be ru
            | like a business, not to let people be paid like business people. That's why I don't donate to the United Way and o
            |her organizations that pay large for people to be CEO/President.


            |Did you bother to see they give around 80% to the cause, 10% for fundraising and 10% administrative. Stop spreading
            |lies.


                |When you call yourself "For The Cure" (and legally fight other non-profits for using that term btw) and only sp
                |nd 20% *actually* looking for that cure...////Also you need reading comprehension. Reread the title and tell me
                |where I lied.


                    |So misinformation is not lies? That title is misleading because anyone that doesn't know what he is talking
                    |about will just think "When you call yourself "For The Cure" (and legally fight other non-profits for using
                    |that term btw) and only spend 20% actually looking for that cure..." and start donating to little time fund
                    |aisings that doesn't even compare to a 1% of that 20%, reducing the multiplicative value of the donation an
                    | hurting women everywhere.


            |Exactly.   Large and well known.  How does a new non-profit become large and well known? 


                |Susan G. Komen for the Cure *is* large and well known. 20% is deplorable.


                    |And did I not say that Komen for the Cure was objectionable both from the low 20% figure and their litigiou
                    |ness? 


        |I think enough clout to get the NFL to confuse everybody by changing the color of penalty flags is probably big enough.


        |&gt; As for the ceo of a charity making $700k/yr? I have no problem with people getting rich by helping others.////Are 
        |ou serious?  Why the hell not? Charity is not something it is possible to get rich doing.  If you're getting rich, you 
        |ren't running a charity, you're running a business and people certainly shouldn't just be giving you free money and you
        |should not be tax exempt.


            |Why would he not be serious? It's not easy to find someone capable of handling over 100,000 employees/volunteers an
            | hundreds of millions of dollars. Anywhere on the private market being responsible for that much would net you well
            |into the millions and just because you're a non profit doesn't mean you don't need the same talent. They have to pa
            | that much to get the talent required and for the talent that is required, it's still significantly less than they 
            |ould get anywhere else doing the same thing.


                |The market value of something is not necessarily correlated with how useful that thing actually is.


            |Playing devil's advocate here, but why not make running a charity a way to get rich? Think of all the bright, intel
            |igent people how would love to go into nonprofit work, but are dissuaded by the lack of money. At my school, there 
            |re tons of people who are no less charitable than anyone else, but for perfectly legitimate financial reasons choos
            | to go into finance or consulting instead of nonprofits. Just think, if those career paths had comparable pay, how 
            |any incredibly smart people would choose charity work. By not giving an incentive, however, nonprofits lose a lot o
            | potential brainpower. 


                |&gt;At my school, there are tons of people who are no less charitable than anyone else, but for perfectly legit

                |ns objectively show that they aren't.  People do choose to operate and work for non-profits, so clearly those p

            |Why is it acceptable to make millions by making cigarettes,  guns,  video games and countless other things we consi
            |er to be moral vices...  But the second someone wants to make money doing something generally good for humanity,  w
            | try to crucify them? 


                |I'm not sure where you got the idea that I think it's acceptable to become rich making any of those things.  I'
                | not suggesting that people shouldn't make money doing things that have a positive impact on the lives of other

            |Couldn't agree more. Doubleplus upvote.


        |How about a reasonable percentage being 100%? She should donate her time free of charge - it used to be called "volunte

            |Wow, good luck recruiting qualified individuals with that attitude.


                |Oh, I think it would be rather difficult to find any individuals who could not perform better than her 20% dona

                |claim a $700k annual paycheck with a straight face.


                    |Well let's clarify one thing.  Susan G. Komen's purpose is not to forward money to breast cancer research (
                    |lthough they do).  It's purpose is to do everything in their power to raise breast cancer awareness, which 
                    |as shifted in recent years to making sure people are proactive in ensuring they do not have the disease and
                    |if they do, to get it looked at and treated early on instead of later.  In this regard, Susan G. Komen spen
                    |s almost 80% of their total revenue on programs specifically designed to further this purpose.  For example
                    | they spend ~130 million dollars a year on awareness, another 75 on research, and ~50 on screening and othe
                    | preventative measures.  They spend more money per year and a significantly high percentage on things that 
                    |ave made a tangible difference in the fight on breast cancer.  ////And you ask what qualifications does som
                    |one need to do have to do charitable work?  None, absolutely none.  But you're not asking someone to do cha
                    |itable work.  You're asking someone to be CEO of a 400 million dollar a year not-for-profit that has thousa
                    |ds of employees.  You can't grab a guy off the street and expect him to run that large of an organization w
                    |ll.  Not only that, but the goal of every not-for-profit should be to expand.  If you keep their spending h
                    |bits the same, doubling SGK's annual revenue from ~400 million to 800 million means twice as much money for
                    |research, screenings, and education than before.  You also allow the company room to grow and, hopefully, c
                    |ntinue growing so they can provide their services to more people.  You're asking someone to do the job of a
                    |highly talented businessman for nothing and, in effect, telling them they have to sacrifice their ability t
                    | provide for their family.  Why?  Do people, all of a sudden, not like to be paid?  Should the researchers 
                    |ho actually do the scientific research into a cure not be paid because they should just "want" to do it?  Y
                    |u're literally telling someone to choose their family's well-being over doing some good in the world and I 
                    |ind fault with forcing someone to choose that.


                        |I think you're missing the point. Charitable work should be just that ; charitable. It should be volunt
                        |ry, unpaid and the reward should be the charitable work itself. You speak about the charities' main foc
                        |s being to raise awareness of this cancer, and that is it's raison d'etre. What woman doesn't know abou
                        | breast cancer? Name me a single woman that you know who needs their "awareness raised". This charity e
                        |ists to make money on the back of womans' fear of breast cancer - how despicable can you get? It is the
                        |job of publicly funded agencies to educate people about the risks of cancer - and this is something the
                        | do well already. You say they have made a "tangible difference in the fight on breast cancer" - what e
                        |idence do you have for that statement? It is well known that breast screening programmes are very bad f
                        |r public health, a recent British study found that for every one woman that had some form of cancer det
                        |cted 3 women were treated unnecessarily. That's a bad hit rate. And all this "awareness raising" so cal
                        |ed charity is doing is to feed as many women as it can scare into the medical system.////It stinks.


                            |And I think you're missing the point:  You're expecting thousands of people to get no pay, no benef
                            |t from helping people.  To literally live in poverty as they help others.  That's not only unfair, 
                            |ut hurts the recruitment of talent that can actually build these charities well.  You're missing ou
                            | on the most qualified candidates because you can't competitively pay them (and I'm sorry, but most
                            |people refuse to sacrifice the well being of their families).////And like I said, awareness is now 
                            |ocused on making sure that women not only KNOW about breast cancer but also act on it and get preve

    |OP should proof read his titles.


    |Money doesn't buy cure.////After all these years....


    |Thats just the tip of it too. I live by their headquarters for the Seattle area and it takes up an entire huge victorian bu

    |That's why I never donate to any of those things.  They don't do much at all.  It's a scam.

    |Quite a racket, innit?


    |Why can't the head of a successful charity be rewarded for doing a good job? If I raise $5,000,000 and contribute $1,000,00
    | because I need to spend a lot on infrastructure, overhead, advertising, salaries, etc., I don't feel like there's anything
    |wrong with that. High volume has its cost.

            |When was the last time you were able to raise millions of dollars for a charity, you dunce?


    |Dirty business with that organization. I refuse to support them in any fashion, Path to the Cure gets my donations now.


    |Welcome to the scam that is "awareness"


    |Damn I just bought their flowers yesterday. To try and get my ex girlfriend back. ////It worked so. 


    |http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong.html


    |That's a really sleazy organization. So many "nonprofit" organizations do this. I would love to know of some that are actua
    |ly honest and keep up that nonprofit ideal.


    |My sister was a sorority sister to Susan G. Komen's niece. Said she was a spoiled princess whose family made a ton of money
    |from their foundation. So, yeah, I believe this.


    |Susan as a national organization is not the place to donate to breast cancer research. It's not even the place for breast p
    |tient support. They are a hard core lobby group that once was small and effective to boost issues but are political sharks 
    |ow. Donate instead to local Komen chapters directly as thy get little from the national group. Also look to Gilda's Clubs a
    | well as Breast Cancer Research.  


    |Is there anything that can be done about that?


    |One of it's primary objectives is to raise awareness.


    |It's awful because the flood of everything pink/ribbon has completely turned me off breast cancer donation.  Susan B. is a 
    |errible organization.


    |What blows my mind is that pediatric cancer receives a fraction of the funding that breast cancer (and other adult cancers)
    |receives. They do tonnes of fund raising for breast cancer research.


    |It is also crucial to note that the Komen Foundation also limits its funding to the search for cure instead of the search f
    |r the underlying physical, environmental and social factors that may be causing breast cancer like exposure to plastics and
    |other synthetic materials. This is not saying that a cure is not important but a cure would not be necessary if breast canc
    |r could be prevented before it started.


    |It's not about the percentage of their donations given or taken. It's about the total amount given from their donations.


    |This is why I don't support any charity, and give directly


    |There is no money in curing cancer or diseases, there is however money in researching for "cures" and maybe developing drug
    | that lessens the effects and keeps people alive as long as they can afford to pay for the said drugs.


    |Most of the breast cancer marketing is bizarre. It's more about protecting boobs than the person. All the bras displayed ev
    |rywhere piss me off for all the women who had to get mastectomies to save themselves, not their "tatas." ////My mother died
    |of colon cancer 3 years ago, and I've never found a shit brown (not kidding. That's the color for colon cancer) ribbon in t

    |I learn this fact something like three times a day. Thanks reddit!


    |I love Susan G.Komen Foundation as much as the next person on Reddit but understand this before a bunch of you get your pan
    |ies in a twist about them spending "Only" 20% on Research////From Wiki "Komen reported approximately US $360 million in exp
    |nses. $283.2 million of this went towards program services: $75.4 million (20.9 percent of total expenditure) went to resea
    |ch, $140.8 million (39.1 percent) went to public health education, $46.9 million (13 percent) went to health screening serv
    |ces, and $20.1 million (5.6 percent) went to treatment services. The other $76.8 million went to supporting services, inclu
    |ing $36.1 million (10 percent of total expenditure) toward fund-raising costs and $40.6 million (11.3 percent) toward gener
    |l and administrative costs."////You Can complain about percentages all you want but $75.4 Million is a whole lot of money.


        |But about the CEO salary..... yeah thats sick. but thats America for ya


    |WHAT A SURPRISE. 


    |They also make it nearly impossible for people with breast cancer to get any sort of aid or help. Also they repeatedly ask 
    |y mother you has gone broke from breast cancer to donate to them.


    |Why sugar, it's more fun to raise money by having parties. 


    |And this is why, as Penn Jillette pointed out in his BS! episode, that more "awareness" campaigns such as this are, well, B
    |! Why raise awareness when we should be focusing on raising money to fund a cure?


    |And Bono's One Foundation only paid 1 percent of its donations to help the poor.


    |So, Susan G Komen is almost kind of a cancer to the actual cure for cancer???

    | were so popular people were buying up all they could and selling them for huge profits on ebay.


    |We get it, they're the devil. 


    |So, does non-profit now simply mean "Shit, we've earned money. Better put this extra in my own bank account"?


    |Ive always knew that breast cancer was a money-making scheme. The way it is marketed is like an actual product. Its everywh
    |re.////Also the best part about cancer research is that you can take in millions of dollars and you don't have to do the re
    |earch because it is something of a miracle cure. We don't know if we will ever be able to cure it.////Non-Profit is a trick
    | word though. It simply means that the company doesn't hold onto its money, the owners hold onto the money and if the non-p
    |ofit needs money they will pay out of pocket.////You would think it would be a real non-profit in which every penny they ma
    |e goes right back into finding a cure or whatever they are doing. However, employees can't just volunteer, they need money 
    |o live just like everybody else, and this is the major loophole where the employees can make a lot of money. All profits ju
    |t get sent home with the employees.

    |They have no interest in finding a cure because, if we did, they'd be out of a job. It's about treatment to them, and it ke
    |ps them making money. 


    |This is just wrong in every way. Can we do something about this, reddit?


    |i always run in their 5k.  I have no problem with CEO's of non profits making a bit, but the size thing bothers me.

    |/#!/entry/susan-g-komen-ceo-salary-up-64-percent-as-charity,51b633c2da27f5d9d0dc669c


    |So, if a non-profit can write a check to support research, why can't regular people?  If I don't want to go through an orga
    |ization to donate, how can I find the individuals that are doing the work that I want to support?


    |Judge Posner came up with a really interesting solution to this problem: require charities to spend down all of their funds
    | thereby forcing them to appeal continually for new donations.////&gt;Even when no unforeseen contingencies materialize, pe
    |petual charitable gifts raise an economic issue that echoes the concern with the separation of ownership and control in the
    |modern business corporation. A charitable foundation that enjoys a substantial income, in perpetuity, from its original end
    |wment does not compete in any product market or in the capital markets and has no stockholders or other owners. Its board o
    | trustees is self-perpetuating and is accountable to no one for the performance of the enterprise. (Although state attorney
    | general have legal authority over the administration of charitable trusts, it is largely formal.) And as neither the trust
    |es nor the staff have the kind of property right in the foundation’s assets or income that would give them a strong incenti
    |e to maximize value, the carrot is missing along with the stick.////&gt;The incentives to efficient management of foundatio
    | assets could be strengthened by a rule requiring charitable foundations to distribute every gift received, principal and i
    |terest, including the original endowment, within a short, specified period of years. The foundation would not be required t
    | wind up its operations within the period; it could continue indefinitely. But it would have to receive new gifts from time
    |to time in order to avoid exhausting all of its funds. Since donors are unlikely to give money to an enterprise known to be
    |slack, the necessity of returning periodically to the market for charitable donations would give trustees and managers of c
    |aritable foundations an incentive they now lack to conduct a tight operation. Foundations—mostly religious and educational—
    |hat market their services or depend on continuing charitable support, and are therefore already subject to some competitive
    |constraints, could be exempted from the exhaustion rule.//////&gt;The objections to the suggested rule are that it is unnec
    |ssary—donors are already free to limit the duration of their charitable bequests—and that it might therefore … reduce the i
    |centives to make charitable gifts. A counterargument is that many perpetual foundations were established at a time when the
    |foundation was a novel institution. A person creating one at that time may not have been able to foresee the problem of ine
    |ficient and unresponsive management that might plague a perpetual foundation as a result of the peculiar set of constraints
    |(or rather lack of constraints) under which they operate.


    |Remember when the old CEO tried to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood?////Pepperidge Farms remembers:http://www.huffing
    |onpost.com/tag/susan-g-komen-planned-parenthood////Little switcharoo at the CEO spot, a little apology and all of a sudden 
    |eople forget.


    |Support breast cancer research! Read the small wording under the donation cans everywhere, most read "donations are capped 
    |t x$" where x is usually equal to a low dollar figure and the company putting out the donation jar will benefit from every 
    |ollar after x donations. It's a scam and nothing, and I mean nothing makes me laugh more than seeing all the misinformed pa
    |ns running around "for the cure". 


    |and yet, they've spent almost 2 billion dollars around the world for education, advocacy and health services.

    |Why don't we get the pitchforks and torches out more often against this organization?


    |see Pink Ribbons inc. documentary still on netflix i think


    |20% is a decent amount going to the actual cause compared to most charities. I read somewhere that the average is around 10
    | for majority of charities need to find the source once I get off work.


    |And this is why there is no cure for cancer.


    |So fuck pink?


    |That's cause all charities are bullshit. They just use the money to promote the charity more. Even Worldvision is a scam.


    |I would be surprised if they contributed 20%. I seem to remember something, and this may be about 5 years dated, but at one
    |point almost none of their money went to research. It goes to "awareness" which is bullshit, everybody knows about cancer.

    |Regardless of whether or not a nonprofit is doing what it set out to do (solve problems, provide aid, etc.), punishing nonp

    |disasters- only preparation and recovery. Dollars should indeed go directly to their cause. However, for organizations that

    |from getting closer to real, lasting solutions. ////Why do we pay CEOs top dollar to run companies that solve no serious so

    |If a large charity receives 1 million dollars and donates 20%, thats $200,000 for the cause. However if a smaller charity r

    |y without advertising, and paying workers. ////Why are we condemning an organization that just donated over a hundred thous
    |nd dollars to charity, when people in wall street make millions and put and keep millions in debt every year? Find a real i

    |My friends and I used to hold a bingo and poker fundraiser for Komen every spring.  We have raised more than $20,000 in the

    |ded in this post.  //We decided that we couldn't support that organization any longer.  We formed a new charity (still in i

    |r medical bills and other cancer related expenses like wigs, etc.//We will hold our next fundraiser in March and we are hop
