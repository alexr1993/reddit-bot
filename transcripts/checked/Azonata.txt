                |il) and the NSA, which sort of pertains to the world at large; and the third is about a girl trying to end US d

                    |Fair point.//It's not exactly like the rules are kept to though.


            |Thats so stupid. First Scientology is not exclusive to the US and secondly the US is part of the world.


            |*"The globe"* does include the US. If you don't believe me, I advise you to call your old geography professor; he'l
            | explain.////*"US-internal news / US politics."*... Obviously things such as the US shutdown or the US presidential
            |campaign are meant by that. General news are not forbidden.


                |Wow, cool story, bro! Thanks for that super-brave explanation.////It's pretty clear that "general news" of this
                |sort *is* forbidden *because it was removed*. So, if you'll recall, was news about the bombing in Boston a whil
                | back.


                    |My theory is this: if Americans would care about the same news coming from Botswana, /r/worldnews cares abo
                    |t it coming from the US.////A bombing where 3 people die and a few are injured happens daily all over the w
                    |rld and isn't considered "front page news". 


            |That's retarded. Mod should lose his power over this. 


                |No, that isn't how reddit works. Moderators have near-total control over their subreddits, with the exception o
                | violations of reddit policy. The flip side of this is that if you don't like a subreddit, you're free to unsub
                |cribe from it, and, indeed, create your own alternative - see for example /r/games vs. /r/gaming, /r/ainbow vs.
                |/r/lgbt, /r/drama vs. /r/subredditdrama, /r/atheismrebooted vs. /r/atheism (LOL), /r/truereddit vs. the entire 
                |est of the website, and so on.////If you don't like the way /r/worldnews is run, you're certainly free to creat
                | /r/trueworldnews. In the meantime, **/r/news is exactly the subreddit that you want /r/worldnews to be.**

                |Yes.


        |Because it wasn't about Muslims


        |Going theory is things about the United States are deleted from that sub (news of the Boston bombing had been deleted a
        | well)


            |/r/worldnews hasn't allowed US news in years. it was created specifically because /r/news was too US centric. Not a

        |Well, that article presented the truth - I'm glad at least 5000 people saw it and I hope they tell their friends. But s

        |Because the circlejerk capacity in the comments likely reached critical mass and was about to detonate?

            |Yep. It's like a topic going viral instead of a video.

                |Or like a sort of wiki walk performed by the cloud instead of an individual.////A... wiki cloud walk.


                |Which is the #1 reason why I actually like reddit. The articles are often interesting, but what's more importan
                | is that people (at least I do) read into things deeper after seeing an interesting article. I've learned a *lo
                |* since being on reddit. Just gotta make sure you cross check some things against multiple sources.

        |Not that I'm aware off, except that the tiniest fraction of people on this planet became just that little bit more awar

            |Where you a former member ? That would make a good AMA


                |Hahaha heavens no. Just an anthropologist with your average anthropology interests out on fieldwork but with no
                |hing to do this Saturday. Although I agree that it would make on hell of an interesting AMA.


                    |hey, fellow anthropologist. I see that you have engaged in cultural judging, and I have now reported you to
                    |the AAA police. Hope you've got a handy lawyer, and Franz Boas quotes handy.


                        |Guilty as charged. But my bet is that Scientology will lobby the AAA into submission to keep their "cul
                        |urally deviant religious views" under wraps, letting me walk away scot-free. Won't you guys? ... Guys?


                    |As an anthropologist, why do (often very succesful) people join such a horrible organisation?


                        |Hmm that's hard to tell, the rich and famous are usually such an exclusive group when it comes to priva
                        |e matters, I don't think anybody outside their close relatives really knows what's going on with them. 
                        |///My best (and wild) guess is that they seek some sort of fulfilment in life that money and fame can't
                        |buy them. For some that might be sponsoring an AIDS event, or building schools in Africa, and for other
                        | that might be promoting a religion that (on the surface) pretends to do a lot of good for a lot of peo
                        |le. Maybe they don't get to see the ugly side, maybe they don't want to see it. Maybe they did see it b

                        |nk what's also important is that we separate the success of these people from the notion of them being 
                        |odlike intelligent people who could never ever make mistakes. They're humans like any one of us, and ju
                        |t like us they can make bad or downright stupid choices in life. No amount of money of fame can buy the
                        | the brain cells to make every right choice in life. The only reason we don't hear about half of them i
                        | because their money does actually allow them to buy the media and a good set of lawyers.

            |Eh... evil isn't going anywhere. In fact, increased awareness of evil makes  the world a worse place, because every
            |ne knows about it but nobody does anything. ~~Kinda like how the Kitty Genovese murder was worse than your average 
            |urder because of all the good folks who listened and watched.~~////EDIT: Better?


                |Fair enough, but people are absolutely definitely not going to act if they don't have the faintest clue about w

                |hings for the better. But your point stands, I don't count on any revolutions any time soon. 


                    |Nope. Probably no revolutions anytime soon. At least until they get knocked completely out of their fat lit
                    |le comfort zones. ////You are right, though, the more we know the better off we are, and the more likely we
                    |will do something about it. 


                        |I think in the case of Scientology it's up to governments to take action here. They are the once who pr
                        |vided the sect with loopholes to abuse for tax evasion and "religious freedom", while there are strong 
                        |rguments to disqualify Scientology as a religion. Once these securities are taken away it will become a
                        |lot easier to expose the sect for what it really is. I know that f.e. Belgium took a stance and disqual
                        |fied it as a religion, enabling extensive investigation into their (criminal) practises.


                            |The problem in this country is that every little sect will stick up for them, no matter what they d
                            |, to protect their own tax status. That makes for a lot of lobbying power. Not to speak of Scientol
                            |gy's own lobbying and extortion ability. It's a tough road. Especially since they feel no constrain
                            | about staying legal with what they do. Way too many attorneys are scientologists too. I'm not at a

        |His [book](http://www.amazon.com/Going-Clear-Scientology-Hollywood-Prison/dp/0307700666) is amazing and terrifying.


    |This shit is beyond fucked up, I have no clue why people would even bother following a religion like this. 


        |Read up on their beliefs. It would sound pretty convincing to you if you were rich and had some baggage. Your trauma wa

        |why do people follow any religion, Christians are just as fucked up, only they hide it behind what they call "kindness"

            |I'm assuming you are the Übermensch and know more about everything than anyone else. Nice to meet you.


            |You sound euphoric.  


                |So what you're saying is that it's okay to mock/criticize Scientology, but not Christianity?


                    |Saying the entirety of Christianity is the exact same as Scientology is ridiculous. Yes, there are plenty o
                    | things to criticize about all religions, but not only is Scientology on a completely different level than 
                    |odern Christianity; it is also completely irrelevant to the article being discussed. The people who bring i

                        |There are a lot of things that can be compared. Christianity uses money to influence politics much the

            |Main reason I'm a atheist XD


    |And *why* do people choose to join this cult, again? The idea of joining a "church" that can throw me in The Hole if I don'

                |I'm more afraid what will happen when non-member family and friends do decide to cut ties. No doubt it's an eno

                |you think you are, especially on deep topics like this.


        |[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULM0W_R1B-E), pretty much. Organizations like this are very adept at finding vuln
        |rable people and exploiting them. They prey on the weak and your vulnerabilities. It starts as "self help" or "self imp
        |ovement" or whatever. ////Once you get involved you have to be smart enough to recognize the manipulation *and* strong 
        |nough to resist it or you are likely to fall for it. If you don't have both of those traits there is a good chance they
        |will break you down. This is especially true if you are lonely, confused, weak, or desperate. Those who don't leave ear
        |y have the full weight of an organization put on them for the sole purpose of breaking them down and controlling them. 
        |///Whatever you are looking for or lacking be it friendship, power, success, control, they will offer to give it to you
        | They will tell you any lie they have to and use any guilt or manipulation they can. They are trained to find weakness 
        |nd exploit it. Salespeople, military recruiters, cult members, religion, political factions: it's all the same tactics.
        |Whatever it takes to close the deal.////Members are trained to always be recruiting and if you expose enough people you
        |are guaranteed that at least some of them will convert.  Sadly this has been going on for so long there is a science to
        |it and it's very effective. 


        |Stupid people


            |Easy for you to say, but under the right conditions you might fall for stuff like too. You just don't know.


        |They basically offer the same help a shrink can get you and just dont call it a shrink. Its not like the "selfhelp" or 
        |hatever they call it isnt helping.. its just that you could get the same from your local psychologist. People dislike g
        |tting actual psychological help, a lot of people feel like it would make them "weak" or "unable to solve their own issu
        |s". Scientology lets them believe they are healing themselves while brainwashing them on the side..


        |I went to a summer camp in Minnesota for several years in a row, a rich kid's summer camp, like millionaires' children 
        |o joke. ////I was recruited there. ////It was just another camper, nothing to do with the camp itself (Concordia Langua
        |e Village, btw), when he and I were alone he would  tell me all about this awesome organization his family was a part o
        |. I was from the East Coast, he was from the West Coast. He promised me that a few weeks after camp ended he would fly 
        |ut on his father's jet to DC and come get me and I could check it all out for a week or so and if I didn't want to retu
        |n to my family that was fine, I could stay with him.////I was 15. 


        |//The same way all religions or "cults" work. People are either born into it and its all they know.////Or they recruit 
        |eople by finding people who are lost / looking for help / depressed or generally weak minded. Before they realize what 
        |s going on they have been sucked in. It results in it becoming their social life and leaving it would cause them to be 
        |onely and lost again. After enough time it becomes "their life" and they start recruiting people as well as they consid
        |r it "normal" and everyone should do this.////


        |Same as Christianity - prey on the homeless, send missionaries to 3rd world countries, anyone desperate enough to follo
        | a religion in return for a little saving.////EDIT: I'm referring to mindgames. Not literally the same techniques. It's
        |all about power and finding subservient people to follow you.


            |Yes but when you get down to it Christianity as a religion is not looking for money. 


            |Interesting how some people fail to take a good look at who they would be "spending eternity" with.

        |Brainwash the brainwashers...


        |Because people not dedicated to the cause might bitch about it afterwards.


        |They're brainwashed enough by that point that they'll believe they need it or it's good for them, and won't ask to leav
        | or go to the cops. Remember, it's not false imprisonment if they don't want to go.


    |How can the execs be forced to go to a place like this?


        |It is voluntary more or less.  People that stay in $cientology are completely brainwashed and incapable of rational thi
        |king and therefore do not attempt to escape.  


            |Yikes.  Thank you for replying!


            |According to the wikipedia article plenty of people do try to escape, but Scientology has guards and "pursuit teams
            | in place to return them. From what I understand most of what we know of this place comes from people who managed t
            | escape.


                |It would be actionable then so why hasn't there been a raid on the compound?  I know they typically infiltrate 
                |he local government but this would get the feds involved.  If I had been held prisoner by anyone and the law wo
                |ld not do any thing about it I would be back locked and loaded.


    |How do they not get outlawed as a dangerous cult in so many 1 first worlds countries is something I do not get


        |Most of their followers are too afraid or too brainwashed to complain, and those very same first world countries tend t
        | attach a lot of value to the free practise of religious belief systems. There is a very fine line between outlawing pe
        |ple for their religious beliefs and allowing people to belief what they want to belief. It is understandable that few j
        |stice systems are willing to look for the edge of this fine line because of the moral implications that such undertakin
        | would have. 


    |Why would the executives be sent there? Wouldn't they be the ones with the power to stay out of these kinds of prisons? 


        |Executives is the wrong word I suppose. Yes, they are the once that execute the religious doctrine but they are still b
        |und by a strict hierarchy that makes them in turn nothing more but puppets of the higher leaders. They aren't like CEO'
        | with authority of their own. I think one of the reasons why the go to this place (besides being punished for screw-ups
        | is to promote competition between the different executives to make them commit ever more to the teachings of the sect.


    |So that's where Tom Cruise's closet is. Come out of the closet Tom. 


    |Didn't the wife of Scientology's wife go missing? Bet she's in there.


    |I used to drive by this place everyday on my way to work. It's very creepy. I never saw one person or car enter or leave th
    | gated compound. The walls are high and it looks like a small village from the outside.  I didn't know what it was until my
    |boss told me about it. The "hole"is not visible from the road. The place all together is pretty big. 


    |How the hell does this get to be defined as a church? Wtf. And tax exempt? Morally too I see.


    |Lol


    |now that sounds illegal


    |Said it before, and I'll say it again, FUCK Scientology.  Nothing good has ever come about from the entire organization. 


    |Good men do good things, and bad men do bad things.////But to make a good man do bad things, that takes religion.////They a
    |e not even the worst.


        |Very well said.


    |And still no one bats an eye because "it's freedom of religion"...


        |No one bats an eye? Who isn't batting an eye? My eyes are batting something fierce. I bet even religious people have th
        |ir eyes batting like baseball players. 


        |I think lots of people have batted their eyes actually... 


    |A prison within a prison


    |I wasn't going to click this, but I really needed to know if the guy in the thumbnail was sent there.


    |Kifflon my brothers. 


    |Yay, cults are fun!


    |Stupidity is enough punishment itself.


    |Serious question: Can someone explain to me like I'm five the point of Scientology, how it makes its money, and why celebs 
    |ollow it.


        |People get lost and Scientology appeals to them as an answer. Its normal, I don't blame people for ending up in a weird
        |cult when we have all been a little lost at one point in our lives.////People have a whole in there lives, nothing fill
        | it. Scientology does, or at least they feel it does.////They make money by charity, fund raising, several business own
        |d by the organization, stock/shares and donations. ////Celebs follow it for the same reasons everyone else does, they a
        |e lost sheep looking for a shepherd. ////


    |M.I. 5: Inside the Hole


    |Isn't that false imprisonment?


        |Well they really are being imprisoned. I think "wrongful imprisonment" fits better.


            |Same thing in meaning, really. "False imprisonment" is the legal term, literally imprisonment under false justifica
            |ion.


    |All I can picture is that prison that Bane was kept in all those years lmao


    |I don't understand this, why would an executive of their church be sent to their prison?


        |It's the word I suppose, they don't have executive authority of their own, they are just doing the bidding of those hig
        |er up, like cogs in a machine. I don't want to make the comparison with Christian priests because that introduces a lot
        |of wrong ideas.. but that's the closest resemblance I can think off. As to why they are sent to prison... I suppose it 
        |ould be anything from minor infractions, insufficient commitment or as a way to promote commitment through competition.


    |The Warden's name is Cruise... Tom Cruise.


    |So they're sent to work... I'm sent to work in a confined space all the time, It's called life!


    |Are they sure it wasn't COURTNEY LOVE from HOLE?


    |Just another case of a cult hiding under laws of a nation. I don't know, maybe it's because I am an atheist, but I can't fi
    |ure out how people get sucked into cults like this...


    |And they are forced to watch Battlefield Earth over and over and over...

    |Just remember, the people who "amend" Wikipedia are the same that post on reddit.


    |Well, they also have their own damned navy! It's where they go to commit crimes outside of country borders.
