    |People who regularly read the forecast discussions for their area. I read the one for my area every morning. And I wouldn't put it past
    |them to do something like this. They make subtle movie reference fairly regularly.

        |Dude, I have autism and just because most people who have it are really good at finding small details, doesn't mean you can general
        |ze the whole autistic population like that.////EDIT: What's with the downvotes? Okay, I know I was being a little butthurt in this 
        |omment. I get it.

        |Sure, but not only do you have to read this, but you also have to notice the subtle message hidden in it. That's the bit that's unu
        |ual.

    |Pilots are required by law to "familiarize themselves with all available information pertaining to that flight". The weather product pi
    |tured is part of a larger discussion involving "Area Forecasts" that discuss regional weather. It plays an important role in how a pilo
    | (in General Aviation and smaller Commercial operations, not airlines) may choose the route of their flight.////Some people are more in
    |tune to seeing details like that.

    |I'm guessing that someone at NWS spread the word but there's another big possibility:////In Alaska a lot of people read weather bulleti
    |s regularly.  In fact, parts of the forecasts are read multiple times daily on public radio.  It's very important for fishing vessels a
    |d other marine traffic to have up-to-date information.  It's totally conceivable that someone saw that on the printed copy.////

    |It's not that uncommon, people process information weirdly sometimes. For instance, when I look at a word that doesn't make sense (usua
    |ly a misspelling or a weird name) I automatically try reading it backwards to see if that will make it work. This stems from the mirror
    |of Erised in the 1st Harry Potter. One of my friends (or possibly my sister) worked out the code (everything is backwards) without havi
    |g to be told, whereas I missed it. Being young, self-conscious, and an obnoxious little brat, I took great offence to someone else work
    |ng out a code faster than me, and made sure to check every nonsense word I came across for backwards-ness in the future. By the time I 
    |ealised how ridiculous that was, it was instinct.////If there are other kids who react as poorly to semi-failure as I used to but came 
    |cross this sort of code instead, it wouldn't be that much of a stretch for them to automatically check for it in awkwardly phrased/form
    |tted text. Hell, it's still one of the first things I check for if someone posts a 'when you see it' type thing with text.
