|Pictures like this really cement for me the power of human accomplishment. You can't even see the land that Chicago sits on, only the man-m
|de towers rising above the horizon.

    |And the waves, frozen in the photo, almost looks like a tundra you can walk across.

        |Give it about six months.

        |That is likely the only record of the waves seen here in this picture. A short life that those waves lived, but these are among tho
        |e that will forever be saved.

    |The way the towers appear is actually an [optical illusion.](http://images.tutorvista.com/content/light-refraction/looming.jpeg) Look u
    | the definition of the word [looming.](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/looming?s=t) Also, [this diagram](http://ancientskyscrape

    |&gt;You can't even see the land that Chicago sits on////Yes, it's almost as if the earth were round!////

    |This shit is like right off a Star Wars movie.

    |ID: c5degil, Author: CaNANDian
    |And the pollution.

        |ID: c5df0rw, Author: KiloNiggaWatt
        |For people downvoting who don't know, that nice pretty red colour is due to all the atmospheric pollution from the city.

    |I think I also see a hipster on an old-timey bicycle.

    |Pro Tip: Dont refer to it as the Willis Tower. It is the Sears tower.

    |What are you doing while you're here?////Check out r/chicago or PM me for advice/recommendations. I'm especially good with restaurant r
    |commendations.

    |Get an Italian beef while you guys are there. If there's one thing I really miss about living in Chicago, its the food. Greek town has 
    |ome of the best Greek food this side of the Mediterranean as well. Also, deep dish is always fun for newcomers, but there's also some a
    |azing thin crust pizza as well.////I miss Chicago.

        |ID: c5dfcbp, Author: ggbrown
        |Thanks for the tips!! Eating in different cities is my specialty, my wife's is the shopping.////I'm all over deep dish. I was excit
        |d about NYC pizza, then discovered it was all thin crust, which isn't really my style.////
