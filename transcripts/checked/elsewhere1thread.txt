Thought gaming would appreciate this(/r/gaming.reddit: what's new in gaming)




    |Three buttons? Why?////It's cool but inaccurate.


        |The taggers name is Triplet.  It's supposed to be off.


            |Ohhh. Okay.


                |Remember if you do something wrong, but can convince others you're aware of it, you can get away with it 99% of
                |the time.////We don't talk about that other 1%....


                |Matt?


                    |Dylan?


                        |Murphy?


                            |really? Murphy? Who the fuck is named Murphy?! That's a dog's name. Are you saying I'm a damn dog? 
                            |errible guess and terrible person. I hate you. Seriously. Loathed. 


                        |Cole, you butt


            |oh? i dont see three middle buttons. i am dissappoint


                |It's because I made it up.  I have no idea what the name of the tagger is.  People will believe anything on the
                |internet.


                    |You sly bastard.


                        |When you think that "sly" is chat speak for silly, you may have been on the internet too long.


                    |Clever. I just saw the top reply to top comment and believed it.


                    |I was gonna say. Because the taggers name is actually Tré.


                        |[Tré Plétte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissemble), the famous French street artist.


                            |.......did he make it up or not?/////r/KarmaConspiracy


                            |Empty promises, empty promises [*everywhere*](http://?).


                                |Ugh that was like a really good Latvian joke


                    |You were quick enough that you got away with it.


                    |I just wrote a comment in reply to you, "how the hell do you know that?" but then saw this and deleted it. 
                    |Well played.


                    |These are the things that I don't know whether to upvote out of cleverness, or downvote because it's a horr
                    |ble lie.  I feel like this could somehow be analogous to the current political system, but I won't pretend 
                    |o understand that.


                        |Kill the phonies?


            |It's still blasphemy


            |Nice try, train graffiti impersonator, Mr. John Tripleti, alias Triplet. 


            |I say the same thing about my testicles, but no one is buying. 


            |How would you know unless it was you!


            |The writers name is triplet&gt;ftfy


        |Three buttons is not blasphemy.////That 3rd button is obviously the Turbo button on a 3rd party controller.


            |Fucking MadCats.


                |&gt;MadCatz////Not Xtreme enough.


                    |M@dC@tz


            |Turbo buttons aren't a seperate 3rd button. They're a seperate button on top of each normal button!


                |http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES_Max


                |I had one that looked exactly like this; It had A, B and TURBO which just toggled the turbo on or off for *ever
                |* button. The SEGA Genesis Turbo controllers had it's buttons like that.


        |Met dude before TEXER ALB... Three buttons for ALB, instagram: @your_cunting_daughter


        |My guess, when the train car's door is open it is only two buttons and thus becomes accurate


        |I knew this would be the top comment


        |because /r/mildlyinfuriating


        |I'm glad someone else noticed this////But then again this is /r/gaming, of course someone noticed


        |Its like a third nipple. I know its not supposed to be there, yet I'm strangely aroused. 


        |To plug on Genesis.////Or ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → C B A


        |That's how you can tell it's a cheap chinese knock off


            |Same with cheap Chinese hookers


        |"An extra button!? what do they (Reddit) have to see about that"////*checks comments*////ahh top comment, sweet sweet r
        |lief.


        |It's a Nintendrive pad.//    //    //Edit: Oh it was called Sega Genesis in the US no one will get this...


        |My question: why does it matter?


            |You tell that to C. J. Cregg.


            |My retort: why does anything matter?  


    |Do people just ride around with their phones on camera mode waiting for this opportunity to present itself? I must pass up 
    |ike 10 video game references a day and I never bother to take a picture of them.


        |I can't really speak for other smart phones, but the Galaxy S3 makes it extremely easy to access the camera. 4 buttons 
        |n the bottom of the lock screen (dial pad, google, internet, and camera). Swipe the camera icon and it goes from locked
        |screen straight to camera.


            |Apple phones/ipads/ipods do this as well. I think most recent touch devices have this feature.


                |Not if you bought a windows phone!  :(


                    |Windows phones have a button on the side that you press which wakes up the camera without any other steps..


                    |Back to your shanty!!


                    |Poor Trevor :C


            |I have an s3 that does not do this. How do I make this happen?


                |you have to use the default lock screen with no password.


                    |I'd rather not sacrifice my phone's security to be able to take pictures more easily.


            |I have the S3, the seconds it would take to go in my pocket, lift the phone and swipe and the second for the camera
            |to load would have the train long past me.


        |When some people see something interesting, the first thought is "oh man I should post this to reddit". It's not about 
        |arma or bragging rights or whatever, it's just an experience they want to share with others. ////


        |Think of all that sweet karma you pass up though.


        |HAHAHA BUT NINTENDO MAN!! /s


            |Hey, this guy is making fun of Nintendo! ***ANNIHILATE HIM!!!***////^^^^^Srsly ^^^^^guys ^^^^^get ^^^^^over ^^^^^yo
            |r ^^^^^fucking ^^^^^nostalgia ^^^^^Nintendo ^^^^^is ^^^^^a ^^^^^horrible ^^^^^company.


    |Is it bad it took me a moment to realize is real life and not a screenshot from GTAV


        |how can you be sure?


            |How do I know I'm not in GTA V right now? OH GOD


                |when you poop in GTA V you poop for real////


                |Go shoot someone and see what happens*//////////////////////////* DON'T SHOOT ANYONE


                    |Dont forget, if the cops come yell 'R1, R1, O, R2, UP, DOWN, UP, DOWN, UP, DOWN'. They should just leave yo
                    | alone afterward.


                        |I think you mean//Pull out a gun, put it back in your pocket, punch someone/air, punch someone/ air, ye
                        |l up, pull out phone, yell up, put back phone//I think that should make them go away


                            |Ahh, true. Forgot the new ones use a cell phone for cheats. Although this would also work, they'd t
                            |ink you're insane/retarded, either way, they'd leave you alone.


            |Exactly, this is a static image, it has no way to display the horrible texture/object pop in or the disappointingly
            |low framerate. 


        |The non-existence of a windshield definitely adds to the effect.


        |get your eyes checked. if you think the stretched lowres textures in gta v is similar to reality then something is wron
        |.


    |Is nobody else wondering how the hell he managed to take a picture of this moving train at the exact right time?


        |I've done a bit of railway photography. It isn't difficult, especially if you're aware of which piece of rolling stock 
        |ou wish to capture and it's general location on the train. You may have to chase the train a bit to get your shot, but 
        |hat's part of the fun of it.////This particular boxcar once belonged to the Southern Railway, which was merged into Nor
        |olk Southern (That name being a combination of Norfolk &amp; Western and Southern). The car now belongs to NS.////Inter
        |stingly, instead of the usual "paint a solid color block that the numbers can be painted over" method, the lettering wa
        | just painted over the art. This is why it took me a moment to realize it was graffiti.////Seriously, though vandalism 
        |s wrong. Also those letters and numbers the railway painted on the car are important. It shows who owns it, an individu
        |l identification number, and the car's specs so it isn't loaded improperly which can cause bad things like derailments.
        |///And yes, I'm one of those people who bought Train Simulator without it being a joke. :P


            |&gt; You may have to chase the train a bit to get your shot, but that's part of the fun of it.////What the hell do 
            |ou do for a living?


                |Video game music composer.


                |Train chaser by day, chicken chaser by night.


            |Maye the graffiti artist painted the numbers back over it, or painted around them with a detail brush. Or maybe it 
            |as black originally.


        |The train is probably going REALLY slow...


            |[Look at this train!!!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO31xshLEss)


                |...and then it stops and goes the other way for a while.


        |It could also be stopped or slow to change cars.  We can't really see enough to surmise the situation.////Then again th
        |s is reddit so the most obvious explanation is that they are full of shit and shopped a picture he found online of a re
        |ost!


        |Dashboard cam still?


        |&gt;moving train////That first part is a little presumptuous. You could spend *hours* staring at a train going by.

    |What fucking NES has three buttons?

    |oh, a control, painted on a train////how arsty

    |That's some high quality top to bottom.

    |This picture makes me angry.


    |Thank you.


    |Now I want to get a box car and custom paint a NES controller (with two buttons) on it for my model train.


    |Probably more comfortable than the original. 


    |A...B...C... woah, gaming just entered a whole new level!


    |The polls are in: they do. 


    |"Thought gaming would appreciate this"////That's usually how submissions work


    |You bought us a train?! Thanks! :D


    |Im 12 and what is this?


    |I appreciate this.


    |How did you have time to take a picture?


    |Three buttons?


    |That's some sneaky advertising there McDonald's.


    |is that a MadCatz controller? 


    |Up up down down up down a b c select start


        |&gt;up up down down left right left right b a c select start////FTFY


    |I'm appreciating it so hard right now.


    |There's nothing to appreciate about vandalism. It also looks like the little cretin who did this was too busy huffing their
    |paint to realize the NES controller only has two buttons. Overall, -3/10 - the same score I would give to Beyond: Two Souls
