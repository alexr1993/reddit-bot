I'm coming with you!(/r/The cutest things on the internet!)




    |Isis is a mix of Cornish Rex/Turkish Angora. Body is slender and short haired. 


        |She looks a lot like my Oriental Shorthair. Same sinew-y body type.


            |That was my thought. Coloring looks like a young flame point siamese too.


        |Thanks for describing the breed. I was thinking he was starved to this state otherwise.


    |I don't even have words to describe how cute this is.////Holy shit. 


    |Please tell me you named him Dobby


        |But I don't want him to die...


        |I would have named him Pinky.


        |//[It's a white JJ cat!](http://i.imgur.com/CNnwQjH.jpg)


        |I checked the comments to see if Dobby was in top comment. It was.//////Shut the fuck up, its getting very annoying. Ev
        |ry fucking /r/aww post with an animal with large ears is called Dobby. Dobby is fucking ugly and hideous, but this thin
        | is adorable. 


            |I think Dobby is adorable :/


            |Wow. You're serious about comments, aren't you? To each his own. 


    |Cute as heck, but seeing as there is a cat bed in there, it's a set up!


        |Aww no, you found me out !!!


    |He looks like a mouse!


        |I thought he was Pinky from Pinky and the Brain!


        |[deleted]


            |I said *looks*, not *is*!


    |Dem blue eyes.


    |How does it look like a cat and a mouse all at once?


        |[ It's magic (:] (http://imgur.com/npxon)


    |Looks like Mr. Bigglesworth's fur started to grow back


    |Awwwe he's looking for food! 


    |looks like pinky, from pinky and the brain


    |Anderson Cooper lost a lot of weight.


        |Anderson Coopurr 360


        |Don't make fun of Anderson Cooper and say he looks like a cat.////You'll turn him off pussies forever.


            |Hasn't he already done that?


                |whoosh!


    |Sure is a cute little feller.


    |Yes you are!!!


    |Pinky and The Brain?


    |Awh it looks like Mew.


    |I'm going with Joey here: That is not a cat!


    |Pink panther!!


        |Dat skull structure! 


    |why is it so skinny?


    |so skinny!!!!!


    |Little mouse cat. I hope he remains just as cute when he grows up.


    |This cat looks like a Pixar character (in the best way).


    |Feed that thing, Christ.


    |Please feed your cat.


        |He's part Cornish Rex according to OP, that's how they look. To be fair most people have cats that weigh more than they
        |should and we are use to chubby and fat cats as "normal". 


        |OP's cat seems to be an [oriental shorthair](http://i.imgur.com/jEo6Mdq.jpg), which are very svelte compared to "normal
        | cats.////It's probably fine and healthy.


            |I'm used to massive slab like barncats. We had this one named Ozzy who felt like a snake when you picked him up he 
            |as so muscular, so these things look weird to me.


        |Normal cats look like that, it's the fur that makes them all puffy. This one has very short fur.


    |That's not how I remember [it happening](http://www.empowernetwork.com/petewitt/files/2013/07/whos-coming-with-me-300x207.j
    |g).


    |Reminds me of Mac Manc McManx from Get Fuzzy.


    |Aww reminds me of my Red point Siamese kitten :3////Siamese are the cutest even if they get a bad rap


    |Damn, doesnt he remind you of pink panther? Just in white fur... :D


    |Cute cat, in a "chihuahua on crack" sort of way....how old?


    |fuckin anorexia pussy, plump taht pussay up. feed it an cheeseburger and watch the pussy get swole. dumb dumb... feed that 
    |ussy, bitch.


    |whats wrong with it...?

        |Homophobia "ain't cute" either. Take your shit elsewhere.

            |his is about faggots, not homosexuals. so quit being a faggot.


                |I am sure you are aware that faggot is a derogatory term for a gay man. 


                    |I am sure a faggot like you is aware that faggot is a derogatory word for a faggot. it has nothing to do wi
                    |h sexuality, but how big of a faggot you are. and anyway, faggot, that word has a shit ton of definitions a
                    |d only closed minded faggots like you try to make people accept the only definitions you approve of.


                        |The reason it is used as an insult is because of its association with gay man. Using the word faggot as
                        |an insult is homophobic. Incidentally, studies have shown that homophobia has a positive correlation wi
                        |h homosexual arousal, suggesting that people who are vehemently homophobic may actually be more likely 
                        |o be closet cases. This is supported by the trope of the anti-gay politician who is outed by a gay sex 
                        |candal. 


                            |you're such a retarded faggot, dude I'm not anti gay at all, I like to use faggot to describe faggo

                                |If you're not anti-gay, then stop using the word faggot. 


                                    |if you're not anti-gay stop thinking faggot only applies to gay people


                                        |It is a term of homophobic abuse. I'm not saying that it doesn't have other meanings, j
