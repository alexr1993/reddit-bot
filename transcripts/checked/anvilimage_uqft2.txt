    |A lot of government-sponsored projects happened around that time, if I'm not mistaken.  They were seen as investments in the country an
    | in the people, albeit long-term investments.  This, the Hoover Dam, and many others seem to have done quite well!

        |Infrastructure spending! It's one of the best things you can spend money on during a downturn. It creates temporary jobs, which low
        |rs unemployment, but doesn't create a permanent cost on the budget Additionally, the larger infrastructure creates greater producti
        |ity and prosperity once things recover.

        |This is why people confuse Keynes economics with socialist economics. I think people are fooled in how the government operates toda
        |. Government spending isn't bad, but there's a different in investment and simply transfer of payment. Government investment consis
        | of developing infrastructure (today roads and bandwidth), education, whatever to increase productivity for both business and the p
        |ople. Transfer payment is a form of socialism in which you take money from one group of people to give to another. There are charts
        |depicting GDP growth correlating to government investment. ////Unfortunately you have media pressure encouraging people to believe 
        |overnment spending is either wasteful or absolutely needed. Problem with society, they read headlines not information. The whole st
        |ucture of our federal budget needs to be restructured. That's what needs to be looked at, not as simple as just cutting or increasi
        |g spending to appease those who conform to "partisanship".

        |That and the fact that the president needed to create jobs for the unemployed and this was a cheap way to do it. In fact it was che
        |per to hire men to make this than it was to pay unemployment at the time. During the Great Depression the president had 8 million m
        |n employed for the entire duration of the Depression. The Works Project Administration. It was FDR I believe!

        |The Republicans fought the Bonneville Dam project viciously, calling it "Roosevelt's Folly."////In WWII, the Bonneville Dam hydroel

    |It was fully funded by Bank Of America, which started in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood. The government didn't think they cou

    |This could actually be seen as an example of [deficit spending](http://www.investorwords.com/1373/deficit_spending.html). An economist 
    |alled John Maynard Keynes *basically* argued the idea that when we are in recession, the government should increase spending (and there
    |ore increase the deficit of the economy). Because a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth (i.e. 
    |hen the aggregate demand within an economy falls for six months or more), government spending will increase aggregate demand and theref
    |re help with the recovery from a recession. ////**Edit:** Whilst this initial spending would worsen the deficit in the short run, it co
    |ld potentially lead to long term growth because of [the multiplier effect.](http://www.economicshelp.org/dictionary/a/accelerator-effec

    |Why would it be difficult for the government to hire people when demand is low?

        |ID: c4xprek, Author: ChickenShoes
        |Not at all. When demand is low, supply has to adjust to maintain an equilibrium between the two - people lose their jobs because fe
        |er people are required to meet demand.//When so many people are unemployed, people often try to get whatever work they can - this m
        |ans that people can be exploited to work for less (similar to the situation with labour in 3^rd world countries).

        |ID: c4xpue5, Author: gruntznclickz
        |Because you have people in the government that do not understand basic economics.
