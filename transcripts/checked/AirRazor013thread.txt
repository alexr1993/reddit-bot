                    |The car checks the airbag itself every time you start it.  It's wired up to the car's ECU (and I believe a 
                    |pecific airbag ECU too) so it's probably far more complicated than it's worth for your average airbag thief

                        |Your airbag light will be on if you have a bad airbag, seatbelt, anything. When you start your car, loo

                            |That's what I was getting at - the easy way to rig it would be to disconnect to light (or obscure i
                            | so it wouldn't detect a fault in the light?) rather than trying to fool the system check.  ////So

                |Yeah... that doesn't happen. If your car is new enough to have airbags then it most likely has on board diagnos
                |ics. If the airbags go off or were somehow not installed it would trip the airbag light and/or the check engine
                |light. Aside from that, the horn on your steering is part of the airbag assembly so if they don't install a new
                |airbag you'll just have a huge gap in the center of your steering wheel where your horn used to be.

            |No airbags do not contain gunpowder, gunpowder would not create enough gas to fill the bag.  The original airbag co
            |tained sodium azide, potassium nitrate, and silicon dioxide.  However this chemical reaction resulted in some toxic
            |products in the end so the industry no longer uses it.  There are many different things used in airbags now that do
            |not create toxic material, some even utilize an air canister with a pyrotechnic valve.  Pyrotechnic valves would be
            |the only thing containing anything remotely close to gunpowder.

                            |Pardon my ignorance, but does what you say also apply to the National Guard?

                                |It depends. It applies to them when they're acting under their Title 10 authorities (i.e., when
                                |they've been called up into active federal service by the President). It does not apply to them

                                |but they're under state command &amp; control) or when they're purely in state service. The key
                                |is the command and control, so the National Guard isn't going to be involved in border patrol o

                            |available for adoption. They were extremely negative and basically did not want to deal with anyone

            |Yeah fuck those bastards, giving homes to children without parents!


        |This! My wife and I are adopting ( in the process) a infant...20-40K


            |I really don't get this. Shouldn't people *get paid* to adopt children who need a home, and take care of them? This
            |seems totally backwards.


                |There is the foster car system which DOES pay you to foster/adopt children. The issue is that the kids are usua
                |ly 5+ years old already... NOT SAYING they do not deserve a great home but for our first child we wanted an inf
                |nt. So we are still actively looking into foster care but after sitting through classes and training sessions i
                |s not the path we want right now////In our area last year only 1 infant was adopted out to an outside agency ( 
                |ot the state adoption network). ////We did find a really awesome agency in Utah that offers a NO-RISK adoption 
                |nd it runs about 25K////The government ( when its running) offers a 13K tax credit for adopting. So really out 
                |oal is 13K and we are there. ////We had a nice chunk saved but our dog needed a 1,400 knee surgery. It is alway
                | something that comes up but one day ( hopefully soon) we will give a child a loving and caring home :)////

                |If that happened then you'd just have a bunch of shitty people adopting children for the short-term financial b
                |nefit and then neglecting &amp; abusing them. People *already* do that kind of thing.


                |You are essentially paying for the first few months of your child's life, including the several thousand in hos
                |ital fees the birth cost. Natural births are pretty expensive too.

                        |Paid for by the orphanage. They need to get money somehow.


            |This makes me so, so angry.  Tons of kids need stable homes, but the cost of adoption can break an otherwise-stable
            |home.


                |We keep an eye out for our states foster care system almost daily but you are right. The adoption costs are cra

                    |What is "birth mother matching"


                        |It's when they match potential adoptive parents up with a woman looking to give her child up for adopti
                        |n. 


                        |Really short version is finding a birth mother that matches your wants while taking the birth mothers w
                        |nts into consideration. ////Our wants would include - race( we are open to all raves) disability ( will
                        |we be open to a infant with some form or disability ) what type of adoption ( open/closed/partial)////T
                        |e girls wants would include - type of adoption and who ideally she would like her child to go to. /////
                        |Also at least in PA a child with special needs is very vague for adopting/fostering.It can mean a sever
                        | disability or something like the child has siblings that must be adopted together. So all they list is
                        |special needs without clarifying so people just overlook these kids In the foster care system. //


                |My parents adopted my sister (not related) and I from an orphanage in the early new Russia. They estimated it c
                |st them $90k direct cost and also the obvious 3 months not working back in NZ when they were basically stuck in
                |Russia during the political turmoil of 1993.


            |Do you take out a loan for something like that?  


                |Saving and fundraising. We earn enough to give a child a great life just not 40k laying around. Loans are also 
                |n the works. 


            |Can I ask if you're adopting domestically or internationally? Sorry I've always been drawn to adoption and my husba
            |d and I are starting to talk more about it since it can take like years of preparation. Everything I'm seeing says 
            |t's just getting harder and harder to adopt!


                |Domestically. We originally wanted international but the rules change frequently. And some have religious requi
                |ements ( morocco you must me Muslim////Once travel is figured in you are more or less right at the domestic cos
                | of adoption ////International is still a great way to go. Just not for us at this point


            |I always thought it was free.


                |I wish it was!


            |Is any of that 20-40k tax deductible?


                |13k is given back by the Feds 


        |As someone over 40 who looked into adoption, yes, yes I do.  I bought world series tickets instead.


            |Now that's a completely different ballgame.


        |Adopted girl here. I was always appalled actually at the amount of money my parents recieved from the state I was adopt
        |d from in order to get me tutoring and doctors visits. I've always wondered about the actually adoption agencies though
        | my parents don't talk about it. I do know however if you adopt siblings or children from the same families you can ben
        |fit financially. 


        |Costs like 10 or 20 grand, right? 


            |Here it costs around 20ishK AND you have to live in the boy's country for a month.


        |My boyfriends parents had four boys so they wanted some girls. Unfortunately for them they are scum of the earth white 
        |rash piles of crap and no American adoption agency would give them a child. So they put a second mortgage on their hous
        | and **bought** a pair from china. No joke.


            |Yup, here banks give you a special loan to buy a child.


        |Are you paying for the child, or for the take care of the remain of children? Kind of like a rescue shelter. It's a pyr
        |mid scheme, but a good one.


            |You're paying fees for official documentation, translators, orphanage costs and sometimes the director will shaft y
            |u. There's a great movie called Итальянец which highlights my case pretty starkly.


            |Don't really understand what you're asking, you go to the agencie and pay them to have the baby.


            |Most adoption agencies, especially in the states, don't hold the children. They get contacted by pregnant women loo
            |ing to place their babies, and most often the babies are places only days after birth with the adoptive parents. Ov
            |rseas where there are still orphanages, it's a bit different.

        |Lion urine? Hell, in most US states you can buy *lions*.//


        |You can buy deer piss to attract things.


        |Or you can cheese your brains out.


        |You can also use your own urine to keep deer out of your garden. My mother would have my little brother or my nephews p

        |It took me read someone's reply to realize it said "urine" not "urinal."//I imagined an awesome white porcelain lion sc

        |Tiger urine works pretty well in wolf traps, apparently.

            |As someone who went through a box of lucky charms separating out all the marshmallows and subsequently having a big
            |bowl of them for breakfast, you don't want the link. You think you want the link, but you don't. Its like eating re
            |lly dense cotton candy and actually tastes pointy after a while. Also, it may do some permanent damage, like causin
            | you to describe things as tasting pointy. 


                |Lost it at "causing you to describe things as tasting pointy."

                |The deliciousness of lucky charms resides in the balance between the crisp cereal and the marshmallows. Eating

            |So is it like prostitution for charity or more like "you now have one (1) virginity in your inventory"?


            |Hmmm need to look into that.


        |How would that not be prostitution? Not to say you're wrong, I heard that its happened on [Ebay](http://newsone.com/206
        |873/virginity-on-ebay/).  Still sex for money.


            |Prostitution is legal in Australia.


                |And New Zealand.////Land of the free.


                    |Don't forget Canada


            |Film it!


            |Nah man I payed for that lovely backrub, she just liked it so much she wanted to fuck me afterwards.


            |So what?


                |Don't get me wrong, I'm not against prostitution. I'm actually just looking for a loophole. Since you brought i
                | up how come filming porn isn't prostitution?.. Still sex for money.


                    |There is no payment from the man having sex to the woman having sex, or vice versa, in porn. That's why it'
                    | not prostitution. The person paying is the studio or producer of the video, they make all the payments to 
                    |he models, and they receive no sex in exchange for that money. All they receive is rights to film the sex, 
                    |nd paying to film someone is not illegal. ////So, to be clear, "let me pay you to have sex WITH ME while I 
                    |ecord it" is not the loophole. That's prostitution. "Let me pay you to have sex WITH SOMEONE ELSE while I r
                    |cord it" is legal... in a few parts of the country, at least, where these things get filmed.


                    |Why do you care if it's prostitution or not? It's just a word...


                    |It's not a loophole. It's prostitution, which happens to be legal in several places


                        |But, it's often filmed in states(California for example) in which it is explicitly illegal. 


                            |I was talking about the whole "selling your virginity online". Anyway, as far as porn in california
                            |is concerned... beats me.


                                |That's true, but at least in these United States prostitution is a federal crime. You would thi
                                |k the feds would be dicks about it like with cannabis.  Makes me wanna buy a good camera and th

            |Who said it wasn't prostitution? Of course it's (a form of) prostitution. But the .com.au should have told you that
            |it's also Australian. [Take a careful look at the map here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution#Legality) an

        |ickly. Basically you're paying a premium for lower quality.

                    |As a concrete worker, that's not something you want. 


                |Seriously, if you bend your finger at all the fabric slides and stretches on normal gloves. Only with these, it
                |would dig into your skin instead of sliding.


                    |Yeah, you'd think they'd have figured that one out in test trials.


                        |Uh huh. $750 gloves, sold as a novelty. Do you really think they went through extensive testing? 


                            |Well *someone* had to make sure the glove worked as intended.


                |Not if the glove material has the necessary give, either due to its own elasticity, or bunching of the material
                | 


                    |If that were the case, wouldn't you theoretically be able to take them off, as long as you went slowly enou

                        |I don't see how that follows *in general*, but if the gloves are capable of being rolled, it should be 
                        |ossible to roll them up.


                |You'd probably get poked a few times just trying to get them on.


                |I think that's the point. Like, the little barbs stick into your hand to stop them from sliding around


                |Actually, if the gloves are fitted they shouldn't do that at all. With 10,000  micro hooks essentially anchored
                |into your hand, that glove would need a real pull to let any give. ////The fitting, and what I suspect is the c
                |se, is somewhat relative to properties exhibited in tights (elasticity), but to a much...tighter...degree.////T
                |is would mean that the pressure from your gloves would seal it on.


                    |Try the following: ////* Put a few dots on your hands with a marker//* Put on rubber gloves, as tight or lo
                    |se as you want//* Put dots on the rubber glove directly on top of the marks on your skin////Then curl a fin
                    |er, and let me know if the dots still line up. 


                |Imagine getting in a fight. You try to clench your fist, spikes in your palm. You punch the guy, it shreds your
                |hand to pieces


                |Yeah, gloves aren't nearly as flexible as human skin.  Because of that, your hands would either be torn like yo
                | mentioned, or your hands would be incredibly stiff, depending on how well they fit.

                |My experience was longer than that.

            |The kind we tried kind of coated your mouth. They lasted longer if you didn't consume a lot of liquid, which was in

            |my great grandpa lived to 102 (or 103, i can't honestly remember) and he spent his last weeks literally begging his

            |rt but he had lived an incredibly healthy life so his heart was incredibly strong so, i believe, he ended up starvi

            |y beg for death, than give him a drug that would put him to sleep and let him go peacefully :(


                |Exactly, it's inhumane to not allow someone to control such an important aspect of their existence and let them

                    |Not to mention it is already common place to euthanize our pets when they get too old, sick or arthritic be

                    |Don't forget the issue of who's choice it is. Don't get me wrong, I'm absolutely for euthanasia, but we hav

                    | may be easily pressured into suicide so that her children can benefit from her will. How do we make sure a

                    |g that decision?


                        |Very carefully is the answer. We'd need plenty of safeguards. 


                    |This is an unrelated knowledge is power kinda thing, but some research suggests that the potassium cyanide

                        |Aren't they put to sleep with different chemicals before that?


                            |Yeah, but the theory, if I remember correctly,  is whatever they use first doesn't play well with t
                            |e cyanide. For that reason, it more just paralyzes them with their eyes closed as they suffocate.


                                |I really doubt it. It's too easy to falsify. Just use the non-lethal drugs on somebody and ask 
                                |hem about it when it wears off. And if the drugs affect the memory, then hook them up to an EEG
                                |machine and watch their brainwaves for response to stimuli. 


                                    |Well, if the problem is *specifically* the way the anesthetic reacts with the lethal agent,
                                    |then this wouldn't necessarily falsify that theory, as the idea would be that the potassium
                                    |cyanide interferes with the action of the anesthetic, causing it to only have the partial e
                                    |fect of paralysis without suppressing consciousness, at which point either pain or suffocat
                                    |on wakes the person up just in time to be conscious, but paralyzed, for the whole ordeal.//


                                        |That's a real stretch. And again it would probably show up on an EEG.


                                            |*What* would show up on an EEG?////The theory is that the anesthetic fails to work 
                                            |s intended *when injected concurrently with potassium cyanide*.////Thus, any experi

                        |I don't believe it specifically says anything about suicide or euthanasia but it does speak about the f
                        |ct that God is the sole giver and taker of life, not man.  Any form of killing is looked down upon alth
                        |ugh the Old Testament makes some allowances for Jews to kill their enemies.  My guess is that if we wer
                        | not a religion dominated society then suicide and euthanasia would not be a big deal.


                |Human rights are all about protecting people and their dignity. If someone is going to die, let them die with d
                |gnity on their own terms. Euthanasia is one of few things I would fight for, especially after reading about you
                | great grandfather. May he rest in peace. 


                    |he was truly a wonderful man with so many stories. i wish i could've spent more time with him, but the summ
                    |r and winter visits we made to visit him and my great grandma are wonderful memories. ////and i told my dad
                    |that if i was ever in my grandma's position, i'll make sure he's totally doped up on morphine 24/7 so he ne
                    |er suffers. i don't know how my grandma did it. it would kill me to hear my father in that much pain and no
                    | be able to do anything :(


                |Was he in hospice care?  Not to reopen a wound but modern hospice care should have provided him with painkiller
                | that would at the very least reduce his amount of total suffering.


                    |he was at home with my grandma in georgia. i believe he was on painkillers but not enough. this happened a 
                    |ew years ago so i'm not sure of all the details


                |We don't allow animals to suffer but we sure as hell will let a person suffer. 


                    |exactly. we put our first dog down because of cancer and our second because of a degenerative spinal diseas
                    |. as a family, we couldn't watch them suffer any more. but humans? well that's just too bad


                |Having just gone through this with my Grandfather, I could not agree with you more.


                    |i'm so sorry about your grandfather. it just seems so cruel! everyone talks about "pro-life" but what about
                    |people who are going to die? why can't we help them go out with dignity and peace?


                |If you are in the US, hospice care is available. I only know about the US. Meaning, when there is nothing else 
                | doctor can do and one is suffering, their care changes from healing to comfort. My grandma passed last year an
                | had the same problems with choking on anything. Hospice came in and kept her as comfortable as possible until 
                |he passed. I know a lot of people on hospice care (and a few who have been but made it through). Essentially, t
                |e drugs are supposed to just comfort, but eventually they cause someone to relax so much that they usually just
                |fall asleep and "forget" to breath (because they're so relaxed)


                |Starvation? What exactly was his condition, if I may ask? Like, if he ate what would have happened?


                    |all i know is that when he tried to eat, it would somehow go to his lungs. i'm not sure why he wasn't on a 
                    |eeding tube (maybe he was for a while, like i told someone else this happened a few years ago in georgia an
                    | i'm in NE so i wasn't able to be there)


                |Religious people dont like it. The good news is google will tell you plenty of ways you can peacefully and effe
                |tively kill yourself so its not that big of a barrier unless you're bed-ridden


                |At that point the docs should keep him so medicated he doesn't know what day it is. 


                    |That's actually what their supposed to do, if that is what the patient (or person legally in charge of thei
                    | medical choices) agrees to. It's called hospice care, and it's different for each patient, but the point i
                    | usually just to give the patient a comfortable passage from the world. At least, that's been my experience
                    |with hospice in ohio


                        |Yeah, I know. 


                            |Sorry :( I meant that to further explain your point to the poster of the comment you responded to.

                                |thread, which sometimes I forget to do. 


            |it's a bit weird to state you can buy euthanasia because you get it for free, socialist country woooh.


            |Personally, I think it fits the question in that you can essentially purchase death. *That* is weird. Wanting to di
            | peacefully on your own terms? Not weird. I think it's mostly the concept that we have the ability to put a price t
            |g on it that makes it so weird to think about, not the euthanasia itself. 


            |Euthanasia isn't weird, but having to buy it kinda is I guess.


            |Neither should kidney donation. You have an extra.


            |the weird part is that it's totally fine to use it on animals.


            |I'd say it is a little weird. Not at all a bad or unacceptable thing, but voluntarily putting an end to everything 
            |hat is you is a little weird. 


            |I was just hearing some news about air pollution and someone was outraged that every year, thousands of people "die
            |too early". How come we can't be as outraged that we force people to die too late?


            |I find it so odd that we see euthanasia as humane when it comes to our pets (aka "i didn't want fido to suffer") bu
            | inhumane when it comes to humans, who are actually capable of making that decision on their own unlike our animals


            |You are correct. I am a doctor and I fully believe euthanasia should be legal, especially for people in control of 
            |heir own mental faculties. However, like all technologies which involve life and death, it opens up avenues for abu
            |e. ////Example 1. Suppose I am very old and fed up with living. I request euthanasia. However, I also have very lov
            |ng family members who block my request to the doctor, saying I am obviously delusional due to my age and cannot mak
            | my own decisions. I die a painful and slow death due to starvation (like as described by a Redditor below).////Exa
            |ple 2. Suppose I have a disabled son who cannot communicate in any way. I am fed up with taking care of him, so I g
            | to the authorities responsible for euthanasia (who should hold such power is another issue completely), and reques
            | euthanasia because I "no longer want him to suffer". Now who is to say I am telling the truth or lying? ////Exampl
            | 3. Suppose a few siblings are fighting for inheritance of a very rich relative who is on his/her deathbed. One arg
            |es for euthanasia since that is the "humane" thing, while others argue against it. Who should be in the position to
            |decide?  ////Morality, humanity, ethics... It is a complicated thing.


                |God, working in a hospital, its horrible how people suffer because their families will not let them go. If only
                |more people could see what its like. ////But as you said, it is so complicated, and such a hard thing to be hav
                | to choose when its eight and when its wrong.


            |What they're afraid of is people being guilted/"forced" into it - save the family some money/etc.


            |Things can be perceived as weird without being vilified. I think euthanasia is inherently weird just considering ou
            | basic instincts that drive us to survive. That's a generalization though, because given enough pain and suffering 
            |'d definitely opt for the cyanide or whatever, but I'm kind of a coward. I also think condoms are "weird" for simil
            |r reasons.


        |Euthanasia is not really bought, it's requested and only allowed under several circumstances.

                        |forgiven in events called Jubilees.////They were able to raise over $1 million, and were able to forgiv
                        | $20 million worth of healthcare debt.  AFAIK, the debt was picked at random.


                            |So no hope for my student loans. Its not that I can't eventually pay them back, its just that I don
                            |t want to carry them at 6% if I know I will have to pay them back no matter what.


                                |I know some of the organizers. They chose to forgive healthcare debt mainly because it's less c
                                |ntroversial, and harder on people's lives. Generally, people aren't prepared for a sudden onset
                                |of huge hospital bills, whereas students with four years of debt have more time to prepare.////

                    |I don't know that much about this but i think the buy in bulk strategy is at play here. Plus it depends on 
                    |ow risky your debt is valued at by the bank. They don't sell low risk debt because their isn't really much 
                    |hance of default.


                        |They will only sell a debt if it IS in default, typically.  That means over 150 days late.  Now, servic

                    |I think a branch of OWS did this, forming a debt collection agency that would buy and subsequentially drop

                    |The trouble is that most of the debt that companies want to sell is bad debt, unlikely to be repaid.  When 
                    |ou buy it, you're gambling that you can collect more money in payments from the debtors than the amount tha
                    | you paid for the debt AND your expenses incurred while attempting to collect the debt.  


                        |You can still get paid. (at least in the uk) With a court order you can get baliffs in who can legally

                            |Yeah, it works like that here too, but getting the court order is expensive and the odds are good t

                    |se, and were successful?////Technically, yes. 9p on the pound was the best deal I saw a collector do, when 
                    |loyds TSB had fucked up royally with mis-selling PPI, they needed money to pay the fine and sold a shit-ton
                    |of bad debt at piss-all prices just to get the millions on hand to pay. I can still remember seeing my clie
                    |ts' letters from the new collector saying "if you can pay 15% of the balance, we'll accept that as full and
                    |final settlement".////Think about it: To the collector, that's nearly a 100% gross return on the purchase p
                    |ice of the debt, and to the debtor, that's a fantastic opportunity to clear their debt at an amazingly low 
                    |mount.////Ninja edit: I should probably point out that defaults on your credit file will normally bar you f
                    |om being granted a license, so it's doubtful you would buy your own debt. But you could buy *someone's* deb

                    |Simply stated, yes. 


                    |I actually really like the idea of starting a debt-buying company that specifically purchases the debts of 
                    |ts clients to eliminate them at near-cost, meaning you could pay off $10000 of debt for like $1000... Then 
                    |eports the debt as paid to credit agencies to help clean up people's credit.


                    |If your sneaky and use a corporation to do it, you probably can buy your own debt for pennies on the doller


                    |It would be hard, but yes. What's important though is that you can *settle* your debt for 25-50 cents on th
                    | dollar. Probably not with the original creditor, but definitely with a collector. Keep in mind, they are a
                    |ready making a profit, it's just a matter of how much.          //It's all a matter of your income and risk
                    |for the collector in the event that they sue you. For instance, if you haven't paid on this debt in 5 years
                    |and barely make any money or have a bunch of other debts, then they'll be very happy to take $200 dollars f
                    |r a $1000 dollar debt, since it's not likely that they'll get much if they sue you. However if you make a l
                    |t of money or have some property and they find out about it, then they won't settle, or highball you since 
                    |hey know they can get more our of you. It becomes a matter of negotiation.          //The trick is to be fi

                    |g first, or I'll just use that money to pay someone else. No?" *hang up*. Eventually they'll cave in(in fac
                    |, I think there's a formula for when they can do that, but don't quote me on that). Two important notes:   
                    |   //1) Always get the agreement to settle in writing first. Email is fine.       //2) Never give them acce
                    |s to any of your accounts. Send a money order or cashier's check, never a regular bank check. They will cle
                    |n you out if they can. ////Also, one last factoid: you can't bankrupt your student loans, so no bank or col
                    |ector will settle on them. AND federal government can come after you if you don't pay on them. So definitel
                    | pay those loans on time.


                    |That's exactly how it works


                    |Those are called 'Collections Agencies', and you can do that, but you need to have no soul first.


                |So why doesn't the original lender just accept the 50/75% lump sum from the debtor. Wouldn't they come out ahea
                |?


                    |They could and would. This is why most of the time the debt is only sold if the debtor refuses (or can't) p
                    |y.////Now there are 2 options:////a) Spend time and money trying to get the debtor to pay, with a significa
                    |t chance that both is wasted, as the debtor simply might have no money.////b) Sell the debt for a *guarante

                        |Wait, if I magically had about 60% of my student loan balance available to pay in one go, I could call 
                        |p the issuer and possibly pay it off in one lump?////What kind of likelihood are we talking here? I hav

                            |Of course you can negotiate, call your bank and tell them you have X ammount and want to pay it off

            |Let's say you go into debt with your bank. The bank can sell your debt to a collection agency - they do this if the

            |t, and it was her, so terrified she could barely talk. She had stolen a cell phone to call me from the basement of 
            |he "boarding school house" she had been sent to.////Without going in to too much detail, her parents were a doctor

        |Why?


            |Because it's easier than properly raising your kids yourself. Especially in this day and age, where not a whole lot
            |is expected from parents.


                |So you send your kids to live with a complete stranger half of their life which is supposed to be used forming 
                | bond but than when their 18 they break the bond and ship them to their parents (Who will be strangers to them)
                | I don't see the point, if your not set on raising your children, than don't have any.


                    |But you can't "not have kids" when sex is awesome, abortion is murder, and contraceptives are against your

                        |True. 


                    |Yes, parents in recent times are that dumb. Pretty much every issue in society from people can be traced di

                    |This is the wisest comment in the thread, you summed it up perfectly. 


                |Also many kids are sent wjen their parents discover they are gay and send them off to places that specialize in

                |I think trying to get in the head of a parent that feels the need to send their kid to one of these places is p

    |Insurance companies buy insurance for their insurance.  It's called reinsurance.////Broader explanation: Insurance companie
    | expect to make a profit based on their actuarial models (otherwise they wouldn't issue the insurance), but sometimes they 
    |ish to reduce risk/volatility, so they pay a small premium to have other insurance companies insure their insurance policie
    |.  This safeguards against (unlikely) high-loss events.  There are other reasons to buy reinsurance, but this is the main o
    |e.////Many insurance companies engage in reinsurance, and there is a web of companies insuring each others' insurance.////[
    |dit]//Okay I get it, 'yo dawg', 'insuranception', etc.


        |sounds like hedging 


            |Essentially it is.  It covers the situation where you get too many claims against a group of policies covered by a 
            |einsurance contract.  It also has other uses such as allowing you to underwrite larger risks than you have licensed
            |capacity for^1////Reinsurance is particularly useful in commercial business where you may be covering large individ
            |al risks, although it's used throughout the insurance industry.  A large commercial carrier may have several hundre
            | active reinsurance contracts - it can get very complex.////Another common type is called 'catastrophe' reinsurance
            | which typically covers specific types of large events such as hurricanes.  Large contracts of this type may split 
            |our risk over dozens of individual carriers.////^1 Insurance carriers are typically licensed for their total capaci
            |y (amount of premium they are allowed to write in a single year) and the maximum size of an individual risk they ar
            | allowed to be exposed to.  If you want to underwrite something larger than you are licensed to carry then you can 
            |ind various means (including [facultative](http://www.irmi.com/online/insurance-glossary/terms/f/facultative-reinsu
            |ance.aspx) reinsurance) to spread the load.


                |Yea, sounds like reasonable prep for a hurricane, meteor impact, nuke, etc.


            |I think this would be the most likely use case for reinsurance, but I'm not in the industry so I don't know for sur
            |.


        |As someone who works in reinsurance, I'm not exactly sure why this is weird? How do you expect insurance companies to h
        |dge their risk, if not to sell part of it on? 


            |How do reinsurance companies hedge *their* risk? And why should any company expect to be able to do business risk-f
            |ee?


                |Reinsurance companies do a few things. There are forms of insurance that reinsurance companies take out (retro 
                |nsurance) for one. For another it's largely capital allocation and diversification.////A reinsurance company wi
                |l have risks all over the world, covering many types of risks, insuring against many types of losses. It's the 
                |ame basic principle that any hedge-fund manager uses, but with insurance contracts as opposed to shares.////Say
                |there's an earthquake in Japan. Well OK, a reinsurance company will lose money on every Japanese contract they 
                |ave that covers that. They, however, might not lose money on US contracts that year, or on any contracts that o
                |ly cover Typhoons. It's also possibly they've bought insurance that caps their loss on specific high-valued con
                |racts to a certain amount. Their retro insurance will give them some kickback. Then there's the fact that the d
                |rect insurers will all have retentions that they pay, and the end-consumer has their own retention. So there's 
                | big earthquake in Japan but the reinsurer only pays a portion of that loss out, and it's not their only market
                |they're operating in. ////(And, to the benefit of everybody, the direct insurer in that region will have to pay
                |out only the bit of money after the consumer retention, but before the reinsurer is liable. The idea being that
                |they won't go out of business either, even though their business is largely limited by where they're based.) 


                |&gt; And why should any company expect to be able to do business risk-free?////Because they're paying someone e
                |se to assume that risk.


                    |You didn't get it. He implied that any business could or should aspire to be risk free. Those business do n

                        | do that, a globalised market of reinsurance just makes that way easier. 


            |It makes insurance look like a monopoly of sorts.


                |... How? What, no it doesn't? The fact insurance companies can sell on parts of their risk actually increases c
                |mpetition. It means that almost every single company in the world can bid for almost every insurance contract i
                | the world.////That means that there's less likely to be monopolies in small local regions/specific countries/w
                |atever. And because insurance contracts renew after a set time (usually a year) it means those prices are const
                |ntly reassessed, being re-bidded, and so the competition has to actually stay competitive forever. There aren't
                |things (like for example 50 year bonds) which keep going practically forever. Everything's value is constantly 
                |eing reassessed. ////I think maybe what you're think of is a cartel? But there are so many insurance companies,
                |and they're all competing against each other for business, that a cartel would be near impossible to pull off. 


                    |Doesn't reinsurance tie the success of each insurance company into the success of every other insurance com
                    |any? How is this reducing competition? Maybe there are too many companies involved for this to actually mat
                    |er though. Please correct me if I'm wrong about this.


                        |No, every time an insurance contract is sold, the broker (the intermediary between the direct and reins
                        |rance companies) will go to every reinsurance company he can and will get a price from each one. ////Th
                        |n, every reinsurance company will go to every other company to buy their own insurance (this is retro i
                        |surance.) which again is bidded on by a bunch of different companies.////Every contract is renewed ever
                        | single year, meaning that prices are being bidded for every single year by every single company out th
                        |re.////It also means that a small insurance company can easily take very small portions of very big ris
                        |s, and so can put in bids for contracts they can't cover the entirety of. Meaning the barrier to entry 
                        |o the industry is actually quite small. (Unlike with banking, where some products can only be fulfilled
                        |by the already very big institutions.)////... I hope that explains it? Basically the idea being, there 
                        |re so many companies out there that if they did try to form a cartel, it wouldn't be able to win any of
                        |the contracts as the companies that don't join the cartel would just underbid them.////The insurance co
                        |panies are all competing for the contracts that they think they can make money on. They use each other 
                        |hen they sustain a loss, but if they don't; they want to be the ones that are getting a portion of the 
                        |remiums. They're all fighting for the cash inflow, which is the best situation you want a market to be 
                        |n. ////If you didn't have reinsurance companies, the people who would be taking up the contracts would 
                        |e entirely made up of the two or three companies that can sell insurance products in their specific mar
                        |et. This way; every company in the world can take on the risk of every region. It lowers the cost of ta

                            |opoly at all. I guess that's because each business has to do business directly with its competitors
                            | which seems a bit counter-intuitive on the surface. I see why it's a good thing though.


                                |Maybe it'll help if you remember that every bit of business that happens between two insurance 
                                |ompanies will be done through a broker, an indimeditary that's trying to get the best possible 
                                |rice in order to up their commission. So companies don't *really* do business directly with eac

        |Yo dawg. I heard you like insuring things, so I sold you insurance for your insurance so you can insure your insurance 
        |hile you insure your assets.


            |Your assurance you'll ensure I can keep insuring is reassuring.


        |This isn't really weird. Maybe unknown to some but it doesn't mean weird. 


            |Exactly. I'm studying insurance (and am taking a course in reinsurance, for that matter). This isn't weird at all. 
            |ome insurance companies aren't sitting on piles of money. How do you think they're going to cover a ridiculously hi
            |h loss?////They get someone else to do it and pay them while still being able to manage business.


            |I think it's pretty weird.


            |It's god damn stupid, that's what it is. We'd save so much money if, instead of insurance, the government covered t
            |is. In years with little payout needed there'd be extra funds going towards infrastructure and the like. If somethi
            |g major happens, like a hurrican, *everyone* will get help. The only thing private insurance leads to is a lot of p
            |ople on pay rolls, everything from the bureaucracy running the enormous corporation to the people paid to do market
            |research and make commercials / ads, etc.


                |you might want to take a look at the federal flood insurance program, which is just full of win


        |Is it weird that that doesn't seem weird? 


        |So who insures the insurer's insurance? Can they recursively insure each other, creating a an infinite loop? 


            |Yeah, but come payment time, someone has to pay up. Instead of a loop shape, it's more of a lasso- the company that
            |is originally paying for the loss has to be paid to begin with.

                        |You have got to be kidding me... 


        |That's interesting.////I wonder if it could collapse? Maybe if a VERY large chunk of the insurance companies' customer 
        |ll died at once (assuming they have life insurance).////Or could this turn into a bubble, like with the housing crash? 
        |hat if insurance companies started manipulating this system to increase profits?


            |It actually lowers the likelihood that insurance companies will go bankrupt. Everybody can buy a small amount of lo
            |s of different risks.////This means two things.////Firstly: that if someone suffers a loss, that loss is spread out
            |across many different companies.////Secondly: that every company can diversify their risks, meaning if they lose in
            |one [location/market/whatever] it will only affect a small amount of their overall business (say you insure homes i
            | both the US, and Japan. One event can't result in payouts on both sets of houses.)////Soooo... The losses are spre
            |d out across many companies, all of which can sustain those losses. 


                |Except for the part where re-insurance companies take on more risk than they can realistically handle, especial
                |y if prices of stocks &amp; bonds also go down in value around the time one of the bad events occurs as all ins
                |rers and re-insurers don't just sit around with giant stacks of cash, they invest the vast majority of their re
                |erve assets.  ////One of the major components of the financial crisis was caused by a similar setup with credit
                |default swaps on mortgage backed securities.  Banks issued home loans to unqualified buyers and at prices that 
                |re obscenely high.  They combine hundreds or thousands of these loans into a single asset (mortgage backed secu
                |ities).  They then bought insurance to compensate them if these homeowners can't repay their debts (credit defa
                |lt swaps).  The people who insured the banks started going bankrupt when homeowners defaulted at a higher than 
                |xpected rate.  The stock market came crashing down as did home values and most other asset classes.  All those 
                |omes that the banks reclaimed to try and cover their losses on the loans that aren't getting paid back are only
                |worth a fraction of what's owed on them.  Banks had a relatively small perecentage of their assets in cash, the
                |r investments are tanking in value, and their real estate is worth a fraction of what they owe.  This essential
                |y meant they had no where near enough money to pay back the people who had deposited money into them, thus dras
                |ic measures had to be taken by the government.////Back to re-insurers, this system is setup for failure too, al
                | it takes is a big enough event.  Let's say some new strain of bird flu comes around and is particularly contag
                |ous and lethal.  People stay home from work to ride it out, the stock market starts crashing because of the dra
                |tically decreased economic activity, hospitals are overflowing and both health &amp; life insurance companies a
                |e in really rough spots.  But that's okay, they all bought re-insurance!  Except the reinsurance companies aren
                |t nearly well funded enough to pay out their liabilities for a problem of this scale.  Neither are the insurers
                |  Come to think of it, that sort of catastrophe is probably what it will take for the U.S. to finally embrace u
                |iversal healthcare.


                    |catastrophe bonds were invented for this reason.  the assets invested in the capital markets are much much 
                    |arger than the assets of the entire insurance industry, and when the largest reinsurers realize they need m
                    |re protection, they use cat bonds.


                    |OK you've just thrown a lotta' stuff at me and none of it is hugely relivent. ////First, there are strong r
                    |gulations on the amount of (liquid) capital a reinsurance company has to keep (unlike with banks pre-2010.)
                    |So that's not likely to happen. ////Secondly, the majority of reinsurance companies DON'T keep their capita
                    | reserves in investment. Investment at most firms is less than 5% of their business, and is usually only do
                    |e to pay for their fixed costs (like to cover their rent,) not for profit. And the majority of insurance co
                    |panies will be investing in currency markets, because that can also lower the operating cost of their busin
                    |ss (say for example they suddenly need to pay out in a currency that isn't their primary one, sometimes it'
                    |l be cheaper to lose out on their potential investment return than to exchange again now.) ////And finally 
                    |ecause of the types of insurance that make up the majority of the market, your hypothetical is just basical
                    |y impossible. The majority of the reinsurance market (like almost all of it) is property insurance. Health 
                    |nd life insurance make up a very very small amount of the market, the coverage there alone wouldn't be enou
                    |h to bankrupt any reinsurer.////And then again, you're forgetting a key component of insurance markets: the
                    | renew. ////Every single insurance contract will renew at some point, and again most of them do it on a yea
                    |ly basis. There are contracts renewing throughout the year, and so if there was any giant unforeseeable eve
                    |t, it wouldn't destroy everything. At the worst case it would lower the profits for that one year, then the
                    |next year the company could reassess their pricing policies to ensure they don't fall apart. This is comple
                    |ely different from the housing market, where Mortgages last anywhere from 20-40 years. Or the stocks and sh
                    |res market, where businesses may take 3-7 years to become profitable.////And then there's the fact that mos
                    | premiums are fixed, it's not like an asset based market where suddenly you can lose the entire value. The 
                    |nd consumer will always have to pay their premiums, and cover their deductibles; the direct insurer will ha
                    |e their retention; the reinsurer will then have paid for retro insurance (a bunch of different types of ins
                    |rance for reinsurance companies) which will activate, they will have their capital reserves, any investment
                    |returns, cash held from last year, and they will only actually be liable for a small amount of the losses. 
                    |n that situation you are taking on a big risk, but are only liable for a small amount of the losses. That i


                    |the danger is smaller for insurance companies since they are the ones paying out AFTER getting the payments
                    | Banks give a lump sum BEFORE the payments.


            |Could I take a life insurance policy out on people likely to join the military? this sounds like a terribly immoral
            |business plan but I'm curious


                |Life insurance is strictly regulated such that you must have a "life interest" to take a policy out on another 
                |erson. For the most part, family/spouse/guardianship only////edit: though back in the day you could basically g

            |d with AIG and credit default swaps. The problem with those were that CDS's, which amounted to insurance contracts,

        |Do reinsurance companies ever reinsure their reinsurance policies?


            |Yep. Reinsurance doesn't have to stop with the reinsurer. They can get another reinsurance company to take on some 
            |f their obligation in a case.////You could potentially have hundreds of reinsurers paying for a single loss, at lit

        |Can you insure an insurance policy on an insurance policy?


            |Yes, you can.  There are a category of reinsurance contracts called ['Original Loss Warranties'](http://en.wikipedi
            |.org/wiki/Industry_Loss_Warranty) that cover reinstatement payments on [X/L contracts.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wik
            |/Reinsurance#Non-proportional).////In this case you are insuring yourself against having to pay out a large reinsta
            |ement payment (payment to reactivate a contract covering a finite number of events) on an X/L contract.////I've see
            | these things 4 layers deep, and seen the resulting transaction fest that arises if you commute the aforementioned

            |You can also get special endorsements on your policy, most common one is for equipment breakdown. Most commercial p

            |a power sure and not lightning (usually covered) your carrier can submit the claim to the endorsing company, IE Har
            |ford Steam Boiler (one of the biggest companies in the industry.)////Source: I work for a company that provides con

        |urance plan, which every single resident has.


            |Normally it's used across a whole portfolio of risks (treaty reinsurance), or on individual risks where there is a 
            |ikelihood of a large claim liability.  It's most interesting on commercial risks where you are covering larger item
            | that could be subject to expensive losses.////You do see it on retail insurers - life/pension products with large 
            |aturity values may be hedged with reinsurers to mange the risk of large individual payments.  Catastrophe cover to 
            |educe the impact of a disaster (e.g. flood) related claim for a large number of insured risks in a single event.  P
            |etty much every insurer will have some sort of high level stop loss cover as a backup to deal with the possibility 
            |f very large claim liabilities.////


            |Highmark likely cedes risk to reinsurers using quota-share specific excess of loss (eg reinsurer assumes 40% risk u
            | to $2 million, 100% to $5 million, 0% after) and aggregate excess loss (eg reinsurer assumes 40% of the aggregate 
            |top loss coverage sold to self-funded employers). Or something like that - it can get complicated quickly.

                            |The problem is that by incrementally getting closer to the real thing, one might want to experience

                    |That sounds like people who say that videogames make people more violent. Pseudoscience and hearsay at best


                        |I believe the research started with cathartic behavior.  It turns out that punching a punching bag when

                            |Yeah, but this doesn't disprove the point. Sure people who punch the punching bag rather than holdi
                            |g it in are more violent. But the real question is if a person on the verge of violence can use a p

                            |ng applies to sexual fetishes/orientation(I don't think it will). All in all there is a great deal 
                            |f difference between that study and what we are discussing.


                                |Well, I look at it like this, if you have sexual thoughts about children the doll will not give
                                |you a safe outlet, it will make you more likely to act on those thoughts in the future.  You ar

                        |Not really. There's very little reality in video game violence, and the disconnect between using a cont
                        |oller or mouse and keyboard, and shooting a gun or using some other weapon, is huge. Here, you're commi
                        |ting the same act in the same manner, the difference being the inanimate object in place of a child.


                        |Its not even complete pseudoscience about video games. It desensitizes people. You're unwillingness to

                            |Desensitizing doesn't lead people to commit crimes though. Anyone who has ever used the internet ca
                            | attest to that.


                        |I think most people on BOTH SIDES just give knee jerk reactions whenever the violence and video game de
                        |ate comes up. Sure, they may not provoke violence now, when it's very easy to distance yourself from th
                        | game. Look away from the screen, turn it off, and things like that. But what's going to happen when th
                        | simulations get better and better? Especially with the Oculus Rift and the potential VR market we may 
                        |e about to enter. Sure, killing some people in GTA is good for a laugh and some mindless fun, but what 
                        |ill happen when the simulation is photo realistic, and the magic of VR has you completely immersed in t
                        |e simulation. I genuinely think there will be psychological implications to such a scenario. And the sc
                        |ry thing is, this technology isn't improbable, or even far away. Give it a decade or two and we'll like

                                |to blur that distinction as much as possible.

                                        |I agree with you for the most part, I just think it's silly for people to take a 100% s

                                        |s from the defensive side - it's like people who own pitbulls always yelling that they

                                        |the more immersive games will be. I do *not* think that playing video games makes peopl
                                        | violent, that's stupid. But I also think it's wrong to say that there's no correlation


                                |I think the oposite will happen, instead of bringing the violence out, it snuffs it out.////Whe

                            |Please note that I never said they promote violence now. I specifically said that in the near futur
                            | technology will get to the point where will be able to create virtual reality simulations that wil
                            | be so immersive that it is difficult to distinguish it from reality. When this happens, I firmly b
                            |lieve there will be psychological implications to consider. I also want to make sure I make clear t
                            |is does not only extend to violence, but a broad range of consequences to consider. Violence is one
                            |consideration, but it lies at an extreme end. Other considerations are people being exposed to inte
                            |se material, and possibly having a traumatic response, or even PTSD. Imagine a simulation that is s
                            | perfect sound and audio are indistinguishable from reality. Now imagine a racing game played in th
                            | first person, where the player is made to feel like they are flying through the track at 200 MPH, 
                            |hen suddenly they lose control of the vehicle and crash at an extreme speed, with the car flipping 
                            |nd over end. This experience in the first person with a perfect simulation would be extremely inten
                            |e, and could cause a person to develop an anxiety to cars. This is just one example off the top of 
                            |y head. Others might include war games, torture scenes, or horror games.


                            |Violent video games don't normalize the behavior.  They do help you make snap decisions much faster
                            | however.  In a fight or flight situation where flight isn't possible or is more dangerous, violent
                            |video games do make it easier to make the decision to injure or kill another human being.  ////So b

                        |As far as normalizing a particular behavior such as violence goes, there's probably a slight difference

                    |It might also have the opposite effect. If someone that has those urges gets one of these and tries it and

        |Remember that this is the most important socialist critique against capitalism. Employees are exploited by employers be
        |ause they have nowhere else to go but to sell their labor. Which is made even worse by the fact that there are so few j
        |bs available today, which means that employers have it easier to pick employees who agree to low salaries. This is unle
        |s you are highly educated and have an area of expertise in which you are hotly demanded, but even here we see that the 
        |iddle-class is declining. At the expense of the workers the employers are thus fattening their own wallets as well as t
        |e fact that workers have little ability to influence their own workplace and labor. Whenever socialists talk about expl
        |itation, this is it.


            |And this is also why actual functioning unions are important.


            |The poor stay poor because labor is cheap and ideas are expensive.  How do you get rich?  I have no idea.


                |The poor are getting richer becuase they are taking jobs for the 1%.  How much do you need to earn to be among 
                |he top 1% of the world?  $34,000.


            |No one is forced to take part in the capitalist system. For decades after the US was founded, people who didn't wan
            | to work for others could just strike out for the frontier and homestead their own farm. They'd produce everything 
            |hey needed for themselves and sell whatever excess they had locally. Then the market revolution happened and people
            |realized they could gain access to a greater diversity of high quality factory made goods if they took part in the 
            |ystem.////Land is still relatively cheap in America, so people could potentially still choose to live support thems
            |lves without being beholden to an employer or a bank if they wanted to. But people choose not to because they eithe
            | do not have the skills to survive on a farm or they realize they value access to modern amenities more than they v
            |lue complete independence.


            |Is the alternative anarcho-syndicalism?

                        |Id recommend going to r/anarchism101 with a question like that. Basically though it is a system of soci

            |In a free market, self-employment *is* an option.


                |Even in a free market, self-employment is only an option for those who have the funds to start up a business. A
                | the adage goes, "You've gotta have money to make money."////I would assume your free market does not include a
                |robust welfare system, either. This means that, not only do you have to be able to come up with the money to st
                |rt the business, but you also will have to have a decent amount stored up for security in the event your busine
                |s fails, further raising the cost of entry to the "free market."////Assuming one even has these things, he also
                |has to have  knowledge of some sort. He'll need to know how to do whatever it is his business does. He'll need 
                |o be able to manage the books, to manage the business, to successfully navigate the market, see trends, etc. He
                |ll have to be able to see when a risk is too big, or what the potential ROI on an investment might be.////He al
                |o has to be mentally able, and intelligent enough. He has to be physically able to run a business as well.////O
                | course, how is he going to learn all this stuff? Maybe he will need to hire people who do know this stuff. But
                |that means he has to pay them. Money, money, money.////Finally, of course, there's the element of luck. He's go

                |e. Free market capitalism is very, very good for those who have money; it sucks for those who don't.


                    |No, you don't need money in order to make money. If you are smart, have a good idea, and can show investors
                    |why its worthwhile to invest in you, then you can get capital. You then use this capital to pay people who 
                    |ave skills to work for you, assuming you don't have the knowledge or skills yourself. If you can't convince
                    |anyone to grant you any capital, that's a signal that you should rethink your idea.////Yes, sometimes busin
                    |sses fail because of bad luck, like a fire or something. That's what insurance is for. Any good businessper
                    |on understands the need for insurance. Furthermore, if you can't get affordable insurance for your business
                    | then that's a signal that you're in the wrong business.////But yes, overall starting a business is very ri
                    |ky; too risky for people who can't afford to take such risks. But it's a fair tradeoff. People who can take
                    |risks and choose to do so can be rewarded with wealth and independence. Or they can be wiped out, regardles
                    | of all their privilege. On the other hand, people who can't afford to take risks have to settle for a stab
                    |e, predictable job. That's life, and I don't think it's unfair.

                            |monopoly (or oligopoly) prices replacing competitive prices, a uniform rate of profit gives way to 
                            | hierarchy of profit rates—highest in the most concentrated industries, lowest in the most competit
                            |ve. This means that the distribution of surplus value is skewed in favor of the larger units of cap
                            |tal which characteristically accumulate a greater proportion of their profits than smaller units of
                            |capital, once again making possible a higher rate of accumulation.//&gt;//&gt;(3) On the demand sid
                            | of the accumulation equation, monopolistic industries adopt a policy of slowing down and carefully

                                |Hmm, that's interesting. Companies that earn more money reinvest that money to give themselves 
                                | competitive advantage. They then use their advantage to drive their competitors out of busines
                                |, eventually creating a monopoly. Let's call it the Walmart way of business. Being a monopoly t

                                        |can see this in action now with iTunes and Netflix. When iTunes debuted, record labels 
                                        |ere willing to allow Apple to sell individual songs at $1 a piece, which freed consumer
                                        | from having to buy entire records at full price that contained only 1 or 2 good, desir
                                        |ble songs. Quickly iTunes became a disproportionately huge distributor, and the record 
                                        |abels lost almost all their pricing power. The result was that the recording industry l
                                        |st tons of money. The movie industry learned from this, and realized the same would hap

                                        |oming a monopoly.////In some industries, there may be a natural tendency toward monopol

            |gs, plus overhead (management, accounting, legal, etc.) and *still* have money left over to give you a paycheck to 
            |ake home, as a result of the greatly increased productivity of your labor working for them compared to what you cou
            |d do alone.////If you don't work in a factory, the specifics are different, but the general story still applies. Em
            |loyment is more than just a trade of labor for money; it's an exchange that greatly increases what you can *do* wit
            | your labor, so that the laborer and the employer both profit. This advantage depends on the accumulation and conve
            |gence of things (physical things like the building and the machines, but also intangible things like branding and e
            |tablished customer relationships) known as "capital", which is why the system has become known (inaccurately, in my
            |opinion) as "capitalism".

            |The number of employers in the economy is not set in stone.  A person becomes an employer only if it is economicall

            |aid leave, mandated benefits, overtime, equal pay, union powers, etc.) makes it less attractive to BE an employer, 
            |esulting in fewer employers, meaning fewer employers are completing with each other to hire a larger number of work
            |rs, resulting in lower wages for the workers.

            |is mean that by extending any employment offer that is accepted, the employer is doing more to help the employee th
            |n he would be if he didn't exist or didn't extend the offer at all?  And isn't he doing more to make the employee's

                |Tyler tugged nervously at his tie to give himself some air to breathe. The suit he had hired for his first job 
                |nterview was itching and he was sweating profusely. *Maybe there's been a mistake*, he thought, glancing at his
                |watch and seeing that the interview should have started two minutes ago.////After another ten minutes Tyler tho
                |ght about leaving. *Why did I even bother? A kid like me, getting hired straight out of college by one of the b
                |ggest companies in America? Yeah, not likely*. But then he remembered the pile of bills stacking up, if he didn
                |t get this job he'd be evicted soon. *I'll give it another five minutes*.////Just when he stood up to leave, an
                |ther full thirty minutes later, the door to the office swung open and a young female assistant stepped out. "Mr

                |n until he was about to leave.////A puff of black smoke blew in his face when Tyler entered the office, making 
                |yler cough profusely. "Tyler, was it?" The smoke dispersed and Tyler could see a slightly fat man sitting in an
                |armchair with his feet on his desk, puffing on a cigar.////"Y- yeah." Tyler coughed, trying to keep his eyes fr
                |m watering. "I'm here for the-."////"It doesn't matter what position you're here for." Palmer cut him off. "You
                |want money and I've got money, isn't that right?"////Tyler fumbled for words, the speech he had prepared for th
                | interview suddenly seeming completely useless. "Uh... Yes, I suppose it is."////"Good!" Palmer proclaimed with
                |a wide grin on his face. "Then lick my boots."////"I'm sorry, what?" Said a confused Tyler.////"I asked you to 
                |ick my boots. You need the money, don't you?"////"You'll give me money to... lick your boots?" Tyler frowned, n
                |t knowing what to make of this strange man, but his attitude quickly changed when Palmer pulled a crisp fifty d
                |llar bill out of his pocket.////"Oh, he's got it now! Yes!" Palmer chuckled, dangling his feet over the table./
                |//"Alright... I'll do it." Tyler leaned forward and gave the boots a couple of good licks, careful not to displ
                |ase Palmer by stopping to early.////"Aahh, that wasn't so bad was it?" Palmer grinned and gave Tyler the fifty.
                |"Now that we've established that you're willing to play, the rest is just a matter of price, isn't it?"////"'Wi

                |r in his desk. "... this puppy for five hundred bucks?" He placed an adorable black Labrador puppy on his desk,
                |along with ten more fifty dollar bills. ////"What are you crazy?" Tyler laughed. "You're kidding, right? I'm no
                | going to shoot a puppy, that's sick."////"Of course you are!" Palmer said and winked. "How does 5000 dollars s

                |ger. "What is wrong with you? It's not a matter of prize, I'm not going to kill a fucking puppy!"////Palmer sig
                |ed and rolled his eyes. "Fifty thousand dollars, how does that sound? Think what you could do with fifty thousa
                |d dollars. You could buy a car or an apartment. You could even donate it to an animal shelter and save the life
                |of a hundred puppies, eh?"////Sweat poured down Tyler's brow as he began to pace the office back and forth. "Yo
                |'ll give me fifty thousand to kill a puppy?" The puppy let out a little whimper and tried run to Tyler, wagging
                |it's tail. "That's sick. *You're sick*."////"Ah, but we're getting closer, aren't we?" Palmer grinned and reach
                |d into his drawers, pulling out five large stacks of money. "One hundred thousand dollars. If I hired you, you 
                |ouldn't make this money in two years."////Tyler's eyes flicked nervously between the puppy, the money and the g
                |n on the floor, lingering a little longer on the money than the other two. He suddenly strode forward, his face
                |a stony mask, and grabbed the puppy off the desk, cradling it in his arms on the floor.////"I'm sorry." Tyler w
                |ispered and took the gun off the floor and pushed it into the dogs gut. It began to yap and lick his hand happi
                |y. Tyler shook his head. "I can't do it. I can't fucking do it. This is insane."////He looked up to see Palmer 
                |inking at him and adding a few more stacks to the growing pile of money on the table. "I thought you might say 
                |hat, so I added a little bit more... incentive."////Tyler looked away from the dog, the hand holding the gun sh
                |king violently. "Do it. Do it. Do it." He muttered and then the gun went off with a loud bang. The puppy fell l
                |mp in Tyler's arms with a gaping wound in its stomach and Tyler began to cry.////"I'm sorry." He whispered in t
                |e puppy's ear. He sat in silenced for a few minutes before he stood up and wiped his tears.////"Can I go now? C
                |n I please just leave?"////Palmer gave a friendly smile and puffed his cigar. "Of course you can leave, m'boy! 
                |ou can leave whenever you want!" He began to shovel the stacks of money into a plastic bag with his wide arms a
                |d handed it to Tyler over the desk. "Here you go."////Tyler left the gun on the table and took the dog and the 
                |oney, turning to leave without another word. Just as he was about to shut the door behind him, Palmer's voice m
                |de Tyler stop.////"Oh, one more thing." The voice said. "You wouldn't happen to be interested in making ten mil

                        |ay. I took a big ass rip, and as soon as I passed the bowl I zoned out into this crazy swirling place t

                        |. I pulled myself out of this vortex to realize that I was laughing uncontrollably. We all got out of t
                        |e car. I pushed my friend into the grass. One of us got ontop of the car and started jumping up and dow
                        |. I followed. Soon all of us were jumping up and down on the car. Then someone threw a lighter, and sha
                        |tered the glass pane on the garage. We all got in the car and started *driving* (!) About a block away,
                        |3 of us got out at the park because they didn't want to be driving like this. I stayed. Then I came bac
                        | to reality. I had my friend drive me home and went to sleep.////The funny thing is that the across-the
                        |street neighbors were outside and witnessed the whole thing. Who knows what the hell they thought. Salv

                        |hale.  So i pack it and light it and 10 seconds later everybody is yelling at me and calling me names s
                        | i run out freaking and i go 'i gotta get out of here!' And the guy who smoked after me comes out walki

                        |e goes 'you ain't goin nowhere!' And then i ran out into a foot of snow in socks until my friends talke
                        | me down.  Turns out everyone in the room was just laughing cause they couldn't understand me and i was
                        |drooling everywhere.////The good story is i thought i was space, like outer space.  Everyone i moved ri
                        |ht i went to a different universe and if i moved left i could look around the universe.////And the bori
                        |g story is me and my friend drooled and tried to light a cigarette for 20 minutes but when we moved our
                        |faces up to the flame my hand with the lighter moved forward as well.  Good times.

                |It was always strange, but never bad. I came out thinking "well that was strange, lets try again"


                |Chewing it ain't all bad. Get a belly ache though, and only seem to "see" shit if you close your eyes or are in

                        |Yeah, a lot of salvia trips is you suddenly attaining consciousness and fighting to keep it but knowing
                        |you are going back out.


                    |Yeah I consider myself a pretty damn good drug connoisseur and salvia fucked with my mind too much. I would
                    |'t call it a bad trip, because I was pretty much expecting what happened, but completely losing control of 
                    |our mind can be pretty terrifying for a while.


                        |losing control isn't terrifying, it's afterwards when you realize that there was no such thing as your

                    |I come out laughing hysterically to the point of tears. Not really sure why. The trips aren't even remotely

        |What is it?


        |I want to try it so bad. Any advice ?


        |Shit made me facehead.////Also, everything went cupcake.


        |Salvia, in case you haven't tried it, has no positive feeling associated with taking it, there is no euphoria, relaxati
        |n, or 'upper' effect. In fact it can be quite an unpleasant experience.////When I tried salvia, my vision split into ma
        |y lenses (like the way a fly would see) and had the impression of being in an evil clown circus. I spent like 15 minute
        | stumbling from the bed to the kitchen feeling uncomfortably warm. Wasn't pleasant and I don't see the point of taking 


        |I just smoked some salvia I bought years ago when it was still legal. Forgot how intense it is...I was made out of Lego
        |bricks for at least 10 minutes there.


        |Fuck yeah it is. Oh god. I tried once, never again.////Early in the night, I smoked just a small amount, and simply cou
        |dn't really speak, and felt as though I was suddenly sitting on a hill, and if I let myself relax I would roll across t
        |e ground naturally, with zero effort. Yeah. It was weird, but fun.////So later, I wanted to try a higher dose, and mayb
        | get some of the crazy stuff I'd heard about. I took quite a large bong rip of it this time. I was alright for a minute
        | just everything felt like it was shifting to the left, and I was being pulled to the right.////And then all of a sudde
        | I was pulled very hard into the couch, and things started getting weird. The entire scene surrounding me, a living roo
        | with friends in it, slowly started moving to the left, leaving my vision. At the same time, another, entirely differen
        | scene filled with different people was coming in from the right. I was very confused with what was happening, but once
        |the new scene had almost entirely replaced the old, I realized something: I recognized this new place, and these people
        | But at the same time, I didn't really. It felt almost as if they were characters from a favorite show, only they weren
        |t, and in that moment I even had some fully-formed memories of some of them.////That's when I started freaking out. I r
        |asoned that I *must* be completely insane, and was somehow living two entirely separate realities, one in the real worl
        |, and one in some weird, deep part of my brain. And then I started worrying that if I let this place come all the way i
        | and replace the living room, I would be stuck there forever; that I would be some sort of vegetable living in a differ
        |nt reality inside of my brain *for the rest of my life*. I was most definitely not chill with that.////The living room 
        |as only the tiniest sliver at the edge of my vision at this point, but I needed desperately to get back there. I starte
        | mentally clawing at it, pulling it back towards me. It was very difficult, and try as I might it stretched towards me 
        |t what seemed like a snail's pace. It spaghettied at me until eventually I made it back, seemingly something like twent
        | minutes later. I remember screaming the entire time. ////When I got back, I was sure it was over, but my head felt fra
        |mented. Like there was a chasm right through the center, and the two sides were at different levels. I don't know how e
        |se to describe it. I freaked out that I had permanent brain damage until a friend politely reminded me, "you're still t
        |ipping," and that snapped me out of it.////I stood up and was drawn towards the kitchen, like I literally could not not
        |go in that direction. While I walked through the house, I apologized to everyone for screaming south while I was pullin
        | back to reality. Turns out I was actually silent the whole time.////There ended up being a video of the ordeal, which 
        | found out about later and watched. As I said, the entire thing felt like it took forever, but in reality was about fif
        |een seconds. Fuck that.


        |Craziest shit I've seen in my life is when I've been on salvia and have had many memorable trips, I'll detail some of t
        |em. ////1)I saw a row of hedges in my room and I morphed into the hedges that was zooming around like warp-speed 5 on t
        |e Star Trek Enterprise and morphed back where I hallucinated that my dad watching me. I told him to fuck off and go hom
        | and he faded off. I looked behind me and saw a dozen hands reaching out to grab me from out of the window. I came out 
        |f my trip and it was half an hour later. (This was on x40 salvia)////2) I took a bong rip and layed back laughing; I lo
        |ked to the side and saw a shadow. Somehow my brain knew that it was a Siberian Policeman and I had to take a piss test 
        |r I would be in trouble. I walked over to a lampshade and almost pissed in it before my friends pushed me back down on 
        |he chair. (x40)////3) I was sitting in a car, and suddenly my had zoomed forward, a tunnel that opened to a mountain th
        |t was crested at the bottom, appeared on a field of vision that I could perceive but also overlapped on reality. It was
        |like seeing two planes of existence at the same time! I somehow knew that the mountain was a symbolic meaning of my lif
        |, my existence. It was a spirit of the essence of life and I knew it's name was Apé Sekwas.  I then knew the undeniable
        |truth, I was Apé Sekwas. I probably said the name over and over again 200 times. It was my mantra; I knew nobody else u
        |derstood but I would be a prophet and explain to everyone that the spirit was part of everything, it was the universe, 
        |he world, every person. ////Of all of my trips number 3 was the one that changed my life, I realized that planet is int
        |rconnected and that everyone and everything is part of a whole. A void. 


        |I was so excited at the idea of purchasing human saliva that, greeted by some psychoactive sage, I was vaguely disappoi
        |ted. Still, shit IS crazy.


        |&gt;  Its effects are considered unpleasant by many people.////This for some reason makes me want to try it.


        |I read that as saliva, though they probably sell that on the internet too.


        |One of my buddies wanted to smoke salvia because he thought it would be kind of like weed. NOOOOOO. We ended up smoking
        |it and it was fucking insane. 


        |Worst experience of my life. I had a panic attack after visiting an unavoidable, hell-like afterlife and learning that 
        |t was always there, under the surface of our current experiences.


        |Thought I read saliva, was very confused. I wouldn't be surprised if you could buy that either though.


        |Oh not crazy. JUST FUCKING HORRIBLE!!! I had the worst "trip" of all time. 


        |Salvia is definitely weird, but I think that Spice crap is 10x crazier.


        |I don't use any drugs, but while in Montreal my buddies bought some from a shop and tried it. I didn't even know they t
        |ok it, but my friend said it was one of the scariest trips of his life. To quote him: "I thought I was a piece of pizza
        |in a box and I couldn't move, I was falling through space as a pizza."  


        |Your comment made me remember my trip. [I drew it.](http://i.imgur.com/Mci76XA.jpg)


        |So why would anyone wanna buy this if its effect is unpleasant, as stated in that website?


        |Ive tried salvia several dozen times from different sources - it just doesn't hit me hard. At best it makes me mildly u

                |Let's say, twenty years from now, Bitcoin becomes a normal and widely used currency, and a large part of the wo
                |ld's population uses it. That would mean that almost all 21 million Bitcoins (let's say 20 million) are in circ
                |lation. ////Divide this by (let's say) 7.000.000.000 people (which is not all of Earth's population, due to a r
                |se in population during these twenty years) and you get an average of 0.004 bitcoins.////Now, if we take 1 Bitc
                |in and divide it by 0.004, we get 250. That means that if you buy one Bitcoin today, you would be 250 times as 
                |ich as the average person in twenty years.////I'm not sure if this math is correct, and feel free to correct me
                |if it isn't, but I think it gives an idea of how good of an idea it would be to invest a few dollars in a Bitco

        |ll struggle. Charge per Night is as low as $1 (yes that is 1 USD, cause in local currency that is equal to 100 Rupees).
        |This charge is in Kathmandu (which is the capital and has highest-cost-of-living). In other cities, charge for hiring a
        |prostitute for one night is as low as 10 cents. ////Mostly it is due to poverty, which drives these women into doing an
        |thing for any amount they can so that they can make ends meet. ////Source: I worked for agency, which helped rehabilita
