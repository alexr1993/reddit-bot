ELI5: what will probably happen in Europe if USA goes in default?(/r/Explain Like I'm Five | Don't Panic!)




    |[Bloomberg has referred to that possibility as 'an economic calamity like none the world has ever seen](http://www.bloomber
    |.com/news/2013-10-07/a-u-s-default-seen-as-catastrophe-dwarfing-lehman-s-fall.html)////In short, all the European markets, 
    |ndustries, governments, and banks that have positions that rely on the US economic engine will be damaged - investments int
    | US T-bonds will be relatively worthless, and as the US markets crash, so will any european markets that rely on the US mar
    |ets for stability.////In short, it would fuck everyone////---////Edit: Since people are seeing this post, **[read this](htt
    |://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt)**  -  its a summary of how much each country h
    |s in Treasury notes in the US, and should give a better idea of exactly how much money is riding on this not going to shit.

    |wledge, my experience in the finance sector (for my small part in it), and some general analysis on what seems to be the mo
    |t correct as far as answers go. I openly welcome critique and corrections to anything I've posted.////---////Final Edit: Th
    | level of fuckery that might occur in the event of the default is beyond me - it might indeed be a 'blip' as some people ha
    |e described, it might be catastrophic as others have described. I'll leave that sort of analysis and conversation to season
    |d economists. My point is that there's going to be some level of fucking happening on a global scale, with varying levels o
    | pain. A simple tl;dr would be that *its not going to be pretty*.////---////A thought occurs to me - consider the debt-limi
    | crisis to be a bull charging straight for you. IF it hits you, there is going to be pain to you, and the people around you
    |who your flying body will strike.////Now you have choices - you can get out of the way of the bull, and perhaps return to f
    |gure out why the bull was charging you in the first place to deal with that issue, or let the bull strike you and try to fi
    |ure it out in the hospital.////From my personal perspective, I can't see a good reason for getting hit by the bull - I'd ra
    |her get away from the bull, then poke it with a stick from a safe distance until I can figure out how to make it less of a 
    |hreat to my squishy bits.////---/////u/Ransom009 posted **[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1o8nzc/

    |p://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1o8nzc/eli5_what_will_probably_happen_in_europe_if_usa/ccpy6kn)** about how
    |the default might actually happen, at least as far as the effect on the Treasury and the value of T-bonds/////u/mercurycc  
    |osted **[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1o8nzc/eli5_what_will_probably_happen_in_europe_if_usa/cc
    |wmkf)** some info on the concept of financing that might answer questions as far as 'why don't we just get rid of the debt'
    |or 'why do we need the debt', so on and so forth.


        |To clarify how the "default" might actually happen, the Treasury will announce on the day of maturity whether they are 
        |oing to pay the principal for each bond. At that point, they will extend the new maturity day-by-day until they finally
        |make the payment. So, it's unlikely that this will be a TRUE default where no one gets their principal money back, but 
        |he bonds will be tremendously devalued, and the entire credibility of our treasury as a reputable lender will fall. Thi
        | will cause future bonds auctioned by the Treasury to be less valuable as well, etc. etc. It's a slippery slope and not
        |something we want to test.


            |Isn't the damage already done to some degree? Clearly we are madmen willing to dance this insane macabre dance for 
            |olitical tomfoolery.


                |It's bad, but a likely empty threat of default for political reasons and actually  defaulting are two very diff
                |rent things. 


                |That's exactly why many (such as the Chinese) were playing with shifting the focus of their reserves from treas
                |ries to euro bonds. But when Greece threw a spanner in the works the euro lost a lot of clout as a possible rep
                |acement. There isn't really anyone else who looks stable enough to trust anymore, though the Japanese have seen
                |a rising demand for their bonds.


                    |Euro's getting better now. Like, Merkel has 4 more years, there should be more political drive for the Euro
                    |one to do shit; so long as they do it through extra cooperative measures (*Cough* Ignore the UK).////We'll 
                    |ee. The Euro may look tastier in the coming year/Years, where as there doesn't seem to be a solution to the
                    |American legislative problem.


                |Yes to some damage, most notably in the form of [downgrades in the credit rating by rating agencies](http://en.
                |ikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_credit-rating_downgrade) from the last time this happened, w
                |ich consequences are outlined somewhat in the link.


                |I, too, have a thesaurus! Thimble.


            |We don't want to test it but some congress don't seem to mind playing with the idea.


            |No slippery slope at all, in my view: maturity extension can still be understood as defaulting as far as CDS trigge
            |s are concerned, and the real problem here is, in my view, not really the US debt notes (they might not be paid now
            | but they eventually will, as the default event is not the  result of an intrinsic inability to pay, but rather fro
            | political posturing and wrangling) but all the CDS hedges, as, if those get triggered, pretty much every bank arou
            |d will be hit for "fuck-you" money that they don't actually have.


        |What about China? I know USA has some kind of debts with them


            |The same - there are not a lot of nations, banks, financial institutions, or other large corporations who do not ha
            |e some stake in the US not paying their debts, whether it be in T-Bonds, loans, stock / commodity ownership, etc.//
            |/The way I described it once before is like a Jenga tower - imagine US and other superpower nations are like the bo
            |tom blocks, and other nations are like the top blocks. The top blocks (like Greece) might get pulled and cause inst
            |bility that trickles down to the bottom blocks, but nothing too severe.////Take out one of the bottom blocks, howev
            |r, and the entire tower's stability is reduced.////In this case, taking out the US is not only like taking out a bo
            |tom block, its like doing that in the middle of an earthquake, while there's a tornado, during a swat raid. That to
            |er is going to be *rocking*, and in the form of the global economy, nothing good will come of that.////I might be e
            |aggerating here, but in general, there will not be many nations that are not effected by the US going into default.
            |The magnitude of damage will depend on each countries dependence on US economic stability.


                |Please pardon this really dumb question... If everyone fails at the same time, and so much of the economy (appe
                |rs to be?) more theoretical than hard money, why would it be so hard to start over? Doesn't there need to be so
                |e country left with enough economical integrity to keep us tethered to this system that's about to completely f
                |ll apart?


                    |The current affluent society is upheld by a system of credits. For example, say I need a car to get to work
                    | but I can't get a car until I work for the next 5 years. This is a catch 22 since I can't work without a c
                    |r. Here, a dozen other people (through a bank) decide to help you pay for your car with the expectation tha
                    | you will repay them in 5 years, and the economy gains you as a worker and you gain a new car. If the credi
                    | system goes down, this "theoretical" money no longer exists, and the economy is down a worker and you're d
                    |wn a car, which means the car company sells one less car, which means the car company's employees and car p
                    |rts company lose out, etc etc, resulting in a "slower" economy. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_mo
                    |ey////Also, there really is no such thing as "hard money" in that money no longer means anything other than
                    |what people agree on. The old "hard money" system of a bill representing x amount of gold was abandoned som
                    | decades ago. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard


                        |Any chance of us returning to a hard money system, not necessarily based on money, but maybe something 
                        |lse?  Or did we collectively decide that it's just a bad idea in general?


                            |The gold standard has a whole host of problems. Perhaps the biggest one is that it prevents nations
                            |from engaging in monetary policy other than breaking the gold standard.  The fed wouldn't be able t
                            | control interest rates, which would exacerbate downturns.  It is also deflationary, since the disc
                            |very of new gold is slower than the growth rate of GDP.


                            |One thing with a hard currentcy is that it's finite, you can never get more of it. It sounds great,
                            |when you think about it, it's terrible. As more people enter the work force, the reserve of these c
                            |rrentcies dries up. Say, for sake of simplicity, we have a town that has 100 gold pieces split amon
                            |st 100 people and the gold continuiously circulates from shop owner to worker to shop owner to farm
                            |r to worker (pretty much owner of one buisness pays his worker who buys goods from another shop who
                            |uses this to buy their goods for sale from a supplier who pays his worker who then in turns buys go
                            |ds from the original shop owner). Well, what happens when the population goes up five people who wo

                            |rd people are talking about. We will run out of gold/silver/platinum for our currentcy, which means
                            |the notes will be worth less gold per note or we have a stagnate economy that can't grow because th
                            | supply of money.////Then we get into the issue that most of the stuff that we can use as currentcy
                            |has other uses besides being money and looking pretty. Gold, silver and platinum are industrial met

                                |ve their faults, but now I see that hard money is very limiting if you are looking for economic

                                    |Yeah, robots.  We keep building them.  They get smarter.  They destroy us all and take over
                                    |the world.  We no longer need money.

                                    |That's not the point. The point is that you can't control how much gold there is because it
                                    |s a physical object, which means you can't control inflation (less people or a sudden large

                                    |not usually necessary, it is sometimes crucial to control how much money is in the economy.

            |The idea that China "owns" the US since they own a ton of Treasuries is completely overblown.  The US gets the bett
            |r of that deal all day everyday.  


                |can you elaborate ?


                    |The US economy is constantly growing, and we inflate our currency to match. If the borrowed money produces 
                    |reater growth than inflation then the US is winning value-wise, because the dollars it ultimately gives awa
                    | are worth less.


                    |the interest rate is so low, (lower than inflation), (0.2%?).////That means that lenders to the US govt (bu

                        |You're correct, but the Chinese see this as buying "influence", not necessarily as an investment. Shoul
                        | they actually get a sizeable dollar reserve, they could harm the US economy by massively dumping dolla
                        |s on the financial markets. Which of course would be suicidal, since they'd be selling their own assets
                        |with losses and effects on them would be way more severe than just a depreciation of the dollar.


            |Pretty much everyone would be fucked. The US has investments in so many countries, and vice versa, that the entire 
            |lobal economy would most likely sink into recession, and if you thought the last one was bad, this would be far wor
            |e than that was.


            |About 1.3t worth...Japan and China have both urged the US to figure this shit out


            |China is a little different. They keep their currency at a fixed exchange rate relative to the dollar. They do this
            |to encourage a high deficit between the US and China. It makes selling their goods to the states much cheaper. It u
            |ed to be a set point that only varied if the central bank allowed it but is now allowed to fluctuate by 1% from a s
            |t point.////So if our currency crashes, and if we default it would crash, China has two options. First is stay fixe
            | in which case they crash as well. Their purchasing power within their own country and from other countries goes do
            |n. They would suffer probably more than we would. Second is to detach from the dollar and either attach it to the E
            |ro, problematic in more ways than one, or allow it to be valued by the market. If that happens then China will beco
            |e much stronger in terms of their financial position but their goods will no longer be cheap so they will have trou

        |investments might not be paid back. ////Shit hitting fans? Not even close to describing the chaos that would follow. 


            |The treasury bill has never been safe.  In fact, it has been quite the opposite.  Historically it has always lost t

                |Not what that means.


        |A default does not mean all treasuries are worthless.  Far from it.  The defaulted securities still have value (there i
        | a recovery process). And all the other non-defaulted securities still have value, which depends on how likely market p
        |rticipants think the US is likely to pay out on the bond (eventually).  Which is very likely to be the full amount.////
        |ou'd rather own a busted bond from a rich guy who had some technical problems getting the payment out, than a bond from
        |a bankrupt guy who doesn't have the funds to pay.////In other words, a default would be bad but it should not be a cata
        |trophe.//


        |I can't reference the source because I forgot where i read it, but I did read that weeks before the shutdown both democ

            |A Treasury Note is something that an external agent to the government buys. It's (essentially) an IOU that states '
            |lease give us this amount of money, and in return, in X years, we will give you the amount back plus Y%".////T-bond

            |e its backed by the government itself.////[You can read up on it here](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasury
            |ote.asp). As far as Ireland is concerned, if there are $93.2bn in T-notes that have been bought, then at the end of
            |that maturity, that 93.2bn would be returned with the additional yield on the bonds purchased. I do not believe the
            |e is a way to get the money out earlier, other than selling the bond to someone else at a lower value than its actu
            |l worth (e.g. selling the 93.2bn in bonds to another stakeholder, say China, for 80bn or something to that effect).

        |you come upon the phrase?


        |I studied macro-economics, but don't have much experience. So don't automatically accept this as "truth".////This post 
        |ill be structured in 2 parts:////* Who owns the debt by the government//* What would the effects be of defaulting//////
        |/The US defaulting on its debts has both internal and external effects. The total of US government debt is over $ 16.7 
        |rillion. Of that debt, $ 4.8 trillion is owned by governmental agencies. ////This includes agencies such as the social 
        |ecurity (holds over $2.5 trillion dollars).////Of the public debt, $5.7 trillion is owned by foreign investors.////**Ke
        |p in mind this is just the actual government debt, effects of a default would be much bigger**////Now, what would happe
        | in case of a default? Let's assume you own a  $1000 bond by the US government. You might think it's just paper, but th
        |t'd be wrong. After all, you *paid* for that paper. Just like an iPod is worth $500 or whatever because that's what you
        |paid for it. Bonds are means of (safe) investment.////Now, government defaults. You, the owner of the government bond a
        |e unsure about whether you will actually ever get your money back, so you're freaking out. Then some dude comes to you 
        |nd says "hey, I'll pay you $500 for that bond!". You figure "better be sure" and accept it (this 50% depreciation is co
        |pletely arbitrary).////Now, let's assume everyone reacts like you do (which is entirely unlikely but let's assume so fo
        | sake of simplicity). Consequence: the value of the government debt drops by 50% for the *owners* of that debt. Social 
        |ecurity loses over $ 1 trillion, other government agencies or internal investors lose a combined $3 trillion.////To put
        |this in perspective, this is roughly **$10 000** per American for a 50% drop. Even assuming just a 1% drop, it'd still 
        |e $200 for *every* American out there. Family with 3 kids? Well shucks, you just lost $1000 (in actual assets or in gov
        |rnment benefits, this is on a macro level).////Foreign owners of the debt would see the same effects: the value of thei
        | assets would fall. China owns $1 trillion in debt, so loses $500 billion. Same with Japan. Both countries have been ru
        |oured of being on the verge of an economic crisis, and this would definitely trigger it.////Worldwide, about $3 trillio
        | in assets would disappear. Again, assuming a 50% value drop which, again, is really unlikely.////Now, let's look at th
        | much major **second-order effects**. The dollar would drop in value... really hard. Since the dollar is basically the 
        |lobal reserve currency, a *lot* of foreign companies (be it from India, Bulgaria, Ecuador... you name it) have dollar b
        |nk accounts. ////Since the dollar would drop in value versus basically every other currency, a lot of those companies w

        |UNWILLING to honor commitments to US treasuries even when it it capable of honoring those commitments. There would be a
        |gradual international transition from using the dollar as the de facto international currency to something else. US tre

        |Yeah, **there's a 0% probability the United States can default on its debt** for 2 major reasons. One: the Constitution
        |l obligation to the debt. And two (a reason most people don't recognize): United States debt is made out in its own fre
        |-floating currency (the $dollar). If there was ever actually an emergency, we can issue more money to pay what's needed
        | So there's absolutely no way the US can default.//&gt; “The United States can pay any debt it has because we can alway
        | print money to do that. So there is zero probability of default.” Alan Greenspan//


        |This. I wish more people knew this. If there is any defaulting it will be on government programs that were in the budge
        | but now have to go.


            |People don't know it because it's completely untrue. Even if we did manage to prioritise all the funds to go to bon
            |holders (for which we do not have an apparatus currently in place), the government still would have to default on p
            |yments to contractors, social security obligations etc. This would certainly be treated like a default by the ratin
            |s agencies and the markets, which is the reason that [yields on short maturity bonds are already going up](http://w
            |w.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield), to protect against
            |the default risk. And let's also not forget the huge cut in government spending needed to do this would be austerit
            | on a far faster scale than previous budget cuts, the sequester, or even the dramatically fast pace of cuts in Gree
            |e, Ireland, Portugal right now, which would likely send us back into recession.////Edit: I also forgot to mention t
            |at it's illegal for a President to spend money on some parts of the budget and not others. Otherwise, a President c
            |uld just unilaterally underspend on the military (if they're a Democrat) or on social programs (if they're a Republ
            |can), and would unconstitutional neuter most of Congress' budgetary powers.


                |Virtually nothing of what you posted is true.


        |This is a classic example of the 'majority voice' (the most upvoted opinion on the thread) being a reflection of the se
        |sationalist media, and in no way the truth.////To begin with, the US reached its debt ceiling in 2012. The US constitut
        |on - 14th Amendment, Section 4 - directly forbids the government from defaulting on its debt. Thus to cope with the deb
        | ceiling being reached the government has been taking extraordinary measures in order to pay their debts (for instance 
        |uspending investments on individual pension funds). When these measures are exhausted, the government will not bring on
        |a global economic collapse as they default on all their bonds. They will just be forced to balance the economy - to mat
        |h their spending with their collected revenue. This is a very different issue (still with its problems) to a full defau
        |t.////What is important is that a full default will never happen! The brinksmanship between the rogue Republicans and t
        |e government would only threaten a 'technical' default on the shortest-dated US government bonds, because their shorter
        |lives mean their maturity date is nearer than the rest of the government's 'safe' assets. The problem here, as ever, is
        |not whether the federal government is able to repay the principle from these bonds, but the short-term methods used to 
        |ake these repayments. The US treasury would still be seen as a 'safe investment', albeit in more economically uncertain
        |times, and thus bonds would probably rise in price - believe it or not, the US government 10-year bond *decreased* in p
        |ice after news that the media reported a default was unlikely.////Though we are quick to forget, there have been 17 gov
        |rnment shutdowns between 1976-1996 and the debt ceiling is raised almost every year - a full default never happens. Thi
        | brinksmanship is historically common, and it is the media and politicians that fuel the political fire by indicating t
        |at this is the year where everything goes to hell. I am confident that [John Boehner has no intentions of actually forc
        |ng a full default](http://rt.com/usa/boehner-ask-debt-increase-989/). It is useful to learn to separate economics from 
        |olitics.////When the debt ceiling is eventually raised, even with the government still in shutdown, the US is in a posi
        |ion to see economic growth! Though short-term growth would be slightly limited by the shutdown, some of the previously 
        |bsent spending would be reinitiated, while projections indicate the fiscal drag (the damper on the economy caused by la
        |k of spending or excessive taxation) is going to [drop heavily by 2014](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-02/fed-s-
        |udley-predicts-faster-growth-in-2014-as-fiscal-drag-wanes.html). Either way, bond prices would still remain more expens
        |ve than stocks and remain a 'safe' asset.


            |OMG a poster who has a clue, didn't expect that here.


            |Did you even read Section 4 of the 14th Amendment?////&gt; SECTION 4.////&gt; The validity of the public debt of th

                |Good call Mama. Tell it like it is.


                |"Did you even read Section 4 of the 14th Amendment?"////Yes, I obviously have read it or I wouldn't be quoting 
                |t. This part of the constitution renders the government unable to 'question' the validity of their public debt.

                    |Questioning the validity of a debt and failing to make a payment towards it (i.e. defaulting) because of a 
                    |eficit are two very different things.////&gt; Not making debt ceilings unconstitutional, because debt ceili

                        |If you still don't understand it I'm not bothered to explain it. You claimed that debt limits/ceilings 
                        |ould be unconstitutional and that the part of constitution I quoted did not indicate that the governmen
                        | is forbidden from fully defaulting on their debts. I was correcting you on both accounts.

        |Yeah, it's such a clever lie by the liberal media that they've even got the global financial markets participating in i

    |I don't think "it won't happen" is an answer to your question, and I don't think "it's a disaster" is quite the specificity
    |you need. What you need to know is this: directly, 5-10 percent of the wealth on this planet is held as US government debt.
    |This shows up in pension funds, institutional investments, etc. China alone holds trillions. If the US govt refuses to pay 
    |bligations, the value of that paper decreases. This is an incredible shock to global wealth, directly. Indirectly, the inte
    |est rates on credit around the globe - home mortgages, car loans, and corporate borrowing rates - would soar, because inter
    |st is usually set as risk free + premium; that risk free is defined by US treasuries, and a default would send those rates 
    |oaring. If interest rates soar, companies with debt (pretty much all of them) see huge borrowing costs, and profits fall th
    |ough the floor. To get cash flow positive, companies have layoffs, but since unemployed people don't buy stuff, demand fall
    | too. You end up with a downward spiral, and we are all in trouble. ////So, in short, a default takes between 5 and 10 perc
    |nt of global wealth and puts it at risk. Then, it increases debt costs for anybody that has debt (everyone), which is an ev
    |n bigger problem because more cash has to go to banks to lend money, and less can be used for paying employees and reinvest
    |ng in the business. 


    |Not only Europe, but pretty much every single country in the world would be seriously screwed. ////Look at it in a smaller 
    |cale, Walmart in the USA. If Walmart was to go bankrupt, a very large amount of people would be out of jobs, and so would t
    |igger a chain reaction because bills would not be paid, things would not be bought, and would result in an extremely large 
    |mount of revenue gone. Many funds and people would lose a lot of money, and many more catastrophic financial issues would h
    |t. ////Edit: Comparing the US and Europe, and the rest of the world, using Walmart in the US, for simplistic purposes.  ///
    |P.s. Phenomenal question, friend. 


    |The short answer to this question is that a *genuine* and categorical  USA default would be very, very bad for the global e
    |onomy, and would probably trigger a worldwide depression. ////The longer and more informative answer requires unpacking a w
    |ole set of complex assumptions. Glossing over a lot of things for ELI5 purposes...////- Since roughly the end of WWI, and d
    |finitely since the end of WWII, USA has been the economy of reference for the free world. Not necessarily the best, not nec
    |ssarily the biggest, but roughly comparable to Europe or Asia in terms of total economic activity, except under a single fe
    |eral government and social system. ////- the American financial and economic system was not only continental in size and sc
    |le, it as also the most scrutinized, transparent, and reported-on large monetary system in the world. ////For this and a lo
    | of other reasons, debt issued by the US gov't became the new global "gold standard". Particularly during the cold war, Ame
    |ican prices, output, and economic stability was the best and most stable economic reference in the global economy. From rou
    |hly WWI to fairly recently, the safest, surest, and most predictable way to get your money back was to bet on the stability
    |and growth of the USA. ////For a long time now, the USA has been the economic "heat sink" of the world: consuming when pric
    |s are low, producing when prices are high, lending when interest rates climb, borrowing when they sink... America's large a
    |d mostly unregulated marketplace acts as a kind of shock-absorber to the global economy. But more to the point, American-is
    |ued debt is, in modern history, the most valuable commodity in the world, in terms of predictability of output value. ////A
    |pure and outright "default" or American "bankruptcy" is almost inconceivable. You might be looking at return-to-the-stone-a
    |e type stuff, worldwide. On the more realistic side of the spectrum, USA deficit  hawks could potentially force the USA int
    | a partial, temporary, or conditional shift. ////The reason why USA political and economic decisions matter in Europe is th
    |t the USA is roughly the size of Europe, and that usually makes the American federal government vastly more important than 
    |ny individual gov't in Europe. 


    |It's so fucked up that we here could suffer consequences for political action when we  have no vote or say in the matter.

    |Nothing.  The USA will not default unless Obama instructs the treasury to stop paying the bills.  We have more than enough 
    |ax revenue to pay our ongoing debt obligations as normal.  We do not need to borrow money to pay what we already owe, and a
    |yone who says otherwise is an idiot.


        |Correct, it really does bug me to hear this "US default" over and over in the media. Karl Denninger did a great post ea
        |lier this week (which you can't view now because of his 3 day boycott) and it basically boils down to: monthly tax inco
        |e is 10x the current monthly debt OBLIGATION, which Karl points out is different than the "political promises" that the
        |government spends money on, but in theory could just stop paying and not default.////It's also important to note that i

    |Basically, there is nothing to worry about for anyone unless the impasse regarding the debt ceiling is protracted beyond ar
    |und the 22nd of October, the date that the US Treasury is expected to run out of money. In any case, some serious misconcep
    |ions need to be cleared up here:////The word "default" is not really the right word to use. The US will never, ever default
    | The dollar is the reserve currency and the US has a ready and willing central bank to expand the money supply to cover any
    |debts. Default, under any future debt load, is impossible.////What markets are really worried about is a delay in interest 
    |nd principal payments on treasury securities. While these delays would have no impact whatsoever on any typical citizen of 
    |he world, they would have enormous potential impact on the financial markets. By "financial markets" I mean the system by w
    |ich funds move around from financial institution to financial institution. The primary way institutions transfer money to e
    |ch other is by lending against short-term treasury securities as collateral (the same way homeowners can take out a line of
    |credit against the value of their home). When investors become suspicious of having a missed payment on a treasury, they se
    |l them. This causes the price of the security to fall. If institutions have borrowed against treasuries (this is called a "
    |epo") then the value of their collateral has fallen. This makes institutions wary of lending to one another and inhibits fi
    |ancial lubrication, which is the speed at which money flows around the economy. ////Basically, when institutions stop trans
    |erring money around, things get pretty grim. This is what happened in the financial crisis and also in the debt ceiling deb
    |te of 2011. We are starting to see signs of jittery interbank lending now via increased repo rates (i.e., banks are chargin
    | more money to lend to one another since short term pledged US treasury collateral has fallen in value). However, the stock
    |market and the "real world" have yet to respond. This makes some sense because businesses are not so reliant on very short 
    |erm funding, but it is a worrisome sign nonetheless.////In short, I'm not so sure that folks in Eurpoe or the rest of the w
    |rld should be so worried about a delayed payment on Treasury bills, as it really isn't too big of a deal as long as the gri
    |lock is relatively short. I'm not really in a position to make predictions, but I'll bet that the dipshits in congress will
    |end the charade in the moments before we reach the debt ceiling.////TL;DR: The US will never default, only delay. The threa
    | of delay isn't too big of a deal so long as it gets resolved relatively quickly.////Source: work in a hedge fund


        |If you don't pay the interest or principal on a security or loan, you are in default.  Saying that it's not really a de
        |ault if it's just "delayed" is redefining the term.  I mean, I plan to get around to paying my mortgage one of these da
        |s so I'm not really in default, right?


            |Good point. It would be more accurate to call it a default with a 100% recovery rate plus interest (this happened t
            | the US before by the way...payments were delayed and repaid with interest when the treasury switched over to elect
            |onic transactions and encountered some glitches). I think in general parlance the term "default" means "insolvent,"
            |so I wanted to make clear that there is no danger of non-payment. 


        |I love these guys that are like "just print more money!"


    |The 14th amendment enforces debt payments before all outlays. Fed revenues are around $250 Billion a month. Debt outlays $2
    | Billion. The only default will be the gravy train that reckless extremists support.


        |That's one interpretation, and one that has never been tested.  Why would debt incurred through bond obligations to for
        |ign investors take priority over debt incurred through legislative obligations domestically?////Not that I think we are
        |at any risk of a default.  When push comes to shove, the people with money on the line will make sure this never comes 
        |o pass.


    |All the United States government has to do to not default is pay the interest on its debt. The interest this year is some w
    |ere around 400 billion, the United States takes in at least 6 times that in tax revenue. If interest rates spiral out of co
    |trol, we won't be able to borrow (at least not reasonably), but we wouldn't default, we would be forced to raise taxes and 
    |ut spending, primarily to defense, social security, and Medicare/Medicaid. The older you are and the poorer you are, the wo
    |se you would feel the effects. The debt sealing is just to finance deficit spending, which is only 1 trillion of the 3.8 tr
    |llion we spent in 2012. Right now interest rates are near 0%, but if they hit 7%, or 19% like they did in the 80's, deficit
    |spending at our current rate would be suicide.


        |&gt; we would be forced to raise taxes and cut spending////Or print money.////However, the point is that a default coul
        | be forced not because the US can't pay due to lack of money, but because an unresolved debt ceiling prevents any payme
        |ts. That is most certainly not going to happen, but it is a theoretical possibility.


    |Govt shutdown =/= a possibility of default.//////There is ABSOLUTELY no chance of the United States Defaulting on our debts
    | This is a *budget* crisis more than a *financial* crisis; the money is there.


        |This has nothing to do with the shutdown. This is from the government hitting the debt ceiling (which would've happened
        |in May without some creative accounting).


            |Even then a default isn't necessary.  Just a major federal cut.


                |Which would have to be agreed upon, so if everyone continues bickering and not talking to each other, it could 
                |appen. (Though it won't, they already either started talks about an extension or actually agreed on it.)


        |The USG *will* default on its debts sooner or later. Later and it'll be even more calamitous.


            |Not as long as it is using a fiat system. The government can always print as much money as it needs to in order to 
            |over its obligations. It is impossibe for it to default. ////Printing more money can cause inflation, but since the
            |US dollar is a reserve currency and is in high demand that isn't likely to happen. ////Printing more of it like we 
            |ave been doing during the recession isn't causing inflation now because foreign governments are gobbling up as much
            |as we can print. That's why, despite ballooning debt, interest rates are still low. ////Could it change? Sure. But 
            |t isn't as bad as politicians and media make it out to be.

                    |erve currency, and its value is driven probably more by supply and demand than it is the amount in circulat
                    |on. Much of it is held in foreign banks because it is seen as safer than local securities. As long as it is
                    |in high demand it will be valuable. ////&gt; Huh? They make it out like we've recovered from 2009.////It de
                    |ends on what area of the economy you look at. What I was talking about is risk of default on government obl
                    |gations. No matter what the politicians and the media say, not raising the debt limit will not cause an acr
                    |ss the board default of government obligations. ////We do need a spending bill to authorize the government 
                    |o resume spending at previous levels, but that's a different matter. 


            |No.


                |Yes. Debts would be paid off as money comes in. At some point the interest on the debt would exceed the revenue
                |that came in for that day, and payments would not be made. It's an inevitable course of events. You can't just 
                |ut your fingers in your ears and wish it away.


                    |The US government can print as much money as it needs to print in order to pay its debt. US government debt
                    |is guaranteed only in US currency, which can be created when the government needs it. Its ability to spend 
                    |s not tied to either revenue or debt. 


                        |Shall we print money to keep the rest of the government functioning? Or simply fall into third-world st
                        |tus and spend everything on interest payments? 


                            |We should print more money and issue debt, where necessary. The government can also increase taxes.
                            |///None of those things will result in the US becoming a third world country. That is hyperbole. 


                                |So we should print $3.5 trillion dollars per year to keep the government running? What effect d

                                    |I never said that. We don't need to do that to keep the government running, but it would wo
                                    |k. The government could spend less, reducing the pressure to borrow so much. Or it could is

    |Is the US saying it will never pay interest on the bonds? I think the US is saying the bond inerest will not be paid until

    |t is not a renoucing of the debt and will not have the very real and serious effects that national bankruptcy would have.

        |We had a close one this year though before the RCMP found the stolen syrup.


    |I'm no economist, but I've learned quite a bit over the past few years about economics and monetary theory. The thing I'm w
    |ndering is, if the Fed can print endless amounts of money, would it really matter if we default? We could just pay our bill
    | with the newly printed money. Sure, it would further destroy the value of the dollar, but it's already been devalued by 98
    |. How much more worthless could it get? This entire situation was not "caused" by the GOP, it happened a long time ago when
    |the US thought it could spend as much as it wanted because the dollar was delinked from gold. But how often do you hear abo
    |t that in the mainstream media?


        |Printing money doesn't fix anything unfortunately :/ all it'd do is lower mortgage percentages and raise inflation

        |yes we will


    |Lets just stop playing this whole game. It's stupid. 


    |Disaster.//Economic calamity.//Lehman times 100.////But, don't worry about it. Not going to happen. That would be equivalen
    | to the US Congress taking a shotgun and firing it into the brain of the US economy. Not even they can be so stupid. ////Wh
    |t is happening is politicians are using the THREAT of the debt ceiling to get what they want. Like, "give me everything in 
    |he vault, or I'm blowing up the bank!". And thus, everyone in the bank is kind of scared. But, in reality, said crazyperson
    |isn't going to blow up the bank, he's just using the threat to extort money. So relax.


    |So, if various conservative groups in the US believe in less government regulation, less taxes, smaller government, etc. wh
    |t incentive do they have not to just take their ball and go home?////It's unconstitutional for the US to default on debt, a
    |d it's possible to pay it off while making massive cuts to federal programs, which would be the perfect endgame for conserv
    |tives. Smaller government, no external damage, sure they lost some pork but they've lowered spending drastically across the
    |board. Why would they even want to negotiate?


    |1.) Anyone that collects income from US debt will have less income for the period of the default. If they have adequate cas
    | on hand, they may be able to absorb the blip without much drama. If they don't, then they themselves may be forced to eith
    |r sell something they ordinarily wouldn't, borrow from someone, or default on payments to people they owe themselves. Obvio
    |sly that wouldn't be great for them, and in the case of governments holding US debt, they may need to cut some services or 
    |aise some additional tax revenues to balance accounts. Any US debt holders that are backed into a corner economically speak
    |ng would have to default, and so there is some possibility for a domino effect.////2.) There will be a general lowering of 
    |onfidence in US debt as a risk free place to park money. How much is hard to say, but it's only reasonable that debt buyers
    |would re-balance their exposures. As I understand it, UK and Japanese debt are the two closest alternatives, so they may se
    | an increase in demand for their debt, allowing them more favorable terms. They both are also US debt holders (Japan enormo
    |sly so), so if they have to sell more debt to make up for a short term lack of US payments this shift in confidence could h
    |lp them weather it better than other large US debt holders (eg China).////3.) There are lots of likely secondary effects (U
    | dollar loses some value for example) but I don't know enough to feel confident listing or predicting those.////Suffice it 
    |o say, none of these effects are good for the world as a whole. It's hard to know exactly how severe these effects are with
    |ut knowing the relevant numbers and calculating the financial positions of US debt holders, and if I could do that accurate
    |y I'd probably work on Wall street :P.


        |stopped reading at "may have to borrow". What part of default do you not understand?


            |Nothing. That the US defaults does not mean US debt holders will forced into borrowing to cover the US's failure to
            |pay as agreed. They may have other more preferable means available. It depends on the details of their own future c
            |mmitments and assets. Next time you feel the need to be pointlessly and mistakenly critical at least read.

    |The US will not go into default.////Even if we hit the debt cap, we have far more than enough income to cover debt service.
    |///The only way we would default is if Obama decided to intentionally screw over the US and world economies by not paying t
    |e interest on the debt. I'm not a fan of his, but there is no way he is going to make that decision.


        |It's not Obama's choice to pay the debt or not, it's under the purview of Congress.


            |I'm sick and tired of people blaming the faults of a country on it's leader.////Sure, they make executive decisions
            |here and there...but all that's heavily influenced by others as well.////The designation of 'President' seems to be
            |more 'scapegoat'

                |orks? Dirty Politicians!


                |The leader is supposed to take responsibility and lead, regardless of who makes the mess. Obama gets a lot of b
                |ame because Obama gives a lot of blame instead of leading. 


                    |But Congress is in control of the purse strings not Obama. And to base the shutdown on Obamacare was terrib
                    |e strategy by the Republicans, it would never work.


                        |Congress appropriates money through spending bills, either via budget bills or appropriations bills. Th
                        | president must sign those bills before money can be spent. He can veto those bills.////His hands are n
                        |t clean when it comes to government spending. ////Basing the shutdown on Obamacare was stupid. I agree.
                        |It is legal and affirmed by the Supreme Court. 


        |I doubt it was intentional, but you hit the "Thanks Obama" note with that reply. It'd be the Legislative branch, not th
        | executive that screwed everyone in the scenario you described bar the unlikely chance that Obama veto'd the bills requ
        |red to stop it.  


        |Let me get this straight, the US has enough income to pay off its debt, but chooses not to.


            |No, it has enough income to service the debt. That is, pay interest.////It does not have enough to pay it off.


            |This is something that only is confusing if you think of money like a normal paycheck to paycheck citizen.  Global 
            |conomics are not something you can equate to this.  Having no debt isn't a good thing, and having a run away debt i
            |n't a good thing.  Its complicated, but the first step is to throw away the way you think about money as someone wh
            | uses it for groceries.////*edit note*; not at all meant to be condescending or rude... thinking of money like this
            |is like thinking of gravity on the scale of galaxies... it's simply not something we have a reference for in our da
            |ly lives.  It's not intuitive.  And no matter what the talking heads try to program into people, it's not simple.


                |Wait, how is having no debt a bad thing?


                    |Lets say you can borrow money at 0.25% interest (which the government can). Further, lets assume you have e
                    |ough money coming in to pay off that loan. Sure, you could pay it off, but it wouldn't be a very good use o
                    | your money. Instead, you should invest the money you would have spent paying off the loan in something tha
                    | earns more than a 0.25% return (which is to say, pretty much anything).////For example, if I borrow $1000 
                    |t 0.25% interest, I have to pay $2.50 per year in interest. Now, if I take the $1000 I would have spent pay
                    |ng off the $1000 loan principle and invest it in a fund that pays a guaranteed 2% interest (a GIC, for exam
                    |le), I will be earning $20 per year in investment income. $20.00 - $2.50 = $17.50. Therefore, I'm *making* 
                    |17.50 per year by *not* paying back the loan.


                        |I see.////That makes sense. Thanks.


                    |In a roundabout way, having debt marks you as a player in world economics, if nobody invests in you (and he
                    |ce is owed eventual money by you) you're not significant. ////


                        |&gt;if nobody invests in you (and hence is owed eventual money by you)////If nobody invests in me, then
                        |nobody would ever be owed eventual money by me.


                            |True, but in this scenario, you wouldn't have the cash in the mean time to grow a business (or econ
                            |my). Think of it like financing a startup. In many cases, it will simply not be viable to organical
                            |y grow a business or finance it out of pocket. Loans have to be taken to secure a store front, merc
                            |, and pay employees, but once the business is going you can pay all of that, the loans, and then ne
                            | a proffit. Without the loan, you would not of just had less proffit; you would of had none. A coun
                            |ry would be a much larger/more complex version of the same type of thing. It would be nice to not e
                            |er owe anyone anything, but having infrastructure like roads can lead to further economic developme
                            |t that will pay off quickly.


                    |Many reasons.  No treasury bonds for one, which is an issue for large scale finance.  Also basic inflation 
                    |eans that a dollar spent today is worth more than a dollar spent tomorrow.  So using dollars from tomorrow 
                    |o pay for things today saves money.////The trick here, and this should really be noted before anyone scream
                    | a reply, is ***moderation***.  Run away debt is an issue and should be controlled, but paying off the debt
                    |screws with the system as well.


                    |Debt can be thought of like a cold spot in a thermal system, or a charge potential in a circuit. You need t

                    |these things, then going into debt is a good thing. And if in the long run, you expect that this car or hou

    |The truth is there's almost no reason for the US to default unless it chooses to do so. This is because the relationship be

    |aise more money to then pay these back, or they can default. The US government (or any government issuing bonds in its own
