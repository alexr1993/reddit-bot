Today I learned that when the President is unmarried or his wife dies during his term, another female relative will become the First Lady. Three president's daughters, two president's sisters, two nieces and two daughters-in-law have been First Lady.(/r/Today I Learned (TIL))




    |The real question is: who will be First Lady if Hilary wins in 2016?


        |Bill will be the first First Lord.


            |First Dude


                |Addressing congress//// *shrugging, arms raised* "The First Dude abides."

                        |That amendment really tied the constitution together


                            |This isn't congress, there are rules!


                |Far out.


                |Actually it's First Gentleman lol


                    |*Fist Gentleman


                |Donny you're out of your element! 


                    |What the fuck is he talking about, Dude?


                    |You said it, man. 


                |First Bro.

                    |Monica handled it fairly well.


                        |Clearly not, she went around blabbing about it for years to come.

            |The First Lad. 


            |The male of First Lady is First Gentleman, not "first lord". 


                |I dunno, first lord kinda sounds better.


                    |sounds a bit ominous though... I like it


                        |Sounds like something from Star Wars.//"All rise for the honorable First Lord Clinton."

                            |Let's be honest, there's probably an extra 'r' in that title. 


                                |Wat?

                    |Sounds way too European.

                |Maybe someone can explain to me why/how the word "gentleman" came about to take over the word "lord," because h
                |storically/royally, the gender counterpart of "lady" has always been "lord." It wasn't until the 1600s that you
                |notice the word "gentleman" start being used more.////[... some internetting being done at this time...]////Oka
                |, according to [some guy](http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=2039272):////"Lords and gentlemen are
                |different: lords were hereditary members of the House of Lords, and gentlemen were commoners. 'Lady' as a title
                |is strictly the wife of a lord or a knight, but is also used as a polite term for a commoner's wife, as in 'lad
                |es and gentlemen.' Lords rank first. If the King was present, he would have to say, 'Your Majesty, my lords' an
                | so on."////I will take this as fact. Also, considering that the husband of a president would not be considered
                |a "commoner," in my humble opinion, "First Lord" would be more appropriate than "First Gentleman." Let it be do


                    |Actually, in the United States, there is no nobility, thus everyone is a 'commoner.' Therefore, the term "F
                    |rst Lady" is actually the misnomer, as she is not married to a lord, and has never been married to a lord d

                    |riate. 


                    |The idea behind of the most democracies is that elected officials remain commoners.


                    |"Gentlemen" originally referred to a male member of the "gentry", which was a social class unique in Europe
                    |to the British Isles. It referred to the minor nobility, coming from the French *gentil*, or high born. It 
                    |eferred to the landowners without formal titles.  In places like Austria and France, it was nearly impossib
                    |e to cross from the commoner class into the aristocratic class, but in Britain, it provided a bridge, by wh
                    |ch a wealthy merchant could buy up land in the country and be taken seriously by the elite. From there, one
                    |could lobby for a title and become a member of the full aristocracy. This class was thus instrumental in th
                    | development of British (and thus American) social and political development. In continental Europe, the ar
                    |tocracy dependended on the monarch for their power, and thus backed the absolutist monarchies that develope
                    |. In Britain, this large class of people in the elite, who got there through independent means, had a stron
                    | enough stake in the system that they could force concessions and limits on the monarch, and constitutional
                    |sm as a system was born.


                    |It's worth noting that the stem of "gentleman" ("gentle") actually comes from the word "gentry". You can se
                    | the gentry as either one of two things: As A) the highest level of status an individual can reach without 
                    |eing a member of the nobility or B) the lowest members of the nobility, for instance the nobility with titl
                    |s like Duke Warwick or Lord Somerset, ect were members of the nobilitas major and land owners like the Kett
                    |brothers who were most definitely members of the gentry could be considered to be members of the nobilitas 
                    |inor. ////So anyway, "First Lord" would be a term which is reserved explicitly for a member of the nobility
                    | which is a class which has been vacant in the USA since the 18th century. The term "lady" or "first lady" 
                    |oes not *necessarily* have a link with the nobility major! A lady, these days, is simply a woman who has ac
                    |ieved some status. Often the term lady can be given to any married women, irrespective of what anyone think
                    | of her status or class. ////So////Lady = non-nobilty ////Lord = definitely member of the nobility////Gentl
                    |man = member of the gentry////The [House of Lords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords) is obviousl
                    | very relevant here also and I do recommend reading about it if you're interested.

            |Yes, President (as well as Governor) is a title that the office-holder is entitled to for life. So technically, if

            |ply President and President Clinton (in comparison to, say, President and Mrs. Obama). Hillary would always be refe

                |I think it would be Presidents Clinton.  ////Also, from the article, it looks like Chelsea has already been Fir

                |sigh... ICQ... good times....


        |Because, Romans. The Princeps (cf. Principe, Prince) in Roman history was literally the "First Man". By the time of the
        |Middle Ages, his wife, his counterpart, was known as the Principissa (Princess), the "First Lady". ////The United State
        | of America is a self-proclaimed successor to the Roman Republic/Empire. Hell, our President is known as the "Supreme C
        |mmander", or in Latin, Imperator. Can you guess which English word comes from Imperator?


            |Imp?


            |Imperative?


                |Impero, Imperare etc. Is a Latin verb!!


            |Emperor!


            |I'd say self-proclaimed successor to the Republic, since the Founders all identified with Cincinnatus, Cassius, Bru
            |us, etc. And they used the Republic's system of checks and balances as a model for our's. Although today we are the
            |de facto successor to the Empire as well.


                |It's amazing how obvious this effort is in the architecture of DC.  It's like they drew plans based on the conc
                |pt, "Let's be Rome, bitches!"


            |Well, *tell us already*!


            |Emperor.

            |Impersonator!


    |&gt;The Office of the First Lady of the United States is accountable to the First Lady for her to carry out her duties as h
    |stess of the White House, and is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House. The First Lady has 
    |er own staff that includes a chief of staff, press secretary, White House Social Secretary, Chief Floral Designer, etc. The
    |Office of the First Lady is an entity of the White House Office, a branch of the Executive Office of the President.[8] **As
    |such, Hillary Clinton's abdication of the office in favor of the couple's daughter, in advance of the former's installation
    |as a United States Senator, avoided conflict under the Ineligibility Clause of the United States Constitution.**////Can som
    |one explain this part to me?  I'm having difficulty understanding.//


        |Since the office of first lady is classified as a part of the executive branch, a first lady serving as a senator would
        |violate the separation of powers in the Constitution.////


        |&gt;  Can someone explain this part to me? I'm having difficulty understanding.////Nobody is allowed under to US consti
        |ution to hold an office in both the legislative and executive branches simultaneously. Cant be a Senator if you're the 
        |irst Lady, because the latter is considered a part of the executive, no matter how secondary the role.////


            |Nobody except the Vice President, who has the one job of casting the deciding vote in the Senate in the event of a 
            |0/50 split. 


                |Well, they can also preside over the Senate more generally, make parliamentary decisions, etc. The Senate gener
                |lly grants the VP little power, but in theory they could have as much or more as the Speaker of the House--deci
                |ing committee assignments, which bills get voted on when, rules and procedures, etc.


        |Hillary was running for Congress, which is part of the legislative branch of the federal government.  The Office of the
        |First Lady is a part of the executive branch.  According to the Ineligibility Clause, you can't be in office in both th
        | executive branch and the legislative branch at the same time.  So from Jan 3, 2000, when new Senators and Representati
        |es take office, until Jan 20, 2000, when new Presidents take office, she would have had both jobs.  So she resigned fro
        | the executive job and allowed Chelsea Clinton to take the office instead.


        |From January 3, 2001 to January 20, 2001 Bill Clinton was President of the United States and Hillary Clinton was a U.S.
        |Senator from New York, at the same time. I believe during and just before that time Hillary Clinton abdicated the offic
        | of First Lady of the United States to her daughter. At least, that is the quotes claim, I have no idea if that's true.


        |My question is if the wife can refuse the position and pass it to someone else. For example if she already has a career
        |and no time for such things or perhaps lacks the necessary skills to be an adequate white house hostess. 


            |Someone else just mentioned when it did happen. Hillary Clinton passed it on to their daughter when she ran for Sen
            |te.


    |Does the First Lady have political duties? Is that why the position needs to be filled?


        |Sort of.  She is expected to handle official hospitality much of the time (kinda sexist, whatevs), and she has a lot of
        |moral-type authority and influence.  


            |Well, it's not really sexist since the role is not limited to women but is generally seen as the responsibility of 
            |he head of state or government's partner.////For example, when the G8 met in 2007 in Germany, Joachim Sauer, the ot
            |erwise very private husband of Angela Merkel, [played First Gentleman for the visiting Ladies.](http://commons.wiki
            |edia.org/wiki/File:Partnerprogramm_G8_2007.jpg) 


                |How many of the founders do you think could even imagine a man serving in that position?


            |Also, I'm not sure if it's required but it has become somewhat expected of the FLOTUS in recent years to use her ti
            |e in ways benefiting the country or the welfare of the citizens. Hillary was instrumental in Bill Clinton's health 
            |are efforts, Laura Bush focused very heavily on education and women's health while Michelle Obama's pet project has

        |The first lady's duties are really up to her choosing. Some take on a social role in general White House and Presidenti

    |I wonder what would happen if/when America has an openly gay president? Could a gay male president's partner be considered

        |Same thing as if America had a female president - the guy would be 'First Gentleman'.


            |I have wondered both of these.


            |We'll find out in 2016 when Hillary destroys whatever stodgy old white man the Republicans put up.

                |That's a lot of bravado. People are very unsure of Obama right now, and as a rule the whole Democrat party. The
                |next election could very well go to a Republican. Not that I hope it does, but I feel it's a bigger possibility
                | 


                    |The GOP isn't going to gain any ground until they reform their social policies on a broader level. Too many

                        |Nah, people for the president with their wallets, not their social conscience. Bush was elected (twice!

                |LOL, the last thing this country needs are her feminist policies.


                    |Yeah, because fuck equality for women!


                        |Feminism is not equality...


                            |Feminism is entirely about redressing inequality. Does that mean that they focus on women to the ex
                            |lusion of men? Yes. *Because of the inequality*. What part of this is hard to grasp?


                                |Maybe we aren't experiencing the same situations. Feminism is about swinging the pendulum past 
                                |quality towards pro-woman at the expense of men. When I read articles that a man should walk on
                                |the other side of the street at night so a woman can feel safe walking I cringe and wonder what

        |I'd like to see what would happen if and when a First Lady came out as trans. I think it would force a lot of people to
        |finally read up on the definition.


        |There are past presidents that had a niece or someone else step in that are speculated to have been gay such as Buchana
        |. No proof though.


            |It was fairly well accepted at the time with Buchanan. Some people also suspect Lincoln, but in his case it was mor
            | than likely a romantic friendship since they were fairly common at the time. 


            |That's completely different than a gay person with a same-sex spouse, though. Plus, it's not like the role of Presi
            |ent's Spouse has to be gendered anymore. 


        |Huge redneck attack.


    |TIL that "First Lady" wasn't just a synonym for "president's wife"


    |For some reason its really sweet to think of your daughter being the first lady if you're the president. 


    |Can a U.S history lover tell me if we have ever had an unmarried President?


        |Buchanan was also quite likely homosexual. Widely regarded as the worst president ever because he strictly adhered to t
        |e constitution. People blame him for things leading up to the Civil War since he didn't do a lot to appease either side
        |as states were seceding. While he agreed it was illegal for a state to secede, he also believed it was illegal to use m
        |litary force against them since you can't use the military as a police force within the US. 


        |James Buchannan


            |And *that* went well...

                |appened on his watch. 


        |James Buchanan


        |I know for a fact There's been at least two. I'm too lazy to Google it.


        |Tom Cruise


    |I thought First Lady was a title given to the chief hostess of the White House. Meaning technically if The Presidents wife 
    |hose to pursue a career instead then they could name someone else First Lady.


    |In Australia, we just had a female prime minister and her partner was called First Bloke. 


    |The current president of Korea was the first lady when she was young after her mother was assassinated. 


    |Wow, I majored political science in college, spent entire semesters learning about shit like that and literally read it for
    |fun but that thought never before crossed my mind.////I guess I just never thought it was a real role that a Presidential W
    |fe filled because of a need, I assumed it came out of a need to create for a role for the Presidential wife. As in, if ther
    | were no wife of the president, I just always assumed there would be no first lady and nothing would have changed. The thou
    |ht of 'welp, just put in whoever is next in the batters box' seems silly in that case.


    |What happens if there is no female relative?


    |I still have no idea who my country's first lady is. The pimping president has too many wives.


        |Me neither with our prime minister. I wish he had a partner, though, as it would be a great statement for gay rights wo
        |ldwide.


    |The second lady?


    |&gt;Today I learned that when the President is unmarried or his wife dies during his term, another female relative will bec
    |me the First Lady. Three president's daughters, two president's sisters, two nieces and two daughters-in-law have been Firs
    | Lady.////That's hawt.


    |That's silly. Why does there need to be a first lady? This almost seems like some strange royalty type shit.


        |They play the role of hostess for the White House I believe.


    |TIL being the first lady is even less of an achievement than previously thought. 


    |I'd love for an unmarried president to settle the issue of who First Lady is by saying "We've got work to do. Cut the crap.


    |So I suppose the follow up question is, what then if the President has no living female relatives?


        |Just like the Royal family of England, there will always be a female relative.


            |Not that the Windsors would commit female relatives they didn't like to psych wards for life without ever visiting 
            |hem, oh no.


            |And her name will be **King Ralph.**


                |I don't know how to play cricket, and I would still whale on that ball so hard. Just for the sake of that movie


        |I'm guessing that he'd ask a lady friend to do it.


            |But what if he's a redditor?


                |The First Cat. ////Hopefully Tardy, aka Grumpy cat.


                    |hasn't the animal suffered enough?


                |OAG ---&gt;  OAFL


    |Please say US President so the uniformed know!


        |This is reddit: when in doubt, assume US.


            |When explicitly stated otherwise, assume US


        |Americans are self-centered.  They refer to the position as "the President"////Other nations feel the need to specify, 
        |.e. "The Canadian Prime Minister".


            |Yes, the earth actually does revolve around me.


            |Yeah Americans are like that, they're like teenage girls in a way. They think everything revolves around them.


            |They are self-centred, but only in as much as they perceive reddit as a US forum. Canadians in a domestic context w
            |uld refer to "The Prime Minister", the same way we in New Zealand do. 


    |Why bother? Nobody elects the 'first lady' no matter who she is. It just looks like a hangover from monarchies. Kinda sexis
    |. (I'm not American)


        |Sexist how? Please, we're all terribly interested.


            |I think OP is suggesting it's kind of sexist because first ladies are treated like children when you compare their 
            |ole to their male counterparts. Redecorating the white house, leading a campaign against bullying or childhood obes
            |ty. These are the kinds of jobs given to first ladies because, they almost give the illusion that the first lady is
            |a valuable asset outside of her ability to provide companionship for a world leader. 


                |They weren't elected. It would be a little alarming if they did anything else.//


        |How is it sexist? Behind every man who fumbled his way into success is a fantastic lady keeping him together. ////Sourc
        |: am a fantastic lady. 


    |is that some kind of faux royal pageantry to appease the peasants?


    |Where in the article does it say that three president's daughters, two president's sisters, two nieces, and two daughters-i
    |-law have been First Lady?


    |False. Canada has no president.//


    |South Korea's current president Park Geun Hye, previously held the title of first lady after her mother was assassinated.//
    |/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Geun-hye#Early_life_and_education


    |That anchored weird, it's actually in the second section. TIL indeed, though.


    |Why does the title of 1st lady even exist? 


    |Bill Clinton thought about this very situation every day of his presidency.


    |Great title!!


    |Never thought about that. Thanks for the intel. 


    |could someone explain the significance of the first lady?


    |So how about let's have it the other way.  When Jack Kennedy got his head split in Dallas, why not have Bobby move into the
    |Oval Office?  Heck, at least he may still be alive with a better security detail.  And just think of those three-ways with 
    |ackie and that saucy tom-boy Ethel.


    |So what if the president just chose some whore to be his wife, would she be first lady?


    |Not the US but, the president of the Philippines doesn't have a wife.


    |I see a movie coming. 


    |Yeah, unmarried (&amp; possibly atheist), that'll happen.


    |What is this picture of the First Lady implying too ? Is OP saying someone will attempt to take the First lady's life ? 


    |Damn, finally a TIL that really gave me new info. Someone buy Scaurus beer from the rest of us. Cheers!


    |Next time, please specify in your title, which country you were thinking of. I had to click and see that it was about the U
    |A.


    |From Wikipedia: //&gt;  The Office of the First Lady is an entity of the White House Office, a branch of the Executive Offi
