    |I'm not sure if I'm completely wrong but at such an age due to normal environmental impact and aging you have a higher chance of develo

    |mulation of mutations that affect cellular growth rates and their respective containment mechanisms overall end up interfering with nor

        |&gt;The Japanese will do anything for their own////Except that they now openly discriminate against people from Fukushima. They are
        |not allowed to some hotels for example. ////These old Japanese are the remains of old Japan. There is increasing number of elderly 
        |uicides when younger generation neglects them. Some are depressed, some kill themselves just not to be the burden.

    |if prayers actually did anything, I would totally pray for these people

        |Unfortunately prayer does do something, or rather the knowledge that prayer is being performed for you, increases your chances of d
        |ing.////The religious nut-jobs have made any religious search on google pointless, so I can't find the reference. It has been refer
        |nced in Dawkins "The God Delusion". The specific experiment was performed on patients who had just received a double bypass, so the
        | already had a non-trivial chance of dying.

    |Can we get an actual article instead of a picture? Please? 

        |ID: c278bhk, Author: aequanimita
        |Right!  I want to upvote, but I can't support this behavior.

        |No, this is reddit.

        |Because it's obvious karma whoring.  He could have posted a link to an actual article, but instead made a picture because he knew t
        |at's what the hivemind here likes.  Here is a link to this same topic, from the front page, over a month ago:////http://www.reddit.

    |This is very noble, but his logic is flawed. Old people are already at higher risk for cancer, and any exposure to radiation is going t
    | increase that risk, even in the short-term. The cancer taking 20-30 years to develop is just an average figure among people of average
    |age.////It's one thing to say that you're okay with sacrificing yourself because you're old and you're going to die soon anyway, but it
    |doesn't make any sense to say that you'll do it because you'll probably die of something else before the cancer hits. You're already fa
    |rly likely to die from cancer within the next few years, and the radiation isn't going to help matters.

        |He can also expect to live on for more than 13 to 15 years. The average age of 85 includes a lot of people who died young, if you h
        |ve already made it to 70 your average life expectancy will be higher.

    |This is called sacrifice. It is truly incredible that any individual would be willing to give up so much for a future that they will mo

        |They are old. They will almost surely die from causes unrelated to any exposure to radiation they could experience from dealing wit
        | nuclear power plant failure now or in the future.////Nevertheless, it's truly a sacrifice for people of their age to volunteer to 
        |o work that will probably entail some hard physical labor when they could be hanging out playing video games or reading Reddit.

    |Your missing the point. He said he doesn't need to make the ultimate sacrifice.

    |what's sad is that here in the US, none of the baby boomers would even consider doing this.   

    |ID: c277xvk, Author: terath
    |The west's *me generation* would never do this. Our culture is based on selfishness on all levels. ////What does that social program do
    |for me? What does the space shuttle do for me? I don't need that medical care so why should I pay for others? China is fucking up the e
    |vironment so why should I change my lifestyle to help the environment? ////Fuck humanity give me a hummer.

    |Wow. Somehow I don't see American old people doing this kind of thing (even physically able ones).////While we commend this guy's human
    |ty, I would also point out how logical he is; Americans just don't think like this. This also reminds me of SPOILER Spock's death scene
