        |I think that constantly talking on the phone will prove to be the best way of keeping fit.

    |I often climb things. Nothing outrageous, but suddenly I'll realize I'm standing on a stool or something.

        |I found myself walking on coffee tables and the sofa like a child playing "the floor is lava" while on a longer call once...

        |ID: c782uym, Author: Prisoner-655321
        |I pace while on the phone. I can't make eye contact for longer than a few seconds when talking in person and I also get uncomfortab
        |e and try to flee the scene ASAP, usually awkwardly and prematurely.. 

        |ID: c7850gv, Author: clintonjh88
        |For me, I feel I am pacing because if I were talking to a person face to face, I'd be using hand movements, so walking/pacing is me
        |releasing that feeling of hand movement

        |ID: c78fopz, Author: GnarlsDarwin
        |I walk around, but also subconsciously grab my balls when I'm anxious about the call.  One day I was tripping fairly hard on mushro
        |ms by myself at home (mistake), and the landline phone rang and I answered it (mistake), and it was my grandmother.  I was basicall
        | jogging around my house clenching my nuts trying to keep up with my grandmother's conversation.////

        |ID: c782fz7, Author: jason_steakums
        |I usually find myself standing on the bed or the couch at some point in the conversation.

        |I do this at work. Open random files on the PC, start doing some filing, a bit of shredding, go for a walk around other rooms. By t
        |e time I've hung up I'm completely confused as to what I was doing.

    |is there any explanation why people do this?

        |ID: c781f3x, Author: that_dude_you_know
        |I once read an explanation that I can no longer find. It said that when you are talking on the phone you are missing out on half of
        |the conversation: the body language. Without being able to read the other person's body language &amp; facial expressions, you subc
        |nsciously become tense/stressed and so you pace!

        |ID: c783tid, Author: kinologik
        |ADD... Moving around "occupies" the brain and minimizes "thought overlapses". This helps to keep focused on the ongoing conversatio
        | and facilitates a "fluid" stream of consciousness (instead of 3 or 4 battling ideas at the same time, in which case you stop liste
        |ing to your interlocutor and just try to make sense of your own thoughts).

        |ID: c78bm2t, Author: Cryingintheshower
        |You actually do this to give yourself confidence in the conversation. Because you have no other controle apart from the intonation 
        |f your voice. //Notice that if you're calm and the conversation is "relaxed" you don't move much.//Source: life

        |I volunteer at an occupational therapy center and walk/talk on my phone all the time. The therapist pointed it out to me and said I
        |likely have ADHD. Apparently, my phone conversations get pretty intense (I'm excited), and I need a way to put my energy elsewhere.
        |When I walk, it helps me get out that extra energy and I can stay focus. It's similar to fidgeting with a pencil or chewing gum. So
        |I wouldn't say I'm nervous on the phone, just energized (the psychological term here is aroused, but it's reddit, so I avoided sayi
        |g that).

    |In the military, it is actually a rule that you cant walk around while talking on the phone.

        |ID: c780fr4, Author: DELETED
        |Why is that?

        |ID: c781n97, Author: TwidgetUSN
        |I got my ass chewed for pacing back and forth in in a 5 foot line on the smoke deck while talking on the phone because I was "walki
        |g and talking". ////I was like, piss off petty officer! ////But what I really said was "aye aye, petty officer" and sat my ass down

        |ID: c780vbx, Author: claychastain
        |In reality, I don't think I've seen anyone really following that rule, though there's always a risk someone will start knife handin
        | you. But that could happen for pretty much any reason.

        |ID: c785j5b, Author: weDAMAGEwe
        |similar rule in a lot of nuclear plants, even outside of the plant in engineering or admin buildings and parking lots.  if you're o
        | the phone, you aren't watching where you're going, and that could lead to injuries.  i don't know if the military does it for the 
        |ame reason.

    |I do the same thing all the time and always have. From time to time someone I know will tell me I'm making them nervous by pacing aroun
    |. If I'm the phone while laying down, I automatically start grabbing nearest objects to me tossing them up in the air, and then catchin
    | them, when I miss, I just grab something else. However even though I'm paying enough attention to what I'm doing to make sure said obj
    |cts are unbreakable, in that zoned out state I seem to not care about how safe they are. Once tossing up a letter opener made to look l
    |ke a dagger, while laying on my back- almost took out an eye. My eye. //

    |I always do this. When I lived with my parents it used to drive them nuts ("STOP PACING" was a common yell from then while I was on the

    |Ok so I'm not the only one who does this? My family thinks I'm nuts. It usually happens involuntarily and I eventually realize that I h

    |I do that all the time. I just walk around my tiny apartment in small circles. Probably looks really weird but I don't even think about
    |it.

    |This is so very true. Back when phones had cords, I used to judge my next phone purchase on its cord length and comfort for wandering.

    |I've been told that it actually helps you pay attention to the person on the other line.

    |Quite often reddit astounds me with it's level of insight, and this OP, is just another one of those ocassions. 10/10.

    |My SO does this. It annoys the hell out of me. I will be watching a show and he will have already walked through the house and the only
    |place left to go is in front of the television and around the couches where his voice over powers anything the tube can produce.

    |Fuck that.  Nothing in the first world is worse than sitting, watching tv and having someone walk into the room talking to someone and 
    |ot listening to your pleas to leave so you can hear what's happening.

    |I'm the same way. Before I got a job, I had numerous phone interviews, all of which were done with me pacing around the house.

    |ID: c7838xa, Author: agentup
    |Yes a thousand times yes. When I'm on the phone I have to be walking around. I hate talking on the phone though. It is always awkward f
    |r me because my hearing isn't very good.

    |My ex gf used to get so flustered that I would walk around my house. I have taken it to the yard and several laps around the neighborho

    |In the olden days they called those contraptions walkie-talkies.

    |ID: c783eb0, Author: IronSloth
    |I do exactly this! Ill walk a mile in my own house and even run out of breath, panting over the phone.//

        |I was talking to a fabric awning guy today and he thought I was crying due to my asthmatic heavy phone breathing

    |I miss that - Verizon ensures I don't leave a small 3'x3' area in my kitchen unless I want my call dropped.

    |My family referred to my phone pacing as that of Uncle Scrooge pacing on his circular self made trail.

    |keep hands free and then try to draw the person on the other line while on the phone, places they are walking to

    |ID: c783lq2, Author: dirtyethel
    |i do it, too - in the house on cooler days, but i head out to the deck and pace back and forth on warm days. ////i work from home, so i
    | i'm talking to a client and don't need to reference papers in front of me, i'll do a bit of quiet housework while i'm talking to them,
    |too.////it gets me up and away from the computer for a few minutes, which is probably a good thing!

    |There's not even reception in 95% of my house, yet my roommate does this while shouting at whoever is on the other end. *facedesk*

    |I thought I was the only one doing this. hilarious.

    |I need to do that to get away from the kids. Every time I change rooms they end up following and GUYS I'M ON THE PHONE!

    |ID: c784e0k, Author: OB1_Shinobi
    |I find myself trying to walk in places that haven't seen traffic in a while so that I'm not making trails in my carpet. Then I forget w
    |at I'm talking about.  

    |ID: c784pvn, Author: CorgisaurusRex
    |I don't know why but I tend to put my hand in my pants without thinking about it while I'm on the phone... not even sexually or anythin
    |.
