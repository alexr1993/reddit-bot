|I run a cake business. I charge people hundreds for wedding cakes... Every last one is made using Pilsbury cake mix I buy for $1 a box at W
|lmart. //I suck at baking. Every time I've ever tried to make a cake from scratch it sucked. //But baking is like.. My whole deal. My frien
|s all call me the cake girl. It's like my whole life is a lie. //People compliment my cakes all the time. Telling me how delicious they are
| Telling me it's so much better than box mix cake. Telling me they could never bake a cake so delicious. //Well guess what? For $1, they to
| can make a cake just as delicious. Just add oil, eggs and water. //In my defense, I love cake decorating. I make all of the frostings and 
|ondant from scratch. I just hate baking fucking cakes!! I base my prices mostly on the decoration of the cakes and not of the cake itself o
| that makes sense. Still...//No one knows about this except my husband. Even my best friends think I fucking slave over the oven mixing and
|baking these damn cakes. I have been doing this for YEARS. //If anyone knew my business and reputation would be in the toilet for sure. ://
|I keep telling myself I have to learn how to make the damn cakes without the box mixes, but I never do it. I feel like such a sham sometime
|. //////Edit-holy shit I didn't expect such a response to this! I feel better about it thanks to a lot of these comments! ////Funny, I star
|ed this account as a novelty account and got bored of googling random cakes to post as comments lol//Seemed perfect for this confession!!!/
|////Edit 2: months later I receive messages almost daily on this account. I am so glad I used a throwaway. I forget to check this account m
|st of the time and rarely see this stuff until weeks later. ////That said, to answer the main questions- yes I know I can order cake mix on
|ine, but I don't make enough cakes for it to be economical. It's actually more expensive to order online. //Honestly, I'm not incredibly wo
|ried about people seeing me anymore. If I ran into someone I would tell them that I was helping my niece with a bake sale or something. ///
|I have, since this thread, made some cakes from scratch. I'm still using box mixes for chocolate and vanilla. Oh and red velvet because fuc
| all of that. ////Let's see what else, oh right, I've received probably 100 comments saying "The cake is a lie." We get it. It's very cleve
|, but no, I'm sorry, you're not the first, second, third or twentieth to say it. ////Overall, I've learned this is actually pretty normal. 
|nd that people from all over the world have a friend who makes cakes and they all think I am their friend. So far no one has pinned me, but
|you guys had better check your friend's cabinets for Pilsbury mix ;)

    |How does Walmart not notice you pushing a cart out with hundreds of boxes of $1 cake mix?

        |ID: c4izry6, Author: iGotYouThisCake
        |Haha well, I'm a home based business, so I usually at most am buying 10-20 boxes at a time. I usually line the bottom of the cart w
        |th cake mix and then put all my other stuff on top. Like 10 bags of powdered sugar... Then I use the self check out in shame and st
        |ck the boxes in my black canvas shopping bags. ////My worst fear is running into someone I know  (or worse yet, whoever the cake is
        |for) while I'm there with all these boxes of cake mix!! That's why I act all shady about it lol//

        |ID: c5pdc2a, Author: Nee-chan
        |we don't notice because we have no fucks to give as long as shits getting sold.

    |At least there was no incest in this one.

        |ID: c4j1d0c, Author: tugrumpler
        |Yeah, I'm upvoting everyone in this thread just because there's no incest, cum boxes, or shit-on friends. I needed a break, of cour
        |e I *could* stop reading, hahaha, right.. This thread is mesmerizing, like watching a car wreck in slo-mo.

        |Yea but I still masturbated to it...

        |ID: c4j2e0s, Author: waffleso_0
        |hahah.  thanks for making me laugh

        |ID: c5yho43, Author: Ilantzvi
        |I read this before I got to those incesty posts.  I had no idea...

        |ID: c635ctk, Author: BurtReynoldsMostache
        |How does it feel to have your highest comment be about incest?

        |ID: c59jj6x, Author: jake122212121
        |And the next one just haaaad to be an incest one.//////Edit: Next one I saw**

        |ID: c4mq1gu, Author: Wyvos12
        |Lol true

        |ID: c4jejca, Author: ras344
        |Man, the incest stories are the best ones.  

    |ID: c4j7jvm, Author: SDForce
    |The cake. It's a lie.

        |ID: c4jkyem, Author: DorfCakes
        |This is the only case where this line is relevant and not fucking annoying. Hats off.

        |ID: c4lx20w, Author: maledicted
        |Finally, an appropriate usage of this. My life is now complete. Thank you.

        |I sort of expected that as a line at the end of the story.

        |Happy Cake Day!

        |ID: c6t1g4q, Author: vincentrose88
        |Funny that I stumbled upon your comment on your cake day.

        |ID: c54wn0o, Author: Geek1599
        |Perfect. Response. Have an upvote

    |I am a culinary student, and a mighty fine baker. My baking instructor taught us that MANY bakers/ bakeries/ catering companies/ restau
    |ants use cake mix, and why use cake mix? Its quite simple, its what we expect. If you make a cake from scratch, it has a totally differ
    |nt flavor, different textures and other little things. As Americans we expect cakes to taste like boxed cake mix. If we went to Europe,
    |you would be shunned. Dont feel bad, if you can ice a cake, you have my respect.   

        |ID: c4izt6q, Author: iGotYouThisCake
        |That makes me feel better haha.//I'm awesome at making pies and tarts and such. And I'm completely 100% self taught. //I make pie c
        |usts that make people freak out. People tell me my pies are better than their mothers. That makes me feel good about myself since I
        |make all that. I just could never get that cake thing down...

        |ID: c4js7k0, Author: chillum
        |This is so true. My mom has made cakes from scratch on occasion. One of the times she offered a piece up to me, she and my dad put 
        | bet on whether I would like her cake or a box cake taste better. I definitely preferred the box cake. Granted, my mom is not a bak
        |r (though she's a great cook). But she and my dad -- who are both immigrants -- would finish and enjoy her cakes, while I was just 
        |ot a fan/wouldn't touch em.

        |Damn right! Try that any where near where my parents live (southern France) and the pitchforks would certainly come out.

        |&gt;If we went to Europe////And WHERE exactly is this mythical land of "Europe"???////http://www.fodors.com/community/europe/europe
        |n-bread-vs-us.cfm////Most people become "accustomed" to certain foods made certain ways, typically related to things they liked or 
        |hich gave them "comfort" as a child.////Take the majority of people from one snobby-village in France to a *different* snobby villa
        |e in another part of France and generally they would very likely turn up their noses at the common local fare ("not as good as we m
        |ke in Beumont Sur Mer" etc.)////The same will generally be true of Greeks, Italians, Germans, Flemish... *ad nauseum*. Oh sure, Ger
        |ans might like and appreciate some French pastries, or Greek breads, etc. but if the French/Greek/Whatever attempted to make baked 
        |oods that were *identical to the kind the Germans has become accustomed to in their own home region* they would be aghast at how po
        |r the quality would seem by comparison, regardless of how "celebrated" the baker (or restaurant) was.

        |I know man!!

    |ID: c4iy7iq, Author: thecommunistdaughter
    |I have done this for many years as well. All through high school everyone always told me I should go to culinary school because I would
    |bring cupcakes at least once a week and always get a ton of compliments. I mean, I **can** cook good cakes from scratch but it's a ton 
    |f work and there is always a lot to clean up. Betty Crocker has been doing it for much longer than I have so I trust her almost every t
    |me.

    |ID: c4ixvuz, Author: caltrask55
    |That is awesome!

    |ID: c4j26zt, Author: Socks_In_The_Mirror
    |Thank you for this. It was nice to laugh amidst stories of rape, murder, and incest.////Edit: Maybe everyone else is too mature, but I 
    |an't figure out why this hasn't been said yet. The cake is a lie.

        |ID: c4j2akp, Author: iGotYouThisCake
        |Haha I'm glad I could impose a bit of humor. Everyone has made me feel a bit better about the whole thing!////A couple of people ma
        |e the joke haha. They're buried in here somewhere! I never expected this many comments!

    |Rename your business Placebo's Cakes and see if anybody picks up on it. 

    |ID: c4j265u, Author: Rosenkrantz_
    |Pro'lly someone said this before, but if I may:////Eating a cake is not just the baked part. It is the decoration, which you must be gr
    |at at. It's the occasion (wedding receptions? woo-hoo!) and most of all the people who you have the cake with that make it tasty. It's 
    |ike drinking and even smoking: It's a social thing.////What really makes it , tho, is the love you put into it. You're the cake girl. N
    |w go get 'em, tigress!

    |ID: c5jm6e1, Author: PD711
    |It's the tears in the cake mix.  The tears make all the difference.

    |ID: c4ixwl8, Author: donttellmother
    |As an icing lover I say fuck baking cake too. In fact, the whole world has the ratio wrong. It should be a slab of icing with a smear o
    | sponge on top (which you shouldn't have to bake).

        |We can only dream!

    |ID: c4j01u0, Author: yoshifan64
    |To be fair, though, decorating cakes is pretty amazing. Also, don't throw around the word "lie" with "cake." I am so tempted to make a 
    |oke. Just on edge about the reference. 

        |ID: c4j0az1, Author: iGotYouThisCake
        |I've always considered the art of it to be my trade. The cake beneath is somewhat incidental to me. Most of what I do is super cust
        |m. 

    |ID: c5jb1no, Author: kajarago
    |My mom also makes cakes to sell like you do, she makes the fondant and icing from scratch, like you do, and she also uses cake mix, lik
    | you do.  She uses another brand though, something like Wilton or Walton or something like that which is *supposed to be* a higher end 
    |ake mix.  I can't tell the difference in taste or texture, honestly.////She would also 100% agree with you that the customer pays for t
    |e decoration, not what the bread is made of.  Baking that shit is the easy part.  The hard part is making the decorations, the flowers,
    |basket weave-looking thingies, etc.////I know you made this post about 2 months ago, this one just kinda hit close to home :)

    |Thanks for sharing. I made a cake for a friend's wedding about 15 years ago. It was my first wedding cake, I told her I knew what I was
    |doing - LIE. I used Pilsbury and claimed scratch-made, too. //I also did not know it was a bad idea to roll out fondant on a bench that
    |was regularly used for chopping raw jalapenos for jalapeno-cheddar bagels. Wedding cakes are clearly not my thing. 

        |ID: c4j24s7, Author: iGotYouThisCake
        |Oh man I am cracking up over this. ////I once had some friends ask to borrow my wedding cake pan set. Thinking it couldn't be that 
        |ard to make a cake for her friend's wedding. They called me no less than 6 times that day for advice and help. They ended up bringi
        |g was basically looked like a pile of cake with some fondant flopped over it to this poor girl's wedding. ////They attempted to mak
        | a three tier cake without any supports, only made one layer for each tier so it was really short and strange looking, and they bas
        |cally shredded the cake when they tired to frost it. ////That was the day I realized not everyone can do what I do. Up until that p
        |int, I had truly believed what I did wasn't that special. 

    |ID: c4lbil8, Author: AvenueWho
    |I worked for a high-end specialty cake bakery that uses Duncan Hines, and I happen to know that a really large and successful cupcake f
    |anchise also uses (barely) doctored Pilsbury.////It's pretty common. Someone once told me that it was basically just paying a bit more 
    |o have someone else weigh out the sugar and flour for them. ////I don't personally like the taste of box mix (I didn't grow up with it 
    |o it's a little weird to me), so I do my cakes from scratch, but I don't think you need to feel bad about this. People clearly love you
    | product, and they're paying you because they do. Chin up, fellow Baketress.

    |I am a qualified pastry chef. I did a four-year apprenticeship to earn that, and let me tell you what I think of this.////It's not a bi
    | deal. Lots of patisseries use premix for cakes and cookies, the only difference is that they buy it in 25kg bags.

    |ID: c60l0pz, Author: Snickersaw943
    |Same here!! I make cakes and all ive ever used was dunken hines. Its awesome, and I know that MANY people use box mix for their cake bu
    |iness. Dont be ashamed, Its good for everyone! Its cheaper and faster for you which brings your cost down and their cost down as well.

    |I have been in the cooking field for years and went to culinary school.   I love baking from scratch just because I know I can and I ba
    |e anything I can from scratch.  But the fact that you have made a living off of doing this is so cool in my opinion.  I cannot stand si
    |ting around for hours while you wait for the dough/cake mixes to be ready, but you can do it all right away.  So lucky.  I salute you m
    | friend and congratulations on all of your success.  :)

    |I make cake toppers and the supplies all cost like a dollar and I charge 40 bucks for my time making them. I felt kinda bad about it be

    |This is awesome. I also ran a very successfull cake biz for years and hardly ever baked my own cakes. Like you, I was really a decorato
    | at heart, I had been doing it for years and that was my true passion...the fondant work, the frosting....but I HATED baking!!! I tried
    |to bake from scratch but it never tasted as good as boxed cake!!! I even went a step further than you and would visit my local "big cos
    | savings" type store and get CASES OF FROZEN SHEET CAKE. Seriously. People complimented me ALL the time. Hilarious!!! I even made my we
    |ding cakes and celebrity's cakes from this stuff. Frozen, pre-made sheet cake. It was actually okay stuff....I mean, I made my own icin
    | and filling so yes, the cakes did taste fine and they looked great. I just hated baking and still do. But I did on many occasions get 
    |1 cake mix just like you, from our grocery outlet store. I'd always be sneaky too...scarred I'd see a customer. Haha. Still makes me la
    |gh! Only person that knew was also my husband. So funny! Thank you for posting. I just had to respond- because your story is SO my stor
    |!!! //Also- my friends all thought I was slaving away in the kitchen and I can not count ALL the times my friends would want to come he
    |p me bake or teach them how to bake or give them pointers...I just wanted to be like, "buy a box of cake mix and add water &amp; oil!" 
    |ol!!!!

        |ID: c4jkrpe, Author: iGotYouThisCake
        |Oh my goodness this makes me feel so much better!!!! My friends offer to help me all the time and I always say no Hahahaha //I made
        |a cake for a celebrity once. A famous musician with several gold/platinum records. He absolutely loved his cake so I didn't feel ba
        | at all, but I felt silly at home making it because there I was baking all these box cakes to carve up into this colossal custom ca
        |e for this guy haha. ////Seriously, thank you for commenting!

    |In fairness, as a former pastry chef, making a good genoise cake base is no easy task. Perfecting it takes a lot of effort, timing and 
    |n excellent oven. Don't feel bad about taking short-cuts if your end result and motivation is making people happy. Especially if your p
    |imary focus is on developing your decorating skills. I would suggest in the long term to try making a few small scale [genoise cakes](h
    |tp://www.whiskblog.com/2010/02/genoise-with-chantilly-cream-and.html) to increase your repertoire. Just don't get discouraged, no one s
    |cceeds at first.  A Kitchenaid helps as well. Lastly I'd suggest infusing your cake bases with liquor (eg. Crème de cacao) by dabbing w
    |th a pastry brush to increase it's richness if needed. Good luck and don't feel bad, whatever your path bringing people happiness is a 
    |oble profession.

        |I adore my kitchenaid. I actually live where they were first invented and built and I have a workhorse of a vintage machine from wh
        |n Hobart built them that refuses to give up. //I do add things like fresh fruit, quality chocolate and other special things here an
        | there to the mix. I also brush my cakes with simple syrup to ensure moisture. ////And you're right :)//Making people happy is my m
        |in goal. There's something about getting a custom cake that really lights up a person's face.
