Hugh Jackman recognises former student !(/r/Videos)




    |You can't really say you're out of shape because of ignorance if your PE teacher went on to become Wolverine.


        |I never would go on the gym floor when I was in 9th grade because of some REAL ass hole bullies. Turns out my teacher s
        |ill wanted me to get the most of it, and let me use the weight-room every time. Real good guy.


            |And who did your teacher become?   Mark Wahlberg?


                |He actually use to a [professional baseball player](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Godby), haha. So he actu
                |lly went from that to a gym teacher. Kind of reverse. 


                    |Until I looked at the link I thought you were taught by Kenny Powers.


                    |Kenny f*ckin Powers//


                        |There's no "I" in team but theres still a "U" in cunt, so don't be one!


                        |That's Kenny **FUCKIN** Powers to you.


                        |I play real sports. Not trying to be the best at exercising. Fuck this guy.


                        |Kenny Powders!

                        |Do we have to run the mile?


                    |Hey go Cardinals!


                    |We apparently went to the same High School!  CHS '98


                    |Holy Crap! I wish my teacher was a cardinal you're so lucky!


                    |It may be weirdly common. I went to a backwoods high school and we had three guys in different positions ar
                    |und the school that had played professional sports. One was a coach that played for the Steelers, another w
                    |s the in-school suspension guy and played with (IIRC) the Raiders, and our assistant principal had played p
                    |o baseball at some point, though I don't remember the team. They always ate lunch together at the front of 
                    |he cafeteria... the former pro clique, I guess.////None of them had a very illustrious career, obviously, b
                    |t I recall them all getting a lot of respect from our athletes/being generally good role models. These were
                    |the guys that would appear out of thin air when a fight broke out and put a full stop to it in a matter of 
                    |econds.////Edit: I remembered the assistant principal's full name, so I looked it up. He was drafted by the
                    |former California Angels in '69.


                    |Our high school weight lifting coach was actually supposed to be in the 80' olympics in Moscow but the U.S.
                    |decided to boycott it so he absolutely hates Jimmy Carter. I wish I could remember his name and see if he h
                    |d like a wiki page or something but alas my memory has never been to sharp.


                    |Go Cards!!


                    |Says in there he taught at a school in West Virginia... I'm sorry man...


                    |He had quite an illustrious major league career...

            |That's actually pretty bad-ass.  Did you get super swole by the end of the year and your bullies no longer recogniz
            |d you or did you crush your enemies, perhaps both?


                |Sadly no, I would just use the tread mill and do cardio mostly. The story following on *what happened* to the '
                |ing leader' of the bullies is a little dark, and I regret nothing.


                    |Ohhh, I like dark! Do tell. 


                        |Well, I'm not very good at things like this seeing as I type like a 15 year old instead of a 22 year ol
                        | but I'll give it a shot.////I was honestly phsyically, and mentally bullied by a group of 'rednecks' s
                        |nce middleschool all the way up to high school. I won't go into detail, so lets skip to my last day I a
                        |tended as a senior. ////I told the bully that morning if he doesn't stop driving me crazy, and fucking 
                        |ith me that I was going to stab him. I guess he took it as a joke because that day we got on the shop b
                        |s (Those unfamiliar with that, it's just a class you take mid day for trade skills) he actually slapped
                        |me in the face. That was ALMOST it, I was ALMOST at my breaking point here. Well, we end shop get back 
                        |n the bus and as he's getting on this time he makes a bottle-cap shooter and launching one right at me.
                        |Needless to say it hit me in the face...////Well I'm sitting at the lunch table deciding not to even ea
                        | that day, and I ask my *best* friend for his knife. I tell him "I might need this today..." he didn't 
                        |hink I was too serious I believe, and just handed it to me. I put it in my pocket. Well as the bully is
                        |walking past me he shoves a book over the table top and it pelts me in the chest. Fuck it, I'm done. Lu
                        |ch ends, and I'm in a mood I'd never been in before. THE bully says in 6th period to me "Man, I'm sorry
                        |about everything. Let's just be cool." and there it was. The end I thought. I said "Okay, what ever man
                        |" ////Well 7th period rolls around, our last period...and his friends, along wityh him are throwing so 
                        |uch shit at my friend and I all class. The class ends, and we're walking out of the room, and he turns 
                        |round and says "you BETTER not stab me" (Note: i didn't even have the knife out at this time...) he pro
                        |eeds to kick me in the nuts (REALLY hard) and punches me in the fact, resulting in my tooth going THROU
                        |H my lip. I fall backwards...my friend pushes me up and says "Get him!" I just pull the knife out and s
                        |ab him four times. Once in the neck, the shoulder, and twice in the side. I hardly even remember doing 
                        |his, I was in a state of mind I'd never been in before.////I proceed to scream while he is bleeding eve
                        |ywhere "You will NEVER fuck with anyone again you piece of shit. You've treated me like COMPLETE garbag
                        | for over 8 years and I'm SICK of it! You're a fucking piece of TRASH and you DESERVE this."  Meanwhile
                        |everyone is in awe, and he is just looking at me holding his neck with tears forming up in his eyes. I 
                        |roceed to calmly give the knife to a teacher, and walk into a class room, sit down and waited to be arr
                        |sted. ////There is more to the story, but I'm sure I've bored you all enough. 


                            |*There is more to the story, but I'm sure I've bored you all enough*////Yeah not really, what happe
                            |ed next ?


                                |Okay. I'll continue then.////Well the whole fact that the higher ups did absolutely NOTHING abo
                                |t this was the saddest thing of all. My mother had went in numerous times when I didn't know an

                                |t they would do SOMETHING about this, but alas nothing ever happened.////So I ended up being co
                                |tacted by a very prestige lawyer that got me out of juvenile dentition early. We planned to sue
                                |the Board of Education, and went through a FOUR year lawsuit. They played really dirty this ent

                                |ther kids. ////Well, the day came 4 years later and they were ready to settle, and my lawyer op

                                |7 days in the dentition center, a month of house arrest, and 6 months of probation. //I really 
                                |as a decent kid in HS too, believe it or not. I kept to my self, and tried to just get through

                            |There's more? Did the bully walk into the classroom where you were waiting and ask for tree fiddy?


                            |I got picked on from 3rd grade to Sophomore year. I finally started fighting back. It was so great

                    |&gt;The story following on what happened to the 'ring leader' of the bullies is a little dark, and I regret
                    |nothing.////Stop teasing us!


            |what?


            |My gym teacher did the same thing! I wouldn't really call the guys bullies, but I'm not really bothered by much. Ma
            |be I just didn't care/notice.////ANYWAY, it was just me and another girl with the entire football team in gym class
            | I most definitely wasn't able to compete with their physical abilities and skills, so my teacher let me and the ot
            |er girl go to the weight room to lift and run every day.


            |Why not stop the bullies instead ;)?


            |I never went on the gym floor because our teacher always sat in his chair and made us play basketball while the gir
            |s gym teacher let them do all sorts of awesome stuff.  PE sucked, but at least I had my buds to make it bearable.


            |That teacher? Einstein!


            |We had a coach that was always pushing us to run. No bullshit kind of guy. To his credit he would usually run with 
            |s but he was overly harsh to those of us that aren't very good at it  (my knees are shot and I was a senior in a fr
            |shman gym class so I... I didn't really ever run).  One girl started complaining about pain and couldn't really run
            |well. She kept wanting to sit down and he kept pushing her. It went like that for weeks until on her 15th birthday 
            |he was diagnosed with leukemia, the pain being a side effect. ////I felt a little bad for him, you could tell he fe
            |t bad about it. He wasn't a bad guy he just wouldn't budge on his "no excuses" personality. He did a bit after that
            |though. ////Edits : because swype and my inability to spell check 


            |Similar story to this.  I was a fat kid and very shy about getting nearly naked around 20 other people.  He had a t
            |ing that if we missed a day dressing out for PE he'd let us do a lap around the track.  Didn't help me as, well, yo
            | still had to dress out.  He'd do this once every 2 weeks.  So he came to me and asked about it.  I told him what w
            |s up.  So he'd stay after school (when he typically jsut left) and would wait for me to dress out and do laps until
            |I was done.  Which, would take a while sometimes.  Only time I ever passed PE.


            |In 9th grade I took a weight training course but it was primarily filled with football players, so I was on a much 
            |ifferent fitness scale and as a result never kept up with it afterwards.

            |Looks like Hugh skipped leg day


                |I doubt anyone who skipped leg day could deadlift 400+ lbs.


            |yeah I'm go ahead and say he's using steroids, sad...


                |Please tell us how sad he is because he used a cycle or two then got paid millions of dollars to play wolverine


                |A) Not sad////B) That and more is perfectly achievable natty.


                |Certainly steroids, but I wouldn't say sad. Just part of the business.


        |Every one of my phys ed teachers in school were shit teachers, assuming I knew the rules and purpose to all games and u

                    |d to some of the great Valjeans in the past. The gamble they took to record the music live instead of recor
                    |ing it in a studio and then lip-synching did not pay off, in my opinion.


                    |You can't really hold too much singing against a musical. What were they supposed to do? Cut out have the s
                    |ngs and convert them to dialogue, and piss off all of the fans of the stage show?

            |Yep, with the video of the post I was wondering if they'd talked before, but now it's clear that he just recognised
            |him when he saw him.


                |Hugh Jackman was on the radio the other day when I was driving (I'm from Australia). They talked about it and h

            |I basically fell in love with Hugh Jackman because of this interview. 


                |Like you weren't in love with him before!


            |To be fair, I think it'd be easier to recognize people from a class you taught for one year than a class you taught
            |for multiple years.  Then you'd have 3-4 times the number of students to remember.


            |When he did that head shake and smiled, you could just tell he remembered him and was going to have his fun.


            |Was alcohol involved?////


            |I am convinced that there are just some people who get very personal and genuine with others; to the point where th

            |alking down the hall and the principal stopped me and asked if I went to that school. I said yes and he said "I've 
            |ever seen you before." I've been going to that school for a couple of years by then. That's a good thing though. At
            |least in my opinion it is. Means you've never been in trouble (or at least caught). 


            |I don't know, we would joke around a lot and have fun in his class with him, I think he's just kind of old and a li
            |tle bit (actually really) crazy.


            |well that's how your brain works. it eliminates the useless stuff and saves whatever stands out. I still remember M
            |. Romano From 5th Grade man that dude was the Bill Nye of our School. he had a passion for science! 


            |When my friend's mother went to speak to one of our new teachers (mind you, this was like 2 weeks after school bega
            |) he told her "Madam, I have no idea who your son is. Which is good, because if I knew already, it would mean he'd 
            |e a pest"


            |So, does that mean if I went back to school and was recognized by a few teachers, that I am one of those three?


            |&gt;In my experience as a teacher, the kids I remember are the brilliant ones, the charismatic ones and the really 
            |eally bad ones.////*...Pinkman?*


            |&gt;the charismatic ones and the really really bad ones.////Seems like I totally nailed 2/3 for PE.////...////I'm o
            | with that.


            |Or if you have a goofy ass name like Rollo.


            |TIL I was memorable as fuck.


            |Truth hurts.


            |I have prosopagnosia (can't recognize faces) and I myself actually tried very hard to fly under the radar. I think 
            |ecause I can't recognize people myself, I don't want them to recognize me either. I really hope it worked. Do you r
            |member me? No? Aha!


            |Shit. Now I wonder why everyone always was so quick to recognize me ....


            |So you're saying I was a character because apparently when teachers see my parents around town they always ask abou
            | how I'm doing. 


        |I'm pretty sure my PE instructor was some sort of pedophile. If you didn't have tits than he didn't know your name.////

            |Twist: Chase82 went to an all boys school.


            |An ephebophile is just a pedophile with a thesaurus


                |When I think pedophiles, I think young, very young, where ephebophiles are into an older, but still young, age 
                |ange. 14-16 years or so.


            |pedophiles aren't interested in tits, doe


                |i think people think your saying pedophiles aren't interested in girls, but what you're actually saying is pedo

                |His PE teacher sounds normal to me.


                |And here I thought it was a blanket term. Apparently, I should have used "Ephebophile".


                    |Trust me, NO ONE cares except on reddit... and it kind of makes you wonder why they do care on reddit.


                        |Because redditors like puns, sarcasm, wit, tits, and most importantly being technically correct.


                |Holy shit you've been downvoted...wtf?


                |I think most people classify an adult attracted to anyone under 18 as pedophiles.


                    |I'm pretty sure pedophiles are strictly attracted to prepubescent kids so about 11 years of age and under a
                    |d ephebophiles are attracted to pubescent teens. 


                        |I know that, hence "most people". But when some teacher molests a 16 year old female student, what I'm

                    |Most people are pretty damn stupid too


            |My drafting teacher was like that. He didn't talk to girls, he talked to their breasts. It was creepy as fuck to wa
            |ch. 


                |Dude always gave me the creeps. It wasn't until like 10 years later when I saw him at the bar hitting on 18 yea
                | olds that it really clicked.


            |don't kid yourself; he's a pedophile


        |Sorry to hear that Sue Heck.


        |Sorry about that bro. My teachers seem to remember me because I was always the shitty students. Actually just like a ye
        |r or two ago my chemistry teacher actually blackmailed me. I had to start making meth for him.


            |Did u also know some crazy Chinese guy names Julio who introduced you to tuco Salamanca//


                |That was an oddly specific question


        |My pe teacher told me to find him after high school. After I got out of boot camp. Its been hard looking because that s
        |me year they let him go. I thought it would be easier since he has a unique name. I hope he does remember me when I do 
        |ind him. He was one of my better teachers. 


        |I walked into my class and my current PE teacher (has had me a year and half a term) went "Are you in this class?" She 
        |lways calls me the wrong name, even though I correct her every time.  


            |Show her your 15 incher and she'll remember you for life.


        |My first grade teacher recognized me when I ran into her 20 years later at a grocery store or something. I was blown aw
        |y. Funny thing is I remember her well too but I couldn't even tell you the name of most of my other teachers.//


        |One of my PE teachers didn't even recognise me while he was teaching me. Can't really blame him though since I didn't t
        |rn up to his class even once... Man I fucking hated PE


        |I had an english teacher who didn't count me absent one day because she didn't know that I existed.  //There was like t

        |In class right now, teacher doesn't recognize me ...


        |Hugh probably recognizes the kids name from his press badge. Rollo's the kind of name that would stand out. Doesn't nec
        |ssary mean he recognized the actual kid by face or had any last memory of him other than his name (mind you, he might h

            |, the more you can lose, and the more you can lose, the sharper your quality of life can decline- or so it seems. W
            |en you have to worry about your many cars, houses, boats, and whatever else you may have acquired- it is a much big
            |er source of stress than people may realize because for most of us, owning millions of dollars of property seems li
            |e it would be awesome. ////Also, "nothing to worry about" as a celebrity or rich individual? Really? Last I checked

                |Actually, studies have shown that more money = more happy to a certain extent. Then it just levels off at the "

                    |Actually that basically says that having money gives you a sense of success, something our society has dril

            |Sadly for sambrero, nobody are going in there.


            |Actually I'm a bit of a depraved cunt.

            |Where have you been looking?

        |I had the same feeling sitting in my chair.  What an awesome fellow.  Just have to remember that we are all uniquely be

            |Not true in the least. If that was true, everyone would be a movie star. Not everyone is "beautiful" or even pleasi
            |g to look at.


    |When was Hugh Jackman a PE teacher?  Wikipedia has failed me.


        |"*Following graduation, he spent a gap year working at Uppingham School in England*."  //Straight from the wiki.////[So
        |rce](http://www.uppingham.co.uk/hollywood-star-hugh-jackman-returns-to-uppingham)


            |Which isn't anywhere near London, despite what he said


                |If it's not on Wikipedia, it must be a lie.


                |It's only a 2 hour drive away


        |Wiki article says he spent a year working at an English school after graduation, guess that's it.


        |[Here's an article on the subject of his time teaching](http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2009/04/27/hugh
        |jackman_feature.shtml)


    |TIL Hugh Jackman was a teacher.


        |Sting, from The Police, was also a teacher.


            |If I was in that class I'd have just swooned all day and I'm a guy


            |...I always thought "don't stand so close to me“ was inspired by Lolita, but maybe it came from personal experience
            |..


        |I can't find anything on his Wikipedia bio about it. Odd.


        |I'm guessing as a sports assistant as a student. We get quite a few Aussies who come over to public schools (like Uppin
        |ham) in their gap years to help out with rugby and sports.


        |TIL Rollo is a name.


        |Not really a teacher. It's kind of a thing here for aussie gap students to come to public schools and help out with PE.


    |Dammit Rollo, did you forget your kit again?


        |Just wondering, does "bring your kit" mean bring your gear, or does it mean like "bring your A game" or "hustle"?


            |PE outfit, like your gym shorts and shirt or w/e.


            |Bring your kit means bring your sports clothes. Pretty standard school slang in the UK and presumably in Australia 
            |oo.


                |Confirmed also in Australia. ////Source: Am Australian. Also always 'accidentally' forgot my PE gear. 


                |Now they're just some country that we used to own.


            |Gear. PE attire etc.


            |It means bring your PE clothes.


            |In the UK, kids have to bring in their "PE kit" on days where they have PE (Physical Education) which is basically 
            |horts, a t-shirt and suitable shoes. It's often just shortened to "kit"


            |your uniform i believe.


            |The former.


            |The first one.//


            |wow why hasn't anyone answered you


            |sounds like he could be referring to a cricket kit

                |FALSE.


        |I went to an international highschool in the US.  ALL the gym teachers were from the UK.  ////I was surprised to learn 
        |hat "kit" wasn't the standard word here.


    |I think it's cool that the interviewer wasn't all like "YOU USED TO TEACH ME REMEMBER ME OMG"

        |Cheers cunt.//


            |Yeah! What's up paddy bastard?

    |Why is he so perfect!!!


    |Still too tall for Wolverine.   But just right for the Gunslinger in Dark Tower.

            |There was a lot of talk a year ago with Ron Howard to direct it with it being split into a few movies with a mini s

            |nths ago Ron said it is still being worked on, but they decided to no longer talk about it publicly. He even gave a
            |few details on his adaptation which would start with the drawing of the three on the beach to establish charaters,

        |I never thought of this until you said that, and I think it would be a great idea.


        |I know, right? I've never seen him taller than an A4 piece of paper in the comics, yet on a cinema screen he looks giga
        |tic!


        |Wow, I just realized that he was who I imagined being Roland the entire time I was reading the Gunslinger. He would be 
        |o perfect.


        |But too short to play Tony Kukoc.


    |My mom plays FFXI with Rollo; she's so tickled about this video going viral. He gets to interview and hang out with celebri
    |ies, and then goes back to FFXI and talks about it, haha.


    |I got to talk to him last weekend at the Zurich Film Festival!


        |What did you talk about?


            |I only talked to him for a bit, but we discussed the new Wolverine movie and his appearance on Korean television a 
            |ouple months back.


    |Its in leicester not london, my ex used to go there! //he also joined the gym in my town when they filmed Les Mis here, rea
    |ly nice guy apparently 


        |It's not in Leicester, it's in Rutland ;).


            |haha well played


        |Fun fact for non-brits. Leicester is pronounced lɛstər which is basically "lester".////Leicestershire is pronounced les
        |ersherr. //////What a magnificent language, aye? 


            |U wot m8?


                |Cheerio, pip pip!  Bloody hell!  Gov'na!////*Dear Diary.  So far the Brits suspect nothing.*


                    |&gt; Dear Diary. So far the Brits suspect nuffin


            |I say it sheer not sherr


                |Might be. Depends on where in GB you live, I assume.


                    |I also say sheer, have never heard it pronounced sherr and I'm actually from Leicestershire! Interesting st
                    |ff! 


                        |Well, I guees you're more right, then. I'm just a anglophile Dane, so.. I've been to GB several times t
                        |ough, but the closest I came to Leicester was Leamington Spa. My point is just that shire only sounds l
                        |ke sheer if you pronounce sheer in british aswell. Some pronounce sheer like shear, and that's not quit
                        | it.//


                        |I think the most common way of saying it, apart from sheer, is she(r) with almost a silent r.


            |Just like how Gloucestershire is basically "Gloster-sheer".////English accents are *weird*


                |I still laugh when I think back to Johnny Knoxville trying to pronounce Warwickshire. Basically broke it down a
                |d pronounced it as the three separate words 'war'wick'shire' //


                    |Ehhh... How do you pronounce it then?


                        |Warrick-sher, depending on where you're from the ending can be a little different. Silent 'w's' eh? 


            |If you were a true Brit you'd know that "aye"=/="eh". "Aye" is pronounced similarly to "eye" and it means "yes".///
            |For example////"You comin' down pub tonight?"//"Aye"


        |Obviously a very nice guy, seeing as he went to the same gym as you now ex.


            |what?


                |It was a joke about him stealing your gf. Albeit poorly done.


                    |Haha ahh okay! Not sure how I would feel about hugh Jackman stealing my ex, should be angry, but would also
                    |make for a good pub story/get me in the next wolverine film


    |The man is just.... Wow *melts*


    |AMA request: Rollo


    |Hugh Jackman looks different here. Last movie I watched that he was in he looked bigger.


        |*Acting*


        |Yeah, he tends to change his build from movie to movie. For instance you look at him in scenes from Les Mis, and compar
        | it to scenes from Wolverine, and he looks completely different. 


            |Dat dere celltech (srs)


            |The best case I've seen of this is Christian Bale. He went from looking like [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cXnGb

            |s. He actually gained too much and had to lose weight/muscle for Batman Begins because he looked too big and muscul
            |r for the role as Batman relies more on his agility than brute strength. 


                |Same with Tobey Maguire -- he almost didn't do Spiderman 2 because he had to put so much weight back on after s
                |imming down significantly to play a jockey in Seabiscuit.


                |Hormones!////Still a lot of work to do that.

    |Rollo's motto for life: I was trained by Wolverine.


    |Top bloke. 


    |Fuck sake Rollo


    |God damnit Rollo.


    |Hugh Jackman was a teacher?


    |Wolverine was your fucking gym teacher, that's wild.


    |He's just mad because he's jealous. If Professor X asks you to jump into the pool, you fucking do it.


    |At Comic Con this year Hugh Jackman was the ONLY celeb I saw walk away from his private car (most celebs were being shuffle
    | inside through a little hallway away from the public) and toward a crowd of fans who were hoping to get a glimpse of him. 
    |ot only did he meet every one of them (within a reasonable distance from his guards) but he signed posters and took pics wi
    |h kids. I was watching everything from the top of a parking garage, and most celebs straight up ignored everyone. Just watc
    |ing him made me realize he is a good person inside, and this confirms it for me. ////edit: hugh jackman and aaron paul are 
    |robably the nicest actors in hollywood


    |Fucking Rollo


    |God, watching that clip sent me onto the longest Youtube surf... But i'm finally back.


    |Reminds me of a story I heard on a wrestling forum years ago.  Someone had met Terry Funk at an event, and they had a brief
    |conversation where Funk told him to stay out of trouble, or something to that effect.  Years later, the person met Funk aga
    |n, and Terry recognized him right away.  Considering the number of shots Terry Funk has taken to the head over the years, t
    |at's pretty bloody amazing IMO :P
