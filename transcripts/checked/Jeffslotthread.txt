                |Happy cake day


            |Funny I see this same question on every single one of his posts and yet everyone is amazed when it works. Gets me e
            |erytime.


            |People ask this everytime he comments it makes me so happy, because the response is always a link to his sub.


            |You tell us./////r/pm_me_your_tits_girl


        |No this is what the sub /r/trees is all about right guys? I always hear them talking about ents, this has got to be wha
        | they're talking about. 


            |First time I visited /r/tress I was really confused.  I've never smoked myself and my reaction was something like "
            |here are the trees?  Oh.......... ok." As someone who spends time outside photographing nature, I was a bit disappo
            |nted I didn't get to see neat pics of trees.  So I immediately had to fix my confusion and actually find a subreddi
            | that had trees in it!  I just wanted to see trees dammit!  


                |If you like actual trees you should check out /r/marijuanaenthusiasts


                    |Ok, so I thought you were joking so in my head I was like "haha very funny dude. *click the mouse button." 
                    | clicked it expecting it to be what the title says it is.  All this time and I have never clicked that link
                    |because I thought it was a link for SUPER marijuana enthusiasts.  


                        |Oh, shit. I've never clicked on that sub, for that same reason. Well played, reddit.  


                |/R/Marijuanaenthisiests  and /r/treessyckingatthings


                    |Second link is broken bud.  Try again and I will click it.


        |What does MFA think of these pants? How do they fit compared to dockers alpha khakis or Levis 511's?


        |They'd tell him to wear lower rise pants to make his torso look more in proportion because as it stands, he looks a bit
        |leggy.


        |/r/nicepants


        |There's no way they would approve.


    |Is that you Peeta?


        |[Psst](http://i.imgur.com/pMy9z.jpg)


            |This is pretty funny.


                |Judging by my yellow socks, yeah. Funny.


        |That was [my first thought too.](http://i.imgur.com/iZNzKJl.jpg)


            |Dude I am so stone-d.


        |Obviously being a baker let's him masterfully create these pants entirely out of icing.


        |This comment takes the cake.

    |I can't believe he got caught wearing those after Arbor Day.

    |is that a fishing pole or an overly large pen that has a reel attached to it?


        |Looks like a fishing pole with spear attachment??

                        |Never used one but I'd assume you just reel the line in as it retracts and vice versa.

    |That's a nice pair of trunks right there.
