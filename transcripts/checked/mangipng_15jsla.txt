        |Such is the problem, in a drunken curiosity you scrape at the edge of the label testing the thoroughness of the bottling plants adh

        |l, it shreds halfway across. The jobs just half way done now so you go at it from the other corners.////Soon enough you've just got
        |a brown glass bottle wrapped in some white furry paper and sticky residue, the good part of the drunk is wearing off and you're alr

        |I'm with this guy, probably my most persistent beer drinking habit (other than drinking beer) is waiting until i can slide the labe

        |I used to work in a college bar and I did not care if people did this. What sucked is they left the labels on the ground and everyw
        |ere else you can imagine. People stick them to the wall, mirror, framed pictures ect. So just be courteous and throw the label away
        |so you don't create extra work.

        |Are you sexually active? I've heard that peeling can be a sign of sexual frustration. 

    |ID: c7n4e3e, Author: dingoitis
    |I've always been a label peeler, and if I'm at a party and a guy notices me doing it I get this line *every single time*:////"Did you k
    |ow that peeling the label is a sign of sexual frustration?"////Or how about I'm just fucking bored and peeling my goddamn label. .....W
    |ll that was a fun little trip down memory lane.

        |Excuse me dear lass, let me tell you a fable. Please let me speak while you peel that beer label. This guy right here can fix your 
        |ituation, whether it be boredom or even sexual frustration. This handsome guy, his name is Rex. Surprising or not he practices safe
        |sex. If you're not interested, it's all in good fun. Just wanted to ask, no need to run. So after all of this rhyming what do you s

        |ID: c7n5rr3, Author: vervii
        |Oh hah, next time I see someone peeling a label, "Did you know that peeling the label is a sign of pedophillic guilt?"

        |the golden response to this- "wanna fix that for me, sailor?" And now you have a fun game to play the rest of the night- Make Party

        |I used to collect singha labels and convinced people they were called singha dollars like Marlboro stubs, but in this day and age w

        |I never understood that. Whenever I hit the bar with my bros, I might get bored. I'll try to find something to do and turns out I'm
        |peeling this sticker; people will be like "ooohhh fizz4m is sexually frustrated"////I'm just peeling a goddamned sticker!

        |ID: c7n4nwp, Author: Warbond
        |That's obviously not true and I've never heard it. As sarcastic as that sounds, I'm serious, I've never heard the sexual frustratio
        | thing and there's no way it's true.

        |ID: c7n9qhf, Author: PatriciaMayonnaise
        |Also things that people have told me are surely a sign of sexual frustration:////Chewing ice////Bouncing leg/foot up and down////Bl

        |I only peel my label so that I can mark it as my beer. I have a tendency to take the label near the neck of the bottle (if there is
        |one) and flip it upside down.

        |ID: c7n4rxz, Author: just_leave_it
        |Why is it a bad habit? Why would anyone care if someone pulled off a label on their own bottle? I'm genuinely curious.

        |ID: c7n4r10, Author: SUSAN_IS_NOT_A_BITCH
        |I thought it was to know which beer was yours.

        |ID: c7ng3s8, Author: Bojangles010

        |If you are male and have not had sex in the last five minutes then it is clearly a sign of sexual frustration (ie. you are normal) 
        |f you are female then some guy is going to take the opportunity to break the ice by implying you are sexually frustrated (ie. you a

    |I often tear my beer label apart. ////What I hate the most is when your beer warms up whilst you're taking your anger out on the label,
    |so not only are you still bored when you're done, but now you've got to drink the warm camel piss out of the bottle :(

    |When I was a young drinker, this was actually turned into a game of sorts in my circle of friends. I'm not gonna say we invented it, I 
    |on't know how it came about, but here's how we did it:////If one successfully peeled off the front label of a bottle of beer, with no r
    |ps or tears, and a minimal amount of bunched paper (Heineken was declared cheating), and handed that fresh, crisp label to another pers
    |n, it was an invitation for sex. If that person later returned that label to you, it was acceptance of the offer - "let's go do it!" Ce
    |tain folks expanded the rules of the label game to include peeled rear labels as an invitation for anal, neck labels for oral. So if th
    |re were attractive young ladies at the bar, you can bet you'd see us meticulously picking at our beer bottles.

    |I've never in my life seen anyone peel the label off. Maybe I'm just not paying attention.

    |ID: c7nb0sq, Author: hambonese
    |I denounce this premise!  People peel labels because it's a fixation, not because there is an "awkward" moment happening.  I'm just sic
    | of this younger generation calling everything "awkward".  It's a tired over-response whenever someone disapproves of a social encounte
    |.  It's always the "Normal" person who feels uncomfortable, it's always the "normal" person who labels the other Awkward.  Did anyone s
    |op and think that this term is just a subconscious effort to make a person feel better about their own life.  My generation called ever
    |thing "gay".  That was gay, she was gay, that movie was totally fucking gay.  It seems that in this new age of political correctness th
    | name has shifted from gay to Awkward, and it's kind of tiring to me.  

        |ID: c7nb57p, Author: hambonese
        |And another thing if a social inept person labels themselves as "awkward" just think of the damage your doing to your ego and self 
        |onfidence.  Grow a pair and say "if you don't like it fuck off"!  that would be "Totes" Awkward...for them.//
