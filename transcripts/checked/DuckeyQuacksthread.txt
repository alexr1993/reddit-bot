    |Have you had many problems with excess skin?


        |Problems, not really.  Do I have excess skin.  Oh god yes.  Excess skin like you wouldn't believe.////It's an unfortuna
        |e part of weighing as much as I did, and there isn't much you can do about it outside of surgery.  While it isn't neces
        |arily a health hazard (there are some issues), it's extremely psychologically distressing, and I am actively pursuing o
        |tions to have it removed.


            |This is something I've always wondered about. So, is it never going to go away on its own? Even a little bit?


                |It's gotten better over time.  When a lot of people think of loose skin, they are actually thinking of loose sk
                |n AND the body fat beneath it.  Skin itself is very, very thin, and so continuing to lose body fat can actually
                |reduce the appearance of loose skin.////Overall though, I have hit the point where what's left is always going 
                |o be there, baring surgery.  I would say (in a completely subjective way) I saw a...50% reduction over time fro
                | loose skin at it's worst, and the remaining 50% is here to stay.


                    |See if you can sell your skin to that one weird company that makes human leather products. That could more 
                    |han pay for the surgery, possibly.


                        |Ew, *gross*.////I don't want stretchmarks on my wallet.


                        |I know this is a reference to the other thread about the weirdest thing to buy on the internet, but it'
                        | actually a terrible idea in reality. 


                        |This exists?


                        |I hear that 'weird company' has a thing for putting lotion on the skin.


                    |Start lifting and fill it out with muscle! I dont really know if that works, but it might to some degree lo
                    |. Or you'll be so yoked that people wont even think about your excess skin.


                        |It will help a little, but the loose skin will still be there. See older people that decide to finally 
                        |et in shape. They had loose/sagging skin from before and the muscles they enlarged only slightly hid th
                        | skin. ////You still are a total bamf if you can looked ripped at 60+; any age for that matter really. 


                            |That's kinda what I thought, but he could still look pretty beastly with some muscle, no doubt.


                        |Doesnt work.  Surgery is the only way to get rid of it.  I lost over 100 and know how it is.


                            |It really depends on where the skin is. If its around the midsection, it would be hard to fill out.
                            |Arms and chest might be easier to fill, sure it would take a while to gain a lot of muscle though.


                        |Yes this will definitely work. Swimming will help this a lot 


                    |Huh. Thanks.////Congratulations and good luck, by the way.


                    |I imagine the rate at which the weight was lost could be a contributing factor to the amount of excess skin


                    |Is surgery out of your price range? How much is the surgery? Do you have hangups about the surgery?


                    |I lost quite a bit of weight as well and have a small amount of excess skin on my belly, chest and arms. I'
                    | working at reducing that through exercise atm :)////I lost 64 kg btw :)


                    |Are you going to have surgery to remove what's left?


                    |I also went through a greater loss of bodyweight (from 310 to 180 lbs.) and I've reached a point where the 
                    |xcess skin actually gets worse by every pound I lose. If I went back up to the 190/200ish area it'd just lo
                    |k like I had some excess belly fat; if I went down another 10 lbs. my stomach would turn into Betty White's
                    |wrinkly ass all over again. 


                    |OMG I just realized, if you got rid of the skin, you could totally remove your belly button!  DO IT! :D


                |Nope. At least, not from what I've experienced. It's gone down a little bit with my working out, I can see hint
                | of a six pack through my skin on my stomach, but it never really goes away, hence, without surgery, I won't se
                | abs on my stomach. It looks a lot like fat when you're sitting down, too. It kind of jellos its way over the e
                |ge of your pants/shorts, creating a weird fat-except-not-fat looking thing on your waist.


                    |This is what I am dealing with. So disheartening :(


                        |How much do you have to weigh for this to be an issue?  


                |Does anyone know what the maximum of extra weight you can have is before you begin having excess skin if you lo
                |t the weight? All of the people who have lost 150-200 pounds always have excess skin, but what about people wit
                | 30-60 pounds? At what point do you cross over into the lots of excess skin realm?


                    |not sure were the cut off is, but i was 240 lb and at my lowest was around 160 lb when I went on atkins. I 
                    |idn't have any loose skin like I have seen with extreme weight loss. from my understanding if its a natural
                    |decline of loss weight that helps your body adjust to prevent loose skin.


                |I have had three skin correction done, due to my weight loss. My skin had stretched past the point of elasticit
                |. Its painful, and recovery sucks, a lot. 


                |From what I hear as an active member of /r/loseit and as someone actively losing massive amounts of weight, in 
                |is case a lot will likely go away on his own once his skin stretches back, though this could take years before 
                |ou see any huge improvement, and this can be sped up by gaining muscle to help fill it in, but in such extreme 
                |ases, I'm not sure if it will ever all be gone naturally.


                |Think of the extra skin as if it were laterally aligned scar tissue. Essentially, when skin stretches due to ob
                |sity, the body places skin cells next to normally developing skin in order to relieve the strain due to stretch
                |ng over time. Once all the weight is lost the strain is gone but all the extra produced skin cells remain, in a
                |manner very similar to scar tissue remaining. There is no un-stretching extra tissue. It has to be removed in a
                |manner similar to the removal of scar tissue.


            |I'd there any way you could fill it out with muscle? Or is there too much for that to be possible? 


                |Too much for that to be possible.  Losing as much body fat as I did (I am currently in the single digits, aroun
                | 8% I believe) has helped the extra skin be very, very thin, and muscle lines are clearly visible, but there's 
                | lot hanging.////Removal appears to be my only option.

                    | to exercise at pretty close to that same level throughout their lives; and that many would likely NOT do s
                    | and would suffer "flab" as a result.  And by contrast I was advised that the slow &amp; more "natural* acq
                    |isition of muscle (in one's late teens, twenties and even into one's 30's) would probably result in a bette

                    |nsider that to have been some of the best advice I ever got.  Twenty years after college the former quarter
                    |ack/body-builder types generally appear flabby &amp; fat (beer gut and large flabby arms, moobs, the whole

                        |Yeah, but it's also more incentive to keep working out. Muscle use and growth will fix this over time.


                        |Yeah, but it could also be motivation to save money for some skin surgery after losing the weight.

                |If I'm not mistaken, the problem with excess skin on overweight people following weight loss is not because the
                | haven't tried to fill it out. Skin is elastic and can only be stretched so much so many times. When you're sev
                |rely overweight your skin stretches until it loses just about all it's elasticity. That's how you get stretch m
                |rks. Your skin stretches to the point where it can't stretch anymore but your body "forces" it to stretch. Ther
                | are things you can do, but the easiest thing is to make sure you don't lose weight too quickly. Your skin, whi
                |h is an organ, won't have enough time to adapt to your body as it's changing. Your skin will eventually reshape
                |to fit your body after you lose weight, but it still may never look "natural."


                    |As an organ skin does grow and reduce itself, but there is a point where your skin becomes so stretched it 
                    |on't reduce any further.  I believe I am pretty close to that point, and my options are filling it out with

            |s avoiding the social aspects of food.  Like, going out to a restaurant and such.  Overall I found I had a lot of f

            |Earlier this year, I stopped eating because I was so severely stressed. For about 4 months my food intake just kind
            | dwindled down to nothing. I'm a naturally thin person to begin with so losing 10 pounds made more difference than

            |unger. I can't even imagine going a year like that. How long did it take you to get used to food again? 


    |Holy shit! When did the pain of starvation end?


        |Starvation stops hurting after a while.  The real difficulty is in the first few weeks, then you stop being hungry.  It
        |s been explained to me that during the starvation process, you sort of "burn out" your normal hunger feedback loop, and
        |so you stop being hungry all together.  This is problematic when you want to start recovery, because you're body is nev
        |r going to prompt you to eat; you have to do it yourself, yet because you want to restrict, you find yourself falling i
        |to a dangerous loop.////This sounds weird, but the stomach sickness that I felt still occasionally comes back when prom
        |ted by songs I would listen to on repeat while exercising, or by locations where I was in the midst of a heavy fast.


            |I can attest to this, not as a large man who starved himself on purpose, but a skinny man who starved himself by ac
            |ident. I got into really pathetic eating habits (barely consuming any food, maybe one meal a day, nothing to do wit
            | body image in the slightest). After a while you forget you are hungry, and it becomes hard to get excited about ea
            |ing something when you have no appetite.


                |This has literally been me forever. I'll force one huge meal down a day but I hate the process of eating.


                    |Yeeep.  Eating becomes a chore.  That is not a good place to be when you're actively restricting and at an

            |This actually happened to me a few years ago, while I wasn't on a starvation diet, one day I just stopped being hun
            |ry. It's incredibly hard to explain, it was such a religious experience. I wondered how long I could go without eat
            |ng, I personally went about six days, but stopped out of a mini-intervention. That was one hell of a week, I'd love
            |to reach that point again out of pure curiosity.


            |Do you have any thoughts about stopping eating for a SHORT period of time to get rid of the feeling of hunger? I've
            |had emotional eating disorder since I was a little kid, &amp; I am literally always starving. Always. I've eaten to
            |the point where I was dry heavy I was so full, &amp; still the moment I stopped I felt hungry &amp; would go back t
            | eating. While I have slightly more control over it now, it's still a huge part of my life. It makes me unable to d
            | things I need to do because I feel like a slave to a hunger that rests only in my head. ////At this point (I've be
            |n fighting this for the last 10 years) I'm at the end of my wits. I'm looking into hypnosis now, but if that doesn'
            | work the next step for me is some kind of reverse-psychology crap to train my mind to associate food with fear, pa
            |n, &amp; disgust by inflicting such things on myself whenever I eat. Obviously this is not what I want to do, but I
            |really am at the end of my rope here. I will try anything. If I could not eat for a couple weeks &amp; get rid of m
            | sensation of hunger, I really think this would be a much more healthy alternative than self-inflicted pain/fear, b
            |t I'd like to hear your thoughts. 


            |This happened when i started college, at home i would be hungry for dinner and all my other meals but now im not ev
            |r hungry, i still eat though but not as much.


            |That hunger feeling is a real pain. It is one of the hardest things to overcome in this process. In your case I ima
            |ine far worse then mine because you were actually starving (my process wasn't near as extreme as yours) but I const
            |ntly had to remind myself I'm not actually hungry, my stomach is empty. My stomach being empty used to be the bigge
            |t reason I'd eat. So I'd be eating at all times of the day and binging on junk just before bed.////I cut the bad st
            |ff (chips, carbonated drinks, fast food, processed food, etc) and forced myself onto a strict routine of measuring 
            |ood and eating far less then I was used to (1300 or so cals a day compared to 2500+) and never taking seconds. When
            |I did succumb to a late night snack it was vegetables usually but at the worst very lightly buttered popcorn (1/4 c
            |p) and of course not prepackaged trash, popping kernels.////I would condone my diet because it wasn't unhealthy. I 
            |as still getting my proper nutrition through food intake but I was consuming less then i burned in a day. I slowly 
            |ncreased my food intake as my body became accustomed and was able to bump my intake cals up to around 2100 and not 
            |ain weight.


            |Definitely not weird about the music thing. There are many songs that trigger powerful emotional and physical emoti
            |ns in me because I subconsciously associate them with certain parts of my life and when I listened to that music re
            |ularly. ////Some songs literally make me sick to my stomach because I listened to them when I was very ill and it t
            |iggers that feeling when I hear it again. The brain is crazy.


            |Did you ever get your appetite back?  Or will you in time?  I've been suffering from an eating disorder for years n
            |w.  I smoke pot and hash all day but I can't choke down any food until I'm practically throwing up from having an e
            |pty stomach, and even then it's just Hell having to nourish my god damned body day after day.  ////Unless I'm enjoy
            |ng some real gourmet shit on a special occasion, I just dread the thought of eating.  I used to think I was skinny 
            |ecause I have a fast metabolism, until I realized most people eat twice as much as I do.  I eat probably 1,000 calo
            |ies a day.  My body will probably be underweight until I die and it needs to be cremated.  


            |I've slowly learned to ignore this, not that the level that you had to endure. But often while alpine climbing I ha
            |en't eaten in 16hours of high activity in the mountains and still have to get back to camp or out. It still sucks t
            |ough. How bad was the pain?


        |Depends on the person, for me it's a day or two depending on previous eating habits.

            |I'm confused then, how did you lose weight without pooing? The mass had to go somewhere and there's no way you just
            |sweat off a few hundred pounds.////I want to clarify, I'm not challenging you or anything. I'm just curious how it 
            |appened. True you may not know but you may know something I don't that explains this.

    |How did you ease yourself back into eating? And what is your eating regiment like now?


        |I started by stopping the insane restriction.  I used a calorie counting website and a scale to weigh out all of my foo
        | and shoot for 2000 calories a day.  I would only eat foods I considered "healthy", which basically meant high nutrient
        |density, low calorie.  From there, I slowly started to expand my diet to include food beyond the 20 or so I limited mys
        |lf to, then stopped weighing the amounts.////My eating regiment now is....mixed.  I don't limit myself when I am eating
        |out.  I will go to a Thai restaurant and order Pad Thai, and go Cookie Monster on the whole thing.  I avoid desserts, i
        | part because I have never been a huge dessert guy, also because I try to avoid excess sugar.////When I am not eating o
        |t (or a meal cooked by someone else), I am still somewhat restrictive.  I do a lot of chicken breast with seasoning, hu
        |mus, spinach, brocolli, fresh veggies, blueberries, etc.  One could say that I follow a "natural, organic" sort of diet
        | but I do so while being completely ambivalent towards the entire "organic" movement.////I also always have a powered p
        |otein shake mix and oatmeal nearby for when I find myself not consuming enough.  If I reach the end of the day and real
        |ze that I haven't consumed enough calories to sustain, I would make myself a protein shake to help out.


            |Peanut butter and milk (with protein) before bed is godly when you realize that you're short of calories. Give that
            |a shot :D


                |I definitely will!  I use almond milk in my shakes, and peanut butter would be a great source of some extra hea
                |thy fats and protein.  Thanks!


                    |Protein shakes with almond milk is so awesome! Adds so much more flavor imo. Gotta love the quickness of do
                    |ning a protein shake.


                    |I use almond milk and peanut butter in my shakes with damn near everything else I want to eat for dinner - 
                    |t's heaven because I hate the chore of eating.


                    |Make sure to use all natural peanut butter, where peanuts are the only ingredient. Regular peanut butter is
                    |loaded with sugar.


                    |Almond milk shakes with almond butter FTW.  Once you find a place to get fresh almond better you'll never w

                |Add a banana in there with the milk and peanut butter and you will be amazed you thought the original shake was
                |good. Bananas make it soooo much better.

    |How much money do you think you saved not buying food?


        |Insane amounts of money.  I have never had such freedom to spend in my life.  Not only did I go from spending a normal 
        |aters amount to nothing, but I went from being a guy would could do two whole pizzas a night to nothing.  I probably sa
        |ed thousands of dollars.


            |Could you actually do 2 whole pizzas in a night? or was it two during the whole day and night? Also what size?////I
            |m just curious cuz I'm roughly the same size as you were, height and everything. 


                |I would demolish two pizzas over the course of probably 48 hours.  Two large pizzas.  I would eat in binges.


                    |Yup, sounds like me. ////Food is a gift and a curse. 


                    |48 hours is a long time, sounds like college living days


                    |I'm an average twenty something and that's easy 


                    |Damn, that's a lot of pizza.  I'm kinda heavy, but that would be overkill for me.  In a meal, two slices is
                    |good for me; three is a treat; and four is pushing it.  If I were to eat 3-4 for dinner, I would probably n
                    |t eat breakfast the next day (simply out of not being hungry).

        |You're right, it's not anorexia, but I find trying to call it "Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified Most Resembling

        | much to be considered anorexic, yet we suffer from the symptoms, practice the restriction, etc.////I weighed too much 
        |o be diagnosed as anorexic given I was six foot three and 170 pounds, but as much as I tried to use that as an excuse t
        | cast aside the label, it's semantics.


            |I want to ask if you're doing better now but I'm not sure that's appropriate.


                |I am doing better now, because I am not restricting my intake, and I don't have such a malformed body image tha

                | undo most of these things, but it isn't a rosy picture.  I try to be realistic about this in my response.////I
                |am in a good place, and am not acting in a way that currently jeopardizes my health, hurts the people I care ab
                |ut.  By that measure, I am doing much better.


                    |This makes me glad to hear.  You are very honest and self-aware-- that's refreshing.  I hope you continue b
                    |ing in a good place.  :)


                    |Could you explain how this process affected your relationships with family and friends in as much detail as
                    |you're comfortable with?


                    |I struggled with anorexia and I feel like what people always fail to realize is that it literally tears you
                    |apart emotionally. As in,  there is dialogue back and forth in your mind between your healthy self and your
                    |eating disorder self. Yes, you realize what you are doing is unhealthy, in fact I was self conscious of how
                    |skinny I was. But at the same time I was a disgusting cow that didn't deserve to  to eat.  Food becomes an 
                    |bsession, it was really the only thing I could think about. But I couldn't eat it, definitely not. As a res
                    |lt, everything else that was once important, friends, family, school, became secondary to the eating disord
                    |r; it consumes your mind.


            |&gt;You're right, it's not anorexia, but I find trying to call it "Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified Most Res
            |mbling Anorexia" a bit cumbersome :p .////Based on behavioral symptoms, it was anorexia, though, right? Had you con
            |inued with that behavior and the mindset that elicited it, you would probably be very underweight, no?//


                |To be actually diagnosed as Anorexic has rather stringent requirements. So medically speaking it's Eating Disor
                |er Not Otherwise Specified and it's correct to call it such. ////I'm in the same boat myself as far as 'basical
                |y anorexic but technically not' and I will often just say I'm anorexic bc it's easier to understand than trying
                |to explain EDNOS to most people. It's often a personal preference as to whether that's a label that fits you wh
                |n you're in the middle ground of eating disorders, but the actual medical side is very strict. 


                    |MeloJelo - Yep, exactly.  That's the problem with the diagnosis criteria as they stand.  I was well on my w
                    |y to being the appropriate weight to be diagnosed as anorexic, but had I hit that weight....I would have be

            |But, take note, you *can* be anorexic, aside from the number on the scale.

            |I've always heard that referred to as EdNOS.//


            |Doctors need to understand that anorexia isn't about how much you weigh. An 89 pound girl can have anorexia, or a 3
            |0 pound man. That's why it's called a mental disorder. A mental disorder that can yield physical side effects.


            |i'm sorry but you are anorexic. 


                |I am aware of this, but thanks for the update none the less :) .


        |No this is pretty much anorexia


            |I mean, I'm not a doctor or anything, but yeah.


                |It's actually more along the lines of bulimia. The difference between bulimia and anorexia is whether or not th

            |It is definitely anorexia, it is just not anorexia nervosa. 


        |Yeah, I think it is. Anorexia nervose is a psychological disease, after all.


        |Anorexia is diagnosed based on being underweight and fear of gaining it. My professor for abnormal psychology was a cli
        |ical psychologist who dealt with eating disorders. I will have to ask her about what she thinks of OP's situation. 


        |Anorexia has nothing to do with what you weigh, it's about having an unrealistic body image (thinking you have a weight
        |problem when you don't) then turning to dangerous eating habits to remedy your imaginary weight problem.////It's a psyc
        |ological not a physiological issue. 


        |it is anorexia. OP may say it's not but starving yourself is anorexia. He thinks that because he isnt as thin as anorex

    |Did you feel super fast and athletic afterwards? What were some of the biggest differences you felt?

    |Did you still get intense hunger pains, even though you were surviving off your own body fat? If so, how did you have the w

        |I did get hunger pains at first, and a general stomach sickness that would present itself for hours (a sort of queasine
        |s).  As far as how I would make it through, it changed over the course of the loss.////At the start, I would go and buy
        |food, eat about half of it, then throw it away.  I purged a few times, but forcing yourself to vomit is horrible.  Afte

            |How is this any different than anorexia?


                |It's only different from anorexia in that the DSM IVTR diagnostic criteria of anorexia are needlessly restricti

            |Jesus Christ, you need serious mental help. I'm not even kidding.

            |Good job, really you demonstrated some great willpower. Last year's summer I did something similar, and the process

            |this totally sounds like an eating disorder to me...


            |I totally get this.


            |This is essentially how it started to stick for me, too. I just decided that I wanted to lose weight as "something

                | extra funny: I spent a lot of time working around psychiatrists.


                    |Those  psychiatrists should be fired!


    |Why did you decide to starve yourself rather than lose weight a healthier way? Did you accept and prepare yourself for the 
    |omplications of muscle loss and damaged organs?


        |I decided to lose weight this way because of the speed at which I could lose it, and because for me it was easier to gi
        |e up eating as a whole rather than teach myself to have a healthy attitude towards food.////I did accept and prepare my
        |elf to an extent.  I have a background in psychology and have worked with eating disorders directly, and so I am not st
        |anger to the physiological and psychological issues that go along with severe self imposed restriction.  As far as musc
        |e loss and damage to organs, it was a combination of just not caring, and telling myself that I would be lucky.////I al
        |o worked out excessively to try to "save and build muscle"....which sounded great on my starved brain, but of course is
        |absolute bullshit as you need to have protein intake to preserve and build muscle.  All I was really doing was stressin
        | my muscle and organs.


            |I bet you are getting tired of answering this fucking question. lol


    |How did you get so big in the first place? And why did you decide to lose weight? Was there a life threatening situation yo
    | found yourself in, or were you just tired of being big?  Kudos on the weight loss! 


        |What made me so big in the first place was using food as an emotional outlet.  I ate when I was bored, I ate when I was
        |sad, I ate when I needed a friend.  Slowly this turned into an obsession with food.////I decided to lose the weight for
        |a few reasons.  First, I was ultimately tired of being fat.  I had tried losing weight before with little success, and 
        |s I thought more about how this process could work, and with great speed, I was strongly encouraged.  A second reason w
        |s I wanted to improve myself physically for the relationships in my life.  I wanted to be "handsome" for women.////It's
        |not a good reason, but it is what it is.  I had a family event in the future, and I wanted to look as good for it as I 
        |ould.////There was no life threatening situation I found myself in, thankfully.  I as fortunate to be an extremely "fit
        | morbidly obese individual.  And thanks!


            |How do you feel like you've done with the second part? Is your dating life better now?////Also, did you take vitami
            |s while you were doing this?


            |Nah man, a lot of people exercise and diet just to look good.  There's no shame in it really.


            |I am so intrigued by this. That you seem to have had two opposing eating disorders... and that you apparently just 
            |onsciously chose to switch from one to the other. But it sounds like you still have trouble maintaining a healthy r
            |lationship with your food even now right?////What's underlying all this? Do you know? Is this some manifestation of
            |childhood issues? What's the link with food in particular? Now that you're trying to keep your diet healthy, does i
            | manifest itself in other ways?


    |Did you eat anything in the 11 months? Of so, what did you eat and how often?


        |Yes, I would eat.  I would fast for various periods of time; my longest continuous fast with no consumption was 8 weeks
        |////As far as what I would eat, eggs, veggies, chicken, whole wheat toast.  Minimal stuff.  Not enough to survive on.


            |Holy fuck 8 weeks without eating a single thing?  I'm not sure how you had the energy to do anything man.. it's jus

            |Wow, you look like a totally different person. Did you suffer any serious or permanent complications? 


                |Serious complications, yes.  I have had issues with my heart, kidneys, and muscle damage that has had to be rep
                |ired through surgery.////As far as permanent, fortunately it looks like everything has been temporary.  The onl

                    |Why/how were you slowed down mentally?  Is this still a problem or are you back to normal?


                        |I was slowed down mentally because I was starving my brain.  The amount of glucose needed by the brain 
                        |lone is pretty shocking, and when you're limiting your intake as a whole, things get sloppy.////I saw t

                        | taken a long, long time to recover, and in a way I am still doing so, but I have recovered.  My person

        |Nope, not medically supervised.  I went in to the doctor to tell her I was thinking about losing weight, asked some que

        | twice, once weighing around 330 pounds, once weighing around 240 pounds, and then not again until I was around 170.///
        |What made me do this was 1. Tired of being fat 2. Wanting to look good 3. Insecurity 4. Finding it easiest to just stop
        |eating overall rather than follow a healthy low input, high output eating plan.////To defeat hunger, I basically taught
        |myself to hate eating, to feel a horrendous guilt any time I did eat.  I also told myself that the ends would justify t

                |Yes, my doctor was aware.////Even though I don't know any of you and none of you will likely ever meet my docto

                |Squirrel-girl: the Man!////I can see it now.


    |How much water did you drink during your arduous journey?


        |A ton.  That is one of the positives that has come out of all of this.  Consuming water has the added benefit of making
        |you feel full, so in addition to just wanting to remain hydrated, I would drink like a beast.  I continue to do so, and
        |it's been a good thing.


    |Your muscles must have been used to holding up all of that weight. Did you feel super strong after losing so much in such a
    |short period of time? Like you could jump 10 feet high?


        |I felt extremely light.  I didn't realize how heavy I was until I had lost around 200 pounds.  Little things, like feel
        |ng as though I could float away while walking.////Actual strength, not so much.  When you lose weight this way, you are
        |'t going to be doing any favors for your strength.  If you want to lose fat while retaining muscle, you need to keep yo
        |r muscles fed.


        |Pretty sure without regular exercise his muscles would've decreased at the same rate if not faster. Bone strength on th
        | other hand would be interesting as long as he maintained a respectable supplement intake. Interesting question though 
        |'d definitely want to see the answer on this !!:-)  


    |Have you regretted your decision to lose that much weight in that little time?


        |No.  I don't regret the way that I did this, nor the speed, for any reason except one; the impact it had on the relatio
        |ships in my life.  As I became a shell of myself, I lied, mistreated, and stopped being the person I always have been t
        | my friends and family.  That's hard, and I am still trying to make up for it today.  I was lucky with dodging most of 
        |he serious health consequence bullets, and have been able to fix a lot of the underlying emotional issues that resulted
        |////I also regret it if it causes other people to think it's at all a viable option in losing weight.  It's not.


            |I can't quite get my head around this. Why did you end up lying and mistreating people? Because they wanted you to 
            |at more?


                |Yes.  I am not going to get into too many details on this because it extends beyond myself to my family and fri
                |nds, but many of them saw this coming, and I lied to them about the extent of what I was doing.  Wearing baggy,
                |oversized clothes can go a long way in hiding how much weight you have really lost.////It also comes from the o
                |erall "mental slowdown" that happens.  You find yourself more easily agitated, more likely to ignore, more appr
                |hensive and paranoid.  All of these things do bad things in a relationship.


                |Probably.  I mean...if one of your friends or family members just stopped eating altogether, wouldn't you be qu
                |te concerned and try yo convince them otherwise?


                    |Absolutely.  Any time someone in my family would bring up "I want to lose weight, and I have looked at how 
                    |ou've been doing" I would immediately stop them and have a quick "come to Jesus".////It's never easy to say
                    |don't be like me, but it is always worth trying.


            |&gt; As I became a shell of myself, I lied, mistreated, and stopped being the person I always have been to my frien
            |s and family. That's hard, and I am still trying to make up for it today.////I've been recovered from anorexia for 
            |bout a year and a half and this was one of the hardest parts of recovery. I feel you. Good on your for working hard
            |to make it right with those you love.////


                |Thank you for the kind words.  It's been a process, and I am glad to be having some success with it :) .


    |Did you have a 'normal' life while going through this? i.e. were you able to hold a job and do all the same stuff? If you w
    |nt to restaurants with friends/family, what was that like?


        |Yes, I was able to hold a job, and I was able to continue on working on my graduate degree.  I did go form being a stra
        |ght 4.0 student to a getting a 3.0 in a couple of classes, but that's a lot better than it could have been.////I didn't
        |do much in terms of outside activities, and severely reduced my social circle.  I have always been a chronically lonely
        |guy, and this was affected even  more by my reduced mental functioning.////Going to restaurants with my friends and fam
        |ly was strange.  I wouldn't order anything, and they would ask questions and express some general level of concern, but
        |not force anything.  I don't blame them in the least, and completely understand where they were coming from.  They were
        |concerned, but they didn't know how to respond, and to be honest I wouldn't have responded positively to someone trying
        |to intervene with my plan.


    |What is your biggest regret in the process? If you could do it again, what would you do different? 


        |My biggest regret is allowing this process to hurt my family and friends by turning me into an angry, antisocial, obses
        |ive, bitter version of myself.////If I could do it again....I would kind of do everything differently.  I would talk to
        |my doctor about interest in following an aggressive calorie restriction regimen, one that she approved and would allow 
        |or fast weight loss without threatening my health.  I would set something up with her and other medical professionals t
        | monitor my condition.////I would also realize that happiness shouldn't be tied to weight.  Losing weight didn't make m
        | happy, learning to understand myself, who I am, who I want to be, is what made me happy.  I could have done this at 43
        | pounds, and then slowly worked to improve my physical condition.////Weight matters a lot less than people think.  That
        |s what I would do differently; I would come to understand that before trying to lose any.


            |I understand what you're saying. I'm currently in the mental state you're describing, where I've tied my weight to 
            |y happiness, largely through a series of hypothetical connections: lose weight -&gt; meet girls -&gt; have girlfrie
            |d or lose weight -&gt; be more in line with fratty image -&gt; be more popular in frat. And these outcomes will sup
            |osedly make me happier. I think it's a tradeoff, really. That delusion motivates me now, but I think I might be dis
            |ppointed at the end by the fact that I'm not happier.


            |Were you always a big guy growing up and into adult hood?  I'm asking because I wasn't, then I gained a bunch of we
            |ght once I was in my 20's.  People close to me tell me that losing weight won't make me a happy person again, but I
            |really don't believe that.


    |How was the taste of your first real food after the diet? What was it?


    |Would you say you're hungry enough to eat Arby's?


        |It's funny you mention Arby's.  When I was heavy, I would go to Arby's and could down like 6 Beef and Cheddars.////I do
        |'t miss Arby's.  Not in the least.


            |Holy shit...I'm a big guy (5'10'' 250) and I've eaten my fair share of fast food...but *6* Beef and Cheddars in one
            |sitting? Damn.


    |why this method vs going to the gym and earring healthier 


        |I found it easier to give up food as a whole rather than teach myself to adhere to healthy eating behaviors.  I was the
        |kind of guy who would buy a bag of chips and think "it's okay to just eat a few", and then would inevitably lose the ba
        |tle of wills and eat the whole thing.  I found it surprisingly easy to just not buy the bag of chips, to stop eating as
        |a whole.////Going to the gym was physically hard because of my weight, and also I was embarrassed.  I also half assed m
        |st attempts at serious working out.////Speed is what did it for me.  When you start losing 10 pounds a week versus the 
        | that a healthy process allows, it's hard to argue against it when you have your mind set, whatever the negative conseq
        |ences.


            |thanks for your honest answers!

                    |I'd asked this question in the post you hijacked ;) so thanks for detailing this in the AMA. I think your o

    |Do you have a graph of your weight loss? Including the eventual weight gain once you started eating again.


        |Unfortunately no.  As I have mentioned in other responses, I did this without medical supervision, so I only have four

        |Think you mis-read. As I understood it, he's saying that people who PROMOTE anorexia as a good idea are terrible. Peopl
        | who are anorexic weren't his target.


    |How has this affected your love life? Did you have a relationship before you lost weight? Have you found someone since?


        |Yes, I had one relationship before I lost the weight.  I have always been ashamed of my physical appearance, and that h

        |z"), and that hurt as well.////Since the experience I have not had a relationship.  Part of it is working on fixing mys
        |lf, my career, all sorts of outside factors, but part of it is also a massive recalibration of "who I am".  All of the 
        |udden I have a lot more confidence, I am assertive, I have regained my passion, and I don't quite know how to direct it
        |  I also severely damaged a lot of the important relationships in my life by going on my self imposed starvation, so th

        |g to be able to take advantage of the fact that I am a new person.////And being a new person has far less to do with ho
        | I look physically as much as how I feel internally :) .

            |//How exactly? I know you mentioned your family and doctor wanting to put you in counseling when you were at a low 
            |eight, but was it just that your family and friends didn't think you taking care of yourself?


                |No.  In addition to that, I became a bit of an obsessive asshole.////I should preface this by saying the number
                |one way I am described is level headed and calm.  Not easy going so much, because I am extremely passionate and
                |assertive in my pursuit of what I want, but I am always calm, always open minded, and always there for anyone I
                |can be.////I lost this.  People would start trying to reach out to me, and instead I would turn them away.  I w
                |uld be agitated extremely quickly.  Situations where I would be a strength for someone, instead I would become 
                | liability.  Other people, I endlessly dumped my depression on.  I would harass them for not helping me, then t
                |rn them away when they tried.  I would question their friendship endlessly.////In addition to them being upset 
                |hat I would jeopardize my health, I actively behaved in a way that no one should towards people they care about
                |////I would go back to being 430 pounds before I would act that way again.


                    |Do you know for fact or have strong suspicions on why starving turned you into an obsessive asshole? I mean
                    | do you believe it has more to do with psychology (changing body is too much to deal) with or physiology (i
                    | no glucose for brains turns your crazy). It might be a combination of both? Did you have a doctor's/psy's 
                    |pinion on this change in your behaviour?


    |Former anorexic (recovering) here. This is a really really bad idea. I can tell you all kinds of ways to change/eliminate f
    |od in your diet to lose weight and just get by...but I don't, because what I did was WRONG and it seriously screwed up my h
    |alth. I will never ever have a healthy relationship with food.////In conclusion, I worry that you're telling people too muc
    |, in a far too positive way. 


        |I appreciate your concern.  That's something that weighs on me, and I am hopeful that the takeaway message here is how 
        |hitty of an idea this is.  This all started from me commenting in a thread about a study on some dude who lost weight y
        |ars ago through starvation.  I thought it would be interesting to throw in a personal experience.////There is nothing p
        |sitive about this experience outside of "being skinny", but really, what is being skinny?  People want to be skinny bec
        |use they think it will make them happy, and it won't.


    |What made you sit back and think, "That's it. I need to do something and fix this."?


        |I didn't have the healthiest approach to it.  I basically found myself in a situation where I was extremely tired of be
        |ng fat, the insecurity that came with it about my appearance, a desire to look good and to "impress the ladies", and an
        |obsessive motivation to starve myself.


    |Crazy results.  I've found this very interesting!//Did you ever force yourself to throw up in order to lose more weight?  O
    | did you just strictly starve yourself?  Also, what was your average calorie intake during those 11 months?  Thanks for doi
    |g this AMA!


        |&gt;Did you ever force yourself to throw up in order to lose more weight? ////Vomitting, particularly after binging, me
        |ns you're probably bulimic, which is an eating disorder.////It's also been found to not be very effective at causing we
        |ght loss, but it is good at deteriorating your esophagus and rotting your teeth.


        |Yes, I forced myself to vomit several times over the course of a few weeks.////Purging is absolutely horrendous.  It fe
        |ls terrible, and I was never more scared for my heart safety than after I had purged.  I gave it up quickly, because fo
        | me it was a lot easier to just not eat rather than purge.////I have specified my average calorie intake elsewhere, and
        |given that teen is in your name, I am hesitant to say it again here.////My average calorie intake?  Not enough.


    |How has it affected your self esteem? Do strangers treat you differently? 


        |Woo, a social question!////Self esteem, it surprisingly didn't do much.  At first I sort of had an artificial increase 
        |n "I don't look hideous anymore", but then I slowly realized that I still hated my body.  That hadn't changed, even bei
        |g 230 pounds lighter.////My self esteem is now way higher than it's ever been, but that has come independently from the
        |weight loss.  It came with having confidence in myself as an intelligent, free thinking, open minded, passionate dude. 
        |I could have been that at 430 pounds just as easily as I am it at 170 pounds.////Yes, strangers are generally nicer to 
        |e.  People smile at me far more, are inclined to carry on a conversation longer.  It's an unfortunate reality of the wo
        |ld we live in; people who are overweight have weight tied to character, and that's an absolute crime.


    |Serious question: at the beginning of the summer I got a job that keeps me pretty busy throughout the day. I started to ski
    | lunch so I could continue working and make more money. Then eventually I started to skip breakfast so I could show up to w
    |rk earlier. Now im at a point where I literally have no appetite, I only eat one very small meal at night after I get home 
    |rom work, and rarely ever get hungry so anytime I eat I feel like im forcing food down my throat. I weighed just over 200lb
    | at the beginning of the summer, last week I stepped on a scale for the first time in who knows how long and I weighed 173l
    |s. My weight loss is clearly due to my lack of appetite. I used to be the type of guy who could knock out an entire pizza t
    | myself if I really wanted, now I have trouble finishing a single slice.////So my questions: did you have any similar probl
    |ms when you started eating again?////Any tips I can use to "kickstart" my appetite?////Thanks


    |Did you research the consequences of what happens when you put a body through starvation? 


    |What has changed in your life since you lost so many pounds?


    |I don't really have a question, I just want to give you a virtual hug. I'm a 4'11" female that recently lost just over 100 
    |ounds. Nowhere near what you have done, but it was so... comforting seems the right word, to read your thoughts. You really
    |nailed the huge range of emotions. I wear a small in everything now, and still start browsing in the XL and up sizes.  All 
    |he extra skin is a pain, and I seriously don't know how I'll ever handle it if a relationship gets serious. But I feel guil
    |y if I ever have a negative thought about it, because I need to be so thankful I'm alive without health issues, and not ove
    |weight. I feel so thankful I'm not overweight.//Just *thank you* for being so open about this, the good bad and ugly! :) I 
    |ope everything goes smooth for you, you look simply amazing.


    |Were you seeing a therapist at the time? Have you seen one since?


    |How hard was it to just not eat?////Did you ever have "binges" where you would just pig out and purge like someone with ano
    |exia?////Do you have problems with eating now/ did you when you began to eat again?//


        |To expand, Did you ever feint?  //I find it amazing you had the energy to work out after such a prolonged extreme restr
        |ction.  I feel sort of hypoglycemic after just 24-36 hours of fasting, were you just light headed all the time?


    |Define starvation... did you stop eating entirely, it did you go down to find insanely low caloric intake like 800 calories
    |a day?////If the former, did you have to take nutrient supplements?


    |just curious, you must have had a BMR of 3000+ calories back when you were a big guy, why cut out eating altogether instead
    |of say cutting back to 1000 calories a day or something? you still would have been losing 1/2 pound a day or so, in a much 
    |afer and easier way than literally starving 


    |Just wanted to say congrats! You seem happy and that's what matters.


    |Approximately: what was your daily caloric intake before and after the process? Great AMA btw.


    |Did you poop?


    |Do you think that this is less or more healthy than staying at the weight you were at for the rest of your life? Or going o
    | the path you were on (possibly gaining weight?)
