Amazing whiteboard handwriting (x-post /r/penmanshipporn)(/r//r/Pics)




    |Holy neatness, whiteboard! I want to see huge mathematical equations written out in this beautiful handwriting.. ////*unzip
    | pants*


        |I can't write on whiteboards.  As I write, I erase it unintentionally.  Sometimes being left-handed sucks.  :-(


            |Speaking as a teacher who writes on whiteboards all day long, it's all about how you hold the pen. I'm a rightie, b
            |t it's the same thing that helps prevent my palms from turning black by 11 am. You hold the pen so your hand doesn'
            | touch the board, and so your pointer finger uses all the power for down strikes in a pushing motion, rather than a
            |y pulling motions. 


            |As a left-handed person, I find it strangely easy to write on a whiteboard right-handed... a discovery found due to
            |the immense frustration affected by the the inescapable, persistent hand smudge.


                |I drew this neat picture on a chalkboard once. I finished and then did something with my left hand. That was ab
                |ut when I realized I had the chalk in my right hand. ////I am also left-handed. My right hand is useless for wr
                |ting.  I think it's different on a board because most of the motion is in the arm and shoulder instead of the w
                |ist. 


            |I know that feel, bro. :(


                |THAT'S why as a lefty, I learned to masterbate with my right. 


                    |One of the few advantages of masturbating left handed is the ability to fap and browse at the same time.


                    |... so you wouldn't erase your penis?


            |I'm a high school teacher and am thankful for my smartboard now more than ever. It's seriously the best invention f
            |r me. 


                |I remember those.  They are really nifty.  The lag in writing always threw me off a bit, but that will only imp
                |ove with time.  I'm sure you're used to it also.

                |Haha oh I think I might fancy me one of those.

            |excuse me while i go change my pants. 


            |"Good nig"


            |What sort of pen are they using in the second and third images?  I really want one...


                |Calligraphy pen


                |They are nicknamed "wet noodle" fountain pens.


                    |give me some tomato sauce and I can also write with a wet noodle


                |It's a calligraphy pen like someone else said. The point is angled in a way. When you write, you're supposed to
                |keep it at a specific position, so that the wide and flat points come out depending on what direction you're wr
                |ting in.////There are sharpies and stuff that can achieve a similar effect due to their point, so you've probab
                |y seen it. The key is how you hold the pen.


            |A forensic analysts worst nightmare right there.


            |Subscribed.  


            |When that said 'Good Nig' I was taken aback...I'm relieved the 'ht' followed shortly after.


                |I was disappointed.


            |Jmile?


            |I saw no equations


            |Reminds me of Neal Caffrey. 


            |This oddacious... I'm impressed. I do shit like that too, out of boredom. But, that's few more styles then I got up
            |my sleeve, and I cannot perfectly imitate signatures, either. Hail to oddacious.

            |First one just looks like shit. Others are good


                |Did you even read it.


                |Yeah it looks like 15 different people's shitty handwriting. That's the point.


                    |No it just all looks shitty. No skill just looks different. Anyone can do that


                        |I'd actually like to see you try.


                        |Go do it then and post the results on the sub. I'm sure if its so easy, you'll hit top posts too.


                            |waste of my time trying to impress some little kiddies


                        |lol

    |Teacher of mine used to do this, he'd shine a projector at the whiteboard and trace the font.


        |Very smart!


        |That is a genius recommendation for those of us with shitty writing. LTP. 


        |If it's already projected, why waste time duplicating the same text that's already being projected? Sounds redundant


            |So that you don't have to have the projector running for the whole length of time the message will be up. 


            |Because leaving the projector on at all hours would be rather silly.


            |He's practicing his handwriting, not writing on top of it during a lecture.


            |I imagine after doing it awhile, your own handwriting will start to mimic the font you're tracing. ////Awhile back 
            | started making my lowercase a's and t's resemble those in Helvetica, and people are either impressed by it or conf
            |sed to the point of asking which letter it is. ////I'd love to write in Helvetica full-time though.  At this point 
            |n time, cursive is dead unless you're signing your name. We're in the computer age, and our handwriting should adap
            | to it. If everyone wrote in a consistent typeface, the world would be a better (and more efficient) place. 


                |Except most of the time, people aren't really writing in cursive, at least not the kind your handwriting teache
                | taught you. They're simply writing more 'block' letters (Edit: actually called "uncial") and bleeding them tog
                |ther by not taking the time to fully lift a pen off the paper.////Granted, some people *do* write in true cursi
                |e script all the time, but it's often just a bastardized uncial.

                |This phrase is the refuge of the lazy.

                |If you did it really good on your first try, you are either lucky or doing it wrong.


        |It's really easy to chalk it up to some inherent physical trait or a genetic predisposition that some people have nicer
        |handwriting than you.////But the truth is that penmanship is an art. And like all art, it takes years of practice, and 
        |ttention to detail.////Notice, for example, that the writer in the OP's picture has held the tip of the marker in a hor
        |zontal position in order to achieve a somewhat calligraphic effect to his/her characters. Notice how he/she has kept th
        | [x-height](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-height) consistent across all the letters. Notice how even the spacing betwe
        |n characters has been maintained.////These are all small details that help in achieving a consistent and attractive han
        |writing set.////Also keep in mind that whoever wrote on that whiteboard was very careful, and probably took quite a bit
        |longer to write those sentences than your average person, who would be content with [whatever scrawl their marker could
        |produce.](http://i.imgur.com/NRPXHVU.jpg)////**TL;DR Some people actually take pride in their handwriting, and are will
        |ng to practice at it.**


            |In other words, if you have good handwriting it's because you value it over the time you invested in achieving it. 
            |f you have poor handwriting, it's because you value your time more than practicing to get good.


                |Yes. My handwriting has actually gotten worse over time because I found ways to write the same thing quicker/mo
                |e fluidly.


                    |So, would this explain doctor's handwriting being stereotypically worse than, say, that of a high schooler'
                    |? It's because they've found the quickest possible way to convey their name/notes?


                        |I believe it's a med school thing, lots of notes that need to be written quickly.


                            |Confirmed--law school killed my handwriting; medical school killed my brother's. We both used to ha
                            |e similar penmanship, but now we can't read each other's writing at all. Odd. 


                |So that's why doctors suck. 


            |Who's writing is that in the picture? It's so close to mine it's scary..


            |I used to have a really bad handwriting. My dad used to punish me by having me rewrite all of my notebooks. I would
            |sometimes sit at my desk until morning until all of my school notes were rewritten. If my handwriting wasn't good e
            |ough, he would tear the pages out and make me write them again. I don't even know how many times I had to do that./
            |//And guess what? As an adult, my handwriting is still complete shit and hasn't improved a notch despite many night
            | I spent sobbing at my desk rewriting that stupid shit.


        |My handwriting looks like what would happen if you put the Japanese alphabet through a blender.  I can only write in En

    |why are none of the i's dotted?!?


    |Wow... Just realized my handwriting is ugly as hell :(


    |Remember to cross your T's and ...that's all.


    |What kind of freak writes like this? I'm not even envious, it's just creepy.


    |Hate these stupid fucking subreddit names.


    |Great Penmanship, but the layout for this piece is way off--I'd bring it back to manuscript.


    |This is my gym! Berkeley?


    |who would want a 400 minute workout?


    |They can write that neat, but their drawing ability consists of a crappy stick figure?


    |as wonderful as this penmanship is, the inner graphic designer in me just wishes they would go with flush left. 


    |Achievement unlocked: Serial Killer


    |i shall show you some penmanship like this in sharpie at my local home depot


    |Wow I can't write anything that even remotely resembles English on damn graph paper...


    |I'm not sure how I feel about the lack of dots on the letter i.


    |Why does this have so many upvotes..? 


    |Must be right-handed


    |I bet they're anal retentive as fuck


    |It looks like code. I want.


    |This is the kind of obsessive perfection that I go for every time I try and write on a whiteboard.


    |No dots on the i... fail


    |Jesus that's satisfying. 


    |Of course there's a subreddit for that


    |That female AI.


    |It wouldn't look that good if I did that with my printer


    |you should post to mildly interesting!


    |I bet this involved projecting the text from a word document onto the whiteboard and tracing it...I have done this a few ti
    |es with the same effect. 


    |this should't be possible


    |So a class that will take under 7 hours to complete is generating $1600.  Even if the instructor is only making 40% of that
    | that's still nearly $100/hr to teach something that they find very easy to a small number of people.  THAT'S the amazing p
    |rt.


    |forgot to tittle the i's


    |For 2oo bucks an hour, for each signup, my handwriting would be perfect also.


    |24 Hour Fitness shout out and that is near perfection.


    |80% good marker.//20% good handwriting. 


    |That should be scanned and turned into a typeface..."Whiteboard Sans-[Tittle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tittle)". 


    |Am I the only one here who thinks this course is a complete rip off? Go for a run, do a little research and lift some weigh
    |s. Incredible. 


    |I appreciate people who don't dot their 'i's.  I don't dot mine.  Makes me feel like I'm breaking the system.


    |dat align center


    |I'm a primary teacher. This is my life's dream.


    |forgot to dot the i's


    |Those i's.


    |Amazing penmanship, horrible deal.


        |That works out to $25 for each 50 minute session. You could easily spend $100 per session for good training. 


    |Damn... $29.85/hr? Insane


    |MMMMMmmmmm [Dat Penmanship](http://imgur.com/9FEYojY)


    |[How long did that take?](http://imgur.com/qtmux4g)


    |I would love to meet the (assumingly) gorgeous creature that drafted this.


    |They just used a whiteboard printer.


    |This is a case for the penmanshipporn lady that is able to forge and overtake every handwriting she sees


        |I remember that thread! That was creepy as fuck!

        |Crossposting: it's been a thing.


    |Crossposting one of the top all time posts?////Wow.


    |Clearly the writer is NOT a lefty


    |The lack of capital letters is excruciating. 


    |This is /r/pics, not a place for you to dump whatever you find. ////And no, this does not belong in /r/funny or /r/WTF eith
    |r. 


        |&gt; A place to share photographs and pictures. ////This doesn't appear to be breaking any of the rules, and it is a pi
        |ture. It may not be the most interesting picture in the world, but some who don't subscribe to the cross-referenced sub
        |may find it interesting.////


    |r/penmanshipporn?  really?  way to drag the word porn through the mud.  that's got to be the lamest sub i've heard of.


    |I'll probably be down voted for this, but am I the only one that wonders why this is called "handwriting?"


        |I'm gonna take a stab at this one. ////You're **writing**, by using your **hand**.


            |Actually, you are **printing** using your **hand**.////Source: I teach handwriting. And I teach printing.


                |Still counts as writing.////http://www.thefreedictionary.com/write


                |That's not a valid distinction at all.


    |My OCD only permits me to see the TWO EYES THAT ARE DIFFERENT LENGTHS GOD DAMN IT.////Edit: Wow, tough crowd today. Thank g
    |odness I don't get paid to please you people.


        |You don't have OCD.


            |And thank goodness for that!
