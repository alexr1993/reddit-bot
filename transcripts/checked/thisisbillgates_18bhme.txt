|Hi, welcome to reddit!////What are your thoughts on the push against the open and free Internet that we have been seeing in the recent past
|and present (such as sopa, etc)?

    |ID: c8dboom, Author: FFUUUUU
    |I'd love to know what Bill thinks about The Pirate Bay also.

        |ID: c8dbx3m, Author: Linelor
        |Bill was one of the first to write against the copying of software, all the way back in 1976.////[Open Letter to Hobbyists](http://
        |n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists)

        |ID: c8dc0vm, Author: selflessGene
        |The piratebay is a platform to facilitate the use (without paying) of many of the products Microsoft and other software companies c
        |eate.  With Microsoft's business model, which primarily sells to computer manufacturers and institutions, it's probably not affecti
        |g them too much.  But seeing people use your shit without authorization is usually not welcome.////I'd guess he's not a big fan.

        |ID: c8dbu0g, Author: herenot
        |I'm pretty sure he didn't chage his mind since this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists

        |ID: c8dbtmc, Author: herhusk33t
        |And if he's ever used it. That would be fantastic!

        |ID: c8dd68n, Author: doswillrule
        |He once said in a lecture with Warren Buffett that piracy had been partly beneficial to Microsoft, as people downloading their soft
        |are in developing markets were more likely to buy it later. To paraphrase, "I'd rather they stole our software than someone else's.

        |ID: c8ddm1i, Author: syndikat
        |And what would his solution be towards online distribution. 

        |ID: c8dh1dv, Author: HCUKRI
        |He thinks that it is a divisive subject and doesn't want anyone to be annoyed with him.

        |ID: c8djco3, Author: OsterGuard
        |Then ask him.

        |ID: c8dkcp8, Author: PsychoHouseFly
        |Me too!! Or just peoples right to trade digital goods over the internet in our giant free digital garage sail. Should it be somethi
        |g the government can regulate and incriminate/incarcerate the average joe for downloading an album or a piece of hacked/legitimate 
        |oftware. Where do you draw the line or do you draw one at all?

    |ID: c8dcpjm, Author: thisisbillgates
    |There are two things this could reference. One is the free/pay for software mix. The Internet has benefited from having lots of free st
    |ff and lots of commercial software. It has been interesting see people inventing hybrid models. Even stuff that is pretty commercial of
    |en has free versions for some audiences.  Even the most open stuff often have services people choose to pay for.////The second thing is
    |the anonymous versus identified tension. This is another one where both will probably thrive since you want anonymity for some things a
    |d full identity for others. I am surprised how little progress has been made in the identity space but it will improve.////

        |Who's buying gold for Bill Gates.... 

        |ID: c8dd782, Author: karbonaceous
        |to whomever gave bill gates reddit gold, think about what you've done for a second.

        |ID: c8dcq2p, Author: hectato
        |Great answer, and punctual as hell. Finally 10:45 means 10:45! Thanks a lot Bill :D

        |ID: c8dcrl6, Author: ambral
        |&gt; I am surprised how little progress has been made in the identity space but it will improve.////Could you please elaborate, Mr.
        |Gates?

        |ID: c8dd44h, Author: constipated_HELP
        |I don't know why we upvoted such a softball of a question, but we did. So your answer "it's been interesting, and I'm surprised" is
        |hardly unexpected.// //That being said, I think what people here would like to hear from you is some commentary on the following://
        |/- What do you have to say about the private sector pushing for closed internet for the purpose of cornering markets for profit? //
        |/- Do their arguments have any merit?////- Do you sympathize more strongly with these organizations or with people behind movements
        |like the anti-sopa movement?////- Is free and open internet worth it even though it could be considered "soft on piracy?"

        |ID: c8ddb3r, Author: fahadius
        |I'm more confused that someone bought him gold...

        |ID: c8djom7, Author: carramrod13
        |Who gave BILL GATES six months of reddit gold? Ive been trying for so long to get one measly month! 

        |ID: c8dcrnp, Author: gravesville
        |That...didn't really answer anything.

        |ID: c8dd7gh, Author: DoctorBroccoli
        |Who the hell gives reddit gold to Bill Gates!? Talk about a man who doesn't need charity...

        |ID: c8dcsvu, Author: jooshbro
        |But what about the governmental/legal component?  Do you forsee a future where our activities online can be monitored and restricte
        | for the public good, or do you support a more hands-off future for the internet?

        |ID: c8dd98e, Author: TheAmericans
        |Really? People are buying *Bill Gates* reddit gold?

        |ID: c8dcu2n, Author: derleek
        |I do believe the question is talking about free as in liberty, not free as in free to pay.

        |ID: c8dcw0h, Author: CUNT_RAVAGER
        |The system we have going now for free2play/commercial hybrid is the best choice I feel for software. Having open/free yet somewhat 
        |tripped down versions of software is beneficial for those who can't afford but may  need the software. ////Anonymity is important f
        |r people though, and it should remain an option for most things unless personal information is needed for purchasing things and wha
        |not.

        |ID: c8dcx44, Author: MenlaOfTheBody
        |Did you pay for WinZip?

        |ID: c8dcy8j, Author: ChrissiQ
        |Bill, I think what they are referring to is an internet which is fairly unrestricted; not governed by any particular country's gove
        |nment, such that if content which is hosted in a country where that it is legal is being shared on the internet (to countries where
        |it may be illegal), the countries where the content is illegal will not be able to pursue action against the host, because the cont
        |nt is legal in the jurisdiction in which it is hosted.////We have seen this problem where the USA is able to pursue action against 
        |ontent that is illegal in the USA, but originating in other countries where it may be legal to host.////It may be illegal to downlo
        |d the content into the USA, but that would be its own problem if/when it comes about, and the fault of the downloader, not the host
        |  The host cannot be blamed for the actions of those who import their content to other countries.

        |me computing, making it viable and easy for the layman heck for anyone to have an affordable home computer. I Also respect you for 
        |ll of your charity work. You are truly an amazing person as is your wife. Thank you so much for doing this AMA.////??Question: With
        |the security that has been placed on software to make it harder to pirate, are you worried about how that also affects the consumer
        | who purchase it legally? I recently got Fable3 for PC and went through 2 WEEKS of rigamarole to play it because the key inside the
        |case was messed up and the store refused to take it back because it was open. They kept claiming I needed xbox support and I cant a
        |ford one so I do not have one, though the version I got was for the pc it was a major hassle. I also had issue just last week with 
        |einstalling my office 2k on my new laptop because it had been installed on another 2 i have owned that have tanked. I understand th
        | need for the companies to protect themselves but I am poor and I am disabled and can not afford much so I save and get what I can 
        |hen I can. Making it harder on the consumer is hurting your customers. Do you have any thoughts on that.////Other than that, I woul
        | like to say you are one of my idols, not just for your success but for what you have used it for in your charity work. That speaks
        |as to what kind of man and person you are over all and that my good man is to be admired so thank you for everything.////??Question
        | What would you say is your greatest achievement aside from your children and wife. I know family is usually what is the answer but
        |I want to know your non family greatest achievement. (If its your charity, what in particular about it, how many you have helped or
