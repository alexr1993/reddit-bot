    |She being assaulted by a man in a bird suit yet is able to keep her bottled water perfectly stable. That takes some serious
    |skill

            |YOU TALKING ABOUT PRACTICE?????!!!!!


                |Not a game


                    |But practice


                        |We talking about practice.

            |makes perfkiss?////EDIT: I'm just tryin' to tell some jokes man


                |That was terrble.


                    |Honestly one of the worst puns I've ever seen.


                |Reddit takes its puns quite seriously.


        |could be a woman in a birdsuit!


            |Could be a man in a woman suit in a bird suit!


                |Could be a woman in a man suit in a woman suit in a bird suit!


                    |Why are you wearing that stupid bunny suit?


                    |Could be a horse in a woman suit in a man suit in a woman suit in a bird suit!


                        |We all know the horse was a broom all along. Case closed. Who wants lunch?


                            |Honestly Diane, I am surprised.


                    |Could be a bird in a woman suit in a man suit in a woman suit in a bird suit!


                |Buffalo Bill?


            |Why are you always on about women, Stan?


            |Could be a bird in a woman suit.


        |Because the "assault" was probably not at all violent. He just engulfed her face, didn't tackle her to the floor or pus
        | her or anything.


            |Yeah he just engulfed her face. Not like it was violent or anything. I get my face engulfed all day.


                |That's basically "eating" a baby with a puppet. If you call that assault, that must be your honest opinion.


            |come on now, watch the gif. She's pushed back over the chair.. 


        |She must have the blood of a Dane... They can dance drunk like crazy at a discotheque, without dropping a single drop o
        | beer. U NO Spill precious Beer!


        |I bet she could fall on her ass and not spill that water - if she has that skill, she could do it. We will never know..


        |Hopefully the women brings a lawsuit again the basketball team just because it's a fucking mascot doesn't give it the r
        |ght to grab the women like that. The fact that you guys think this is funny makes me sick to my stomach. She probably j
        |st wanted to enjoy the game and this fucker ruins it for her... sometimes I'm happy I'm a dude so I don't have to deal 
        |ith all the indecent men in this world 


    |The look on the face of the lady next to her (possibly her mother?) is that of pure joy.


        |My god, looking at her face made me myself burst out laughing.


            |&gt;me myself////What are you, in 3rd grade? It's me, myself and I.


                |Someone has a wet diaper...

                    |Don't bring OP into this


                |[deleted]


                    |Explain?!


                |He/she is surely not a native English speaker.


                    |Or they were going to type one thing, change their mind and backspaced, and an artifact of a thought not ha
                    | was left behind.


                    |Except it still clearly makes sense...


                    |I felt like the sarcasm in my comment was pretty noticeable but I guess it wasn't


                        |It's okay, I totally got it.

            |I had no idea Patrick Warburton was old enough to have done movies in the 60s.


        |black lady mother?...


            |No, white man mother.


    |Thought it was going to be that guy making out with his beer. 


        |I am glad it was not a repost.


        |I thought it was going to be that guy making out with that other guy.


        |I thought maybe it'd be the two cheerleaders who go "hmm... why not!"


    |She wanted the hawk.


        |You could tell by the way she was dressed


            |and by the way her hoop earrings were ripped from her head


                |I was thinking the same thing. ////I don't understand how people could wear such huge earrings. I would feel so
                |vulnerable. 


                    |Meh, I think it's cute.  I don't understand why people wear skinny jeans but different strokes for differen
                    | folks.


                        |I usually stroke back and to the left.

                    |You would feel vulnerable because in the case of an attack of some sort, those would either be ripped off, 
                    |r threatened to be ripped off.////Think of this though;////* Skinny jeans prevent mobility, you wouldn't be
                    |able to run//* Even if you ripped the skinny jeans, if you're wearing heels - you either run barefoot or yo
                    | again, can't run//* If you've got a large bust, and you aren't wearing a sports bra, you won't be able to 
                    |un without pain in your chest (or holding in your tits)////I'm sure theres a study about it somewhere, but 
                    |he more vulnerable a woman makes herself in appearance (tight fitting clothes, heels to make dat ass more n
                    |ticeable, cleavage showing, etc) the more attractive you are to potential predators/mates.  In most other s
                    |ecies, the male has to attract the female with stylish looks, dancing skills, songs, etc.  Not the same for
                    |human animals.


                    |same here but im a boy

        |I fail to see how this is funny, a young, dare I say it black woman is being sexually assaulted in what 'she' thinks is
        |a safe place. She probably gets sexually assaulted often from where she is from, and to me this is quite frankly distur
        |ing.


            |Nice way of being subtly racist.


                |*^^^^^audibly ^^^^^groans* ////oh shut up.


            |Can't tell if sarcasm..

            |e someone gets sexually assaulted often because they are black.////Also, how is this in any way sexual assault? It'
            | a joke, and a non-threatening one at that.


            |I completely agree. The government shutdown is allowing this type of behavior to thrive


            |This isn't sexual harassment though, since it's not actually real lips. Plain old harassment maybe, if she wanted t

            |Way to go Reddit, WAY TO FUCKING GO. God damn //I'm getting sick of this site, I reckon I've wasted far to long on

            |ad. Jesus, I'm sure all the down votes are just from the R/atheism circle jerk, those who are not clever enough to

                    |Because he's the most transparent troll on the whole Internet and he doesn't want to fuck up the karma on h

    |Right on the pecker


        |Yeah man, she was really *beak*oning for that kiss.

                            |No, no... we've had a long time to come to this decision. She *is* just a cunt.

            |Looks to me like she's just playing it up. Like him drinking it is the equivalent of fucking tonsil hockey and she'
            | just like "Whoa, dude! Slow down!" I don't get where all of the hate for her is coming from, she looks amused.


                |Thank God, someone's being reasonable. All the hate she gets around here for something so innocuous makes it se
                |m like there's an awful lot of projection going on.

            |They're actors, and this is one of Reddit's favorite women to spew unfounded hate at.

            | fat ass will allow, because she's a bitch


            |It's like elementary school. You pretend the other person is gross and unattractive because you either fear rejecti
            |n from that person or you fear judgement of your peers for kissing that person.

                |So that means she should be disgusted at a guy kissing his beer?


            |Perma-bitch. 


            |The princess's moment was taken from her


                |The princess took the moment from her self 300 donuts ago. 


        |I find it funny those two bros leaned in for a second kiss.


        |Something so heart warming about a man being passionate with his drink.////Maybe one day I'll find a beverage I can car
        | for that much.


        |Dude in the gray in the second gif is wearing my (little) university's sweater.


        |Hahaha, I love the fakeout on the third one. ////If I can read facial expressions, at first she's trying to act like "o
        |, kiss cam, what a silly thing", then she feels him moving and is like "oh, wait, he's going for it! yay!" which then t
        |rns to "wtf. You chose it over me?!??!"


        |Damn dude I really do see you every where. Is this your job? Btw hale shomah khoobe?


        |Nope, OPs is still better. 


        |Those are all fake though.////EDIT: Seriously. I used to work at an arena. There were at least 3 fake kiss cam videos t
        |at would run. The only one that I think could be real is the first one.


    |This was the most exciting thing that happened in Atlanta that season.


    |The best part of this is that the mascots mouth is where the person inside is able to see, so they must have had a couple o
    | seconds of incredibly awkward eye contact


    |Meanwhile I can't help but wonder if those huge earrings got caught in the beak.


    |Did not expect to look in the background and see someone in a vintage Bruins jersey at a Hawks game


        |I was pleasantly surprised


        |Welcome to Atlanta, where fans wear whatever they heck they feel like wearing to sporting events. I was at the NLDS gam
        | Friday night (braves v dodgers) , there was a guy wearing a Pierce celtics jersey.

        |Goddamn he's so smooth.  The leader of my country is a robot.


    |Reminds me of how an ex used to kiss. Looked and felt like He was trying to swallow me whole. Saliva too. 


        |&gt;He////If my ex was God, I'd be scared for my life.////


            |"Yeah, I dated God once. He was such a control freak. And I could never keep anything from him. I'm never dating a

    |Hey little baby bird, here are some partially digested worms!


    |Whoa, easy with the tonsil hockey you crazy kids.


    |That's a little scary. Won't lie.


    |The best kiss kam//


    |Super hot


    |That looks like it hurt.


    |Yesterday I learned this is how you give CPR to a baby.

    |The best jerry, the best!


    |Impressed that Hawks management allowed this.


    |Oh man... you do not mess with a black woman's hair.  She is not pleased on the inside.


    |This is one of the few things that actually made me laugh rather than blowing air out of my nose a little more harshly than
    |usual. 


    |That bird ought to check his privilege! 


    |Guy in the back: "I've seen better..."


    |He got some but I guarantee he fails in the clutch


    |So, Mr. Hawk...do you swallow?////Er, that's not what I meant.


    |Did she died?


    |Why is this massive gif not a fucking video?!

    |Go Hawks!


    |it's pretty great but this is still my favorite kiss cam moment ever: ////http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnvpP2hN_u4////


    |I love kiss cams so much sometimes. My fiancé went to the game with another woman one day (one of our close friends) as I a
    | stuck in a wheel chair right now, and I was hoping so much that they'd get on the kiss cam. It would have been so hilariou
    |ly awkward. 


        |Why are you in a chair? Cerebral palsy? 


    |Is this... Seattle University's Red Hawk?


        |The Atlanta Hawk's hawk


    |Ignore this post://///r/DotA2


    |The face on the black guy on the left, he looks so much like Ainsley Harriott.


    |Rather looks like "OMNOMNMOMNMOMNMOMNOM"

        |No way this was staged. That lady is obviously on her first date with the giant bird. 


    |Can you imagine the stench of that costume?


        |There's usually like a little fan in there that gets some circulation in there. Don't get me wrong you're usually prett
        | soaked when you get out, but its probably not as bad as you're imagining.////Source: I was the mascot for my college b

    |I think this kiss cam thing is completely stupid.

    |Well, I'm not sure what she expected.
