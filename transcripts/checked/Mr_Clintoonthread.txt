Why do radioactive elements still exist? Shouldn't all matter have decayed to a stable isotope by now, 14 billion years after the big bang?(/r/AskScience: Got Questions? Get Answers.)




    |No radioactive isotopes were produced in the Big Bang at all. The BB produced only hydrogen, helium, and very small amounts
    |of Lithium and Beryllium. ////Radioactive isotopes are created primarily in supernovae. The ones in our solar system were a
    |most certainly generated by a nearby supernova that exploded prior to its formation.


        |We have strong evidence that short lived radionuclides were active during the early part of the solar system; ie, Al-26
        |has a half-life of 700,000 years.  The fact that we find minerals that have Mg-26, the decay product, in them demonstra
        |es that the minerals formed with Al-26.  There are many such examples.  Because these short-lived nuclides were present
        |in the early solar system, it is strong evidence that the products of a supernova strongly affected the original materi
        |ls of our solar system (although the specifics are debated a bit), because there is no other way that the nuclides coul
        | be present.  So, the long-lived radionuclides, such as Uranium isotopes, are the same age as our solar system, not our
        |universe, because they were also generated 4.567 billion years ago.  


            |There is absolutely no evidence for a supernova to have happened anywhere within several hundred million years of s
            |lar system formation. The idea itself had been very popular in particular because of claimed reports of 60Fe rather
            |than 26Al. Things like 26Al can be produced in the winds of stars (such as Wolf-Rayet Stars) and so do not definiti
            |ely point to a supernova.////However it is tough to make 60Fe outside of a supernova so finding an excess over the 
            |nterstellar medium would be definitive proof of a supernova occurring very close to solar system formation. However
            | the reports of the existence of excess 60Fe were incorrect and almost all of them have been correct downward to a 
            |ull result (and if you closely examine the rest of the data then the evidence for 60Fe is very sketchy).////TL/DR: 
            |here wasn't a supernova within hundreds of millions of years of solar system formation and short lived nuclides pro
            |ably came from winds of other stars


                |Yeah, a lot of the confusion here is from people constantly being assaulted with "***Everything is made in supe

                    |This is where the debate gets a bit confusing and I'm going to try to clear it up. There are two times in t
                    |e history of the solar system that people want to invoke supernovae. The first is right as the solar system
                    |is forming (as written by /u/mineralfellow) and the second would be much earlier while the material is stil
                    | floating around and the solar system has not yet formed.////So we have two distinct things to deal with: 1
                    | Did a supernova occur as the solar system was forming (what /u/mineralfellow wrote) and 2) Did supernovae 
                    |roduce materials that eventually ended up in our solar system.//////The answer to question 1 is: No. A supe
                    |nova that close to the origin of solar system would have injected a lot of 60Fe and we find no evidence of

            |Wow that's very interesting, so all the heavy elements we see in the world today (e.g. my iron doorknob) were produ
            |ed in the same supernova? 


                |Iron is the end point of a star's life, it's the heaviest atom that will release energy during fusion (as it's 
                |he most stable/lowest binding energy per nucleon), so it was likely produced in an active star.

                    |owed by Iron-58 and Iron-56.


                        |Binding energy is negative, so lowest.  //You are correct, I had been taught Iron but apparently that's
                        |a common misconception.


                            |[NNDC](http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/) uses a positive convention (look at BE/A), because it's thou

                            |the nuclear binding energy page, and the numbers are positive. When physicists refer to the binding
                            |energy of these nuclei, they use the word highest, not lowest.


                            |Right, but almost all online resources use a positive convention, so for /r/askscience purposes I'd

            |CAN you explain the whole idea of half-life to me please? What does it mean by "decay"? I thought matter couldnt be
            |created or destroyed... wouldn't the decayed part still be uranium or aluminum?


                |Half-Life: Atomic decay is a random process. Any atom of a radioactive element is equally likely to undergo a d
                |cay process at any given moment. The half life is the duration required for half of the atoms in a sample of a 
                |articular isotope of an element to have decayed (an isotope is particular variant of an element with a specific
                |mass (the same element can come in one of a number of masses - some of which may be radioactive and some not)).
                |////Conservation of matter is a rule of thumb that doesn't apply in quite such as straightforward manner when (
                |mongst other things) nuclear reactions occur. What makes an element an element is the number of protons it has 
                |nd if it undergoes a decay process that changes this number then it generates a daughter that is a different el
                |ment. At the same time a tiny bit of the mass can be converted in to energy (where the energy in nuclear fissio
                |/fusion comes from). It is also possible for the mass of an element to change without the element changing (eg 
                |-2 can decay to H-1 both are hydrogen but the mass is different).   ////


                    |But what does "decay" mean? Does that atom just cease to exist?


                        |The simplest way to think about it is that the atom loses a bit of itself, which is released as radiati
                        |n and energy.  The original atom may become a different element depending on what was lost, and the rad
                        |ation is emitted into the surrounding area.


                            |A tad off topic but since the topic of mass not being created /destroyed comes up:////When matter c
                            |nverts to energy, doesn't that mean that your losing matter? Or somewhere along the line does the e

                        |No, it means split up. For example, the simplest type would be for a nucleus to split, generally spitti
                        |g out a helium nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons). This leaves you with a molecule of helium and a mole
                        |ule of the element two atomic numbers lower than what you started with. ////For example, plutonium (94 
                        |rotons) will decay into uranium (92 protons) this way. Because decaying elements start at a higher ener
                        |y state than the combined energy of the resultant products some energy is released all by its lonesome,
                        |and that energy is what is harnessed for nuclear power. ////Uranium can then decay again into thorium (
                        |0 protons), and so on. ////There are other types of decay as well, where protons split up into a positr
                        |n and a neutron, or a neutron into an electron and a proton, as well as gamma radiation which is, I bel
                        |eve, simply the emission of energy to reduce the energy of the atom without any transmutation from one 
                        |lement to another. ////Generally things heavier than lead are radioactive and will decay towards lead, 
                        |nd things lower than lead are generally stable.


                        |Decay just means to go from an atom of one element to an atom of another element with a lower atomic nu
                        |ber, by losing protons (and sometimes neutrons).


                            |Sometimes a decay can increase the atomic number (e.g. beta decay where C-&gt;N + e^- + anti \nu_e)


                        |Decay simply means that it loses particles. They may emit several types of particles, and depending on

                        |ctron and a neutrino and become a proton. In doing so, the atom climbs to the next slot on the periodic
                        |table. For instance, Uranium 238 may "decay" into Plutonium 239 by changing a neutron into a proton.///
                        |This process can also be reversed, the proton ejecting a positron and a neutrino to become a neutron.//
                        |/Alpha decay is when it emits a helium nucleus, or 2 protons bound to 2 neutrons. Gamma decay is when a

                        |If a nucleus is radioactive, that essentially means that it's unstable. Instability arises from having 
                        |oo many protons or neutrons, and when this happens, every so often bits of the nucleus will fly off. By
                        |doing so, the atom will eventually go to a stable state and cease being radioactive. That's decay.


                        |Decay just means parts of the atom, for lack of a better term, fall off. Atoms are made up of neutrons,

                |You've got two questions here: first, radioactive elements decay by just emitting some particles, which turns t
                |em into a different element. For example, a uranium-238 nucleus, which contains 92 protons and 146 neutrons, wi
                |l sometimes emit an alpha particle, which contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. What remains in the nucleus is, of
                |course, 90 protons and 144 neutrons, which we call thorium-234. That particular nucleus is also radioactive, an
                | it will sometimes emit a beta particle (actually an electron). The process that creates the beta particle also
                |turns a neutron into a proton, so after the emission of the beta particle, the nucleus has 91 protons and 143 n
                |utrons, which we call protactinum-234. That in turn is also radioactive, so it will sometimes decay, which mean
                | the number of protons and neutrons changes again, and so on and so on, until the process results in a number o
                | protons and neutrons which is stable (i.e. not radioactive), and then no more decays take place.////The other 
                |uestion is about half-life, and more generally when things decay. Basically, decays are random in the sense tha
                | it's impossible to predict exactly when a particular nucleus will decay, but the probability that the nucleus 
                |ecays per unit time is constant. This results in an [exponential decay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentia
                |_decay). If you were to watch a sample of radioactive nuclei, and track how many remain in their original (unde
                |ayed) form over time and make a graph of it, you would get a graph that looks like the ones shown on that Wikip
                |dia page. The thing about exponential decay is that the time it takes for the number of undecayed nuclei to dro
                | by 50% is the same no matter what time you start looking. For instance, if you start with a sample of a billio
                | U-238 nuclei, you will have to wait 4.5 billion years to find that 500 million of them are left. You'll have t
                | wait another 4.5 billion years to find that half of those, 250 million, are left. And so on.


                |Matter and energy can't be created or destroyed, but you can turn one into the other. 


                |You're right that usually matter is conserved, it cannot be created nor destroyed. ////However, we are talking 
                |bout nuclear reactions. In nuclear reactions like those that occur in atomic bombs, the sun, and in radioactive
                |decay some mass will be generated or vanish  if you carefully measure it before and after these reactions. Eins
                |eins formula E=mc^2 describes this relationship. So that little bit of mass times the square of the speed of li
                |ht means a lot of energy is released in say an atom bomb.   ////The half life refers to how long radioactive el
                |ments like uranium decay. Decay simply means under a nuclear reaction where because it either loses 2 protons a
                |d 2 neutrons (a charged helium nucleus or an alpha particle) or one of the neutrons will turn into a proton and
                |an electron the number of protons changes so you can have one element become another. A little bit of energy in

                        |articularly the number of protons makes gold behave like gold and lead like lead.  Unfortunately for th

                |Half life is a term that comes up when you're talking about certain types of decay. The type of decay in specif
                |c is one where the rate of decay is proportional to the amount of whatever you're looking at. The term 'half li
                |e' comes up in any of these situations, and another example is biological half-life (how long a substance stays
                |in the body).////Now what does it mean? Consider you have some mass of a substance that decays with time. Half 
                |ife will be how much time passes between your initial amount of mass and the time when there is only 1/2 the or
                |ginal mass left.////In an example, say you had 5 kg of material at some time t=0, and it had a half life of 2 h
                |urs. After 2 h has passed, you will have 2.5 kg left; 2 more hours later, and you have 1.25 kg; another two hou
                |s and you have 0.625 kg; and so on.////But there's still a problem you are having with "what does decay mean?" 
                |ou're right that matter can't be created nor destroyed. When something goes through a nuclear decay, the nucleu
                | changes somehow. If the atomic number of the nucleus changes, then the substance becomes something else. So it
                |might be the case that some radioactive element gives off an alpha particle, and so it becomes something with 2
                |fewer protons and 2 fewer neutrons. ////But like you said, mass has to be conserved. If you consider only mass 
                |n nuclear reactions, then you'll probably find that it's not quite conserved (it'll be close but still off). Th
                |s is where the 'famous' equation E=mc^(2) comes in. Almost everyone 'knows' the equation but doesn't know what 
                |t means; the equation is describing the notion of mass-energy equivalence. Since mass and energy are equivalent
                |, when you compute conservation of mass of a nuclear reaction, you include mass *and energy* in that calculatio
                |, and then you find that mass/energy is conserved!


                |"Half life" is the time needed for half of a sample of an isotope to decay into something else. Almost all atom
                |c nuclei have some half life, even if it's so stable that the half life is longer than the age of the universe.
                |Elements decay by "breaking up" (not entirely accurate, but sufficient for a basic explanation) into a smaller 
                |tom and a byproduct, by alpha, beta or gamma decay. Those types of decay differ in what is released during the 
                |ecay process. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/m12To4f.jpg) is a simplified chart depicting the decay chain of Uranium

                |Oh quite the contrary. Matter can be created relatively easily if you have the sufficient energies involved. MR
                |-scanner and even thunderstorms create matter/antimatter particle pairs. Even light has the potential to create

                    |I've always explained it as "making change for a dollar". The monetary amount is the same, whether you have

                    |ieces to make new amounts.


                    |but doesn't that go directly against the law of conservation of mass?//


                        |No, it is still matter, just a different configuration of electrons to protons. It becomes a different

        |It is probably worth adding, in case OP doesn't know, that radioactive decay is probabilistically measured as a "half-l
        |fe," which is the time it takes for *half* of a quantity of radioactive material to decay into ~~a stable~~ *another* e
        |ement (which might itself have a half-life, thanks PE1NUT)--and then half of the *remaining* quantity to decay, and so 
        |n.  So if you had a sufficiently large quantity of radioactive material with a sufficiently long half-life, the time fo
        | it to decay entirely would be appreciable indeed.  ////The half-life of many uranium isotopes is measured in hundreds 
        |f millions of years; assuming counterfactually that there had been an enormous quantity of uranium at the origin of the
        |universe, that quantity would only be cut in half about 2000 times (plus or minus, depending on the specific isotope). 
        |That is an exponential reduction in quantity but depending on the original amount it could still be quite a lot. ////(E
        |IT: I apologize for my bad maths--as pseudousername points out below, 2000 would likely be a sufficient number of half-
        |ifes to eliminate any amount of uranium, however as landryraccoon notes, for some isotopes of uranium, not that many ha
        |f-lives have passed.  But the central point remains that because of the way half-life works, even 14 billion years isn'
        | necessarily enough, all by itself, to decay all isotopes.  The half-life of Uranium-238 is 4.47 billion years.)////The
        |more difficult problem would actually be finding that uranium, because even in huge amounts, scattered roughly evenly a
        |ross the universe it would be almost impossible to find.  The fact that actually it forms later in stars not only expla

            |Just wanted to point out that 2000 half lives of uranium have NOT happened since the Big Bang - uranium has a half 
            |ife of 700 million - 4 billion years, so only 20 half lives or so would have happened. 2000 half lives would mean t

                |tement regarding 2000 half-lives rendering no chance that any Uranium atoms would remain. The uranium could be

        |So the Uranium buried deep in the ground on earth came from an exploding star?  Can you explain how it got from there t
        | here?


            |The star exploded, spreading its entrails through the cosmos. The different bits started attracting one another and
            |started spinning into an accretion disc. This accretion disc was what our solar system was formed from. Eventually 
            |ome clumps got big enough to start clearing a path through their orbits around the center of the disc, and as these
            |bigger clumps started to condense they started spinning faster- this is where planets get the elements that make th
            |n up and also why they rotate. 


                |To add on to this, why are minerals often found in concentrations in the earth's surface - iron rich areas in A

                |Shouldn't it be pretty evenly spread, if it all coalesced from a cloud of various dusts?


                    |Also lots of heavier element deposits come from meteorite strikes such as the Sudbury basin. [link](http://

                        | large portion of the crust that it impacted. Some part of the crust that it hit must have contained su
                        |phur and some part of it must have had somewhat elevated metal concentrations (but not necessarily a de
                        |osit itself). During the melting of the crust, sulphur was liquid within the molten rock (melt) and it 
                        |obbled up all of the available metal in the melt. Essentially, the metal that was evenly distributed (p
                        |ssibly) within the melt was concentrated with the sulphur. The sulphur was denser than the melt and it 
                        |ettled at the bottom of impact crater. It formed what geologists call a 'massive sulphide' deposit that
                        |is rich in copper, nickel, and some of the platinum group elements. The melted crust cooled over an ext

                    |layman, off the top of my head so information may need refining (which is always the best way to get someon
                    | who really knows their stuff to pile on): it's molten because the extreme pressures under thousands of kil
                    |metres of rock all pulled towards the centre of the earth by gravity cause extreme temperatures. And we can
                    |confirm its molten because of the way seismic waves propagate through the core and reflect back to the surf
                    |ce where we measure them: they could only behave the way they do because the core is not in a solid state. 
                    |lso I believe the earth's magnetic field is accounted for by the fluid dynamics of its molten core.


                        |This is very true, but another factor that a lot of people don't realize is that space is just a very p

    |Others have nailed the major answer, which is that radioactive isotopes are still being created. But I also wanted to point
    |out that some radioactive isotopes have amazingly long half-lives, with even just a single half-life approaching or exceedi
    |g the age of the universe. See [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_radioactive_isotopes_by_half-life#1024_seco
    |ds). ////Example, there's a tiny 25g bottle of depleted uranium in my lab with a 4.6 billion year half-life. At its level o
    | activity, US federal regulations state that it should still be considered radioactive for ten half-lives, i.e. for 46 bill
    |on more years. (After which point it can be legally discarded in regular waste. Though I don't think either I or the feds w
    |ll be around then to put it in the trash.)


        |Do they not consider the half-life of the decay products?  Some isotopes with relatively short half-lives decay into pr
        |ducts with very long half-lives.


            |They do, actually. Also you're required to verify it's no longer radioactive before you just chuck it in the trash 
            | you can't just say "Ten half-lives are up, I'll just assume it's safe!" ////Also the ten-half-life guideline only 
            |pplies if you had relatively little of the stuff in the first place. (my lab is limited to &lt;50 uCi per container
            | for example, and only of certain isotopes).


    |* Radioactive isotopes are produced in supernovae, which are still occurring today.//* Some radioactive isotopes have half 
    |ives of billions, even trillions of years, so we would expect some of them to hang around even after 14 billion years.


        |It's also worth noting that radioactive isotopes are also produced through the decay of other radioactive isotopes. So 
        |ome isotopes with shorter half-lives are around because they are resulting from the decay of isotopes with longer half-
        |ives.


            |Also, it is not a rule that the half-life of the decay product (if it is a radionuclide) will have a shorter half-l
            |fe than the parent radionuclide. Some decay products can have larger half-lives than their parent, such as when Nep
            |unium-240 (~1 hour half-life) decays to Plutonium-240 (6,561 year half life). See [Decay Chain](https://en.wikipedi

    |Some nuclei have extremely long lifetimes. Also radioactive elements are still being created in stars and supernovae.


        |&gt;Some nuclei have extremely long lifetimes.////In answer to the posed question, this answer implies that radioactive

                |ed, none of them were created in the Big Bang.


    |To summarize other answers:////* Radioactive nuclei are being produced contiuously in our galaxy by various astrophysical p
    |ocesses. Our Solar System inherited some from the primordial cloud it was formed from 4.5 billion years ago.//* Some of the
    |e nuclei (thorium 232, uranium 238) have half-lives of billions of years, which is why we still have some left.////To which
    |I would add: ////* These long-lived nuclei tend to decay into nuclei with shorter half-lives (hence more radioactive) sever
    |l times before reaching stability. See [decay chain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain) for examples. The radon that
    |creeps in your basement is an example of such a radioactive decay product.//


    |If someone has pointed this out, then I apologize for repeating. All radioactive elements decay at differing rates, and we 
    |re discovering that seemingly 'stable' elements are in fact radioactive, just with very long half-lives. [Bismuth](http://e
    |.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth) was recently (2003) discovered to actually be radioactive, and has a decay rate longer than th
    | age of the universe. Given enough time, we may discover a few more of these types of radioactive elements.


        |Is it possible that ALL stable isotopes are radioactive, but just with really long half-lives?  


            |The lighter "stable" isotopes are truly stable against any decay process that has ever been observed: they are forb

                    |Right, not from any of the processes that we've confirmed.////The problem is that the products of those dec
                    |ys have more mass than the parent atom.  Mass is energy, so those processes can't happen unless some outsid

            |Yes, it's even theorized that protons might be radioactive with half life's &gt; 10^43 years
