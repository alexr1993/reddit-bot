|In Russia, if you try to hail a cab, people will just pull over and offer you a ride for cheaper. Who in the right mind would get into a ra
|dom Russian persons car? Well after a few scary cab rides, I soon found out that the random Russians were the way to go. ////This is seemed
|to be the trick to enjoying Russia. Stop fearing the Russians. ////

    |What's wrong with the cabs?

        |ID: c8tx7s1, Author: zombob
        |Enforcement of taxi regulations is not a high priority in Russia. The lest reputable drivers may take a much longer route.

        |i lived in st. petersburg for a little while and twice i got extorted for more money by cab drivers. once at knifepoint.

    |I have driven in an official cab once in Moscow, when I had to entertain my co-workers (we were together on a business trip). Besides t
    |at I always taken "chastnik". My friends were in a dangerous situation once. The "taxist" pulled a gun on them, so they fled the car.

    |I've heard of this before. Basically, they pull over, then you tell them where you are going and how much you are willing to pay, right

    |ID: c8txqnw, Author: CyanocittaCristata
    |I read that in Night Watch!

    |ID: c8ty1df, Author: AmericanParty
    |You're referring to "The Peoples Taxi". Because it shouldn't be illegal to give someone a ride in your car, unlike in America. Fucking

    |Ive only ever known russians to be great and wonderful people.  Just dont cross them.

    |ID: c8ty9gb, Author: perman
    |It was the same way in China.  Cheaper too.  Don't get me wrong though it was scary the first time... especially cause I was by myself 
    |t midnight (saw a Death Cab for Cutie show in Shanghai) and spoke shit mandarin.  Took me to the wrong metro stop, cause my pronunciati
    |n was terrible.  I just figured I'd shut up and thank them.  Still got home safe.

    |In my experience the stereotype is Russian = easy money.  They have a reputation for thinking more money = better.  Typical Russian jok
    |: "Two russians in a bar.  Russian A: I paid $5,000 for that suit.  Russian B (very happy): I paid $50,000 for the same suit.". 

    |ID: c8u6zvu, Author: qwertyzxcv
    |I think it's more of a mass media induced stereotype since most movies Russians were the bad guys. 

    |ID: c8ubchk, Author: whiskeydeltatango
    |I find that rather than a specific Russian accent, a general Eastern Europe tends to suffice. I have Hungarian family members, and I ju
    |t imitate the old men, with a dash of Eugene Hutz to make it a bit more vague and ominous. The cadence is important; you have to stop i
    | odd places (to an English speaker), and throw in weird references.

    |ID: c8tx9mv, Author: Tpex
    |I call BS, Your average African mugger is not educated enough to know one foreign accent from another.

    |ID: c8tvllw, Author: run_marx_run
    |Most people in most of those places (except Europe) wouldn't recognize a russian accent. And this russians are bad guys is mainly a wes
    |ern thing.

        |ID: c8tvqho, Author: AFatDarthVader
        |Why would Africans, South Americans, or Asians (the continent in which Russia resides) not know what a Russian accent sounded like?
