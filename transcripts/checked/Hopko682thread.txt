    |Is there any quokka that doesn't smile!?

        |Quokkas strike me as very curious animals, and they seem to always have a smile, so it probably was intrigued by the le

        |a came from, lol


            |It was most likely trying to figure out if the camera was edible. They steal ALL the food!

    |Are you kidding me I have that same jacket from H&amp;M. I've seen like everybody wearing one. 


    |Hi Kahael


    |WHat if Quokkas were really the size of humans? And they would keep that look on their face as they ate us.

    |That Quokka looks SO high.


    |Honestly difficult to tell which one is supposed to be there and which one is photobombing.


    |Why are quokkas not being bred into a pet species? Syrian hamsters were down to their last pregant female iirc before being
