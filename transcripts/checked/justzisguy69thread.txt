    |3D printers are nifty toys that are absolutely useless for 99% of people.  Check back on them in 10 years.


        |Their ultimate legacy is going to be the tons of garbage they create. 


            |Look up "[lyman filament extruder](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:145500)", "[filabot](http://www.filabot.com/)",
            |"[filastruder](http://www.filastruder.com/)" and probably many others I'm forgetting.  You can not only recycle you
            | printed items into new things, you can actually recycle other garbage into prints.  Want to print something in tra

                |what seems awesome to me is that if something I print breaks (whether from bad design or years of use), I could
                |melt it down and use it to reprint another.


                    |Could I ask for another opinion on that? ( /u/7777773 ?)////How long could recycled material retain durabil
                    |ty before imperfections introduced into the mix prevent proper curing or load-bearing?


                |Last time I checked, DIY extruders are still plagued with too-large tolerances and air bubbles.  Plus the plast
                |c quality degrades every time it's re-used.//They aren't viable solutions yet.


            |Unless they can recycle stuff they made to print new stuff.

            |My analogy is that 3d printers are the new dollar store. And kickstarter is the new As Seen On TV.


            |Kind of like the useless garbage smart phones spit out. Some people find that stuff important. 


                |Yeah man, I hate having easy access to an accurate turn-by-turn GPS,  Netflix, a camera, the weather, music, co
                |ntless books, streaming radio, and the internet all in the palm of my hand. Damn smart phones.


        |Even though it's pretty new for now, it's amazing what already has been made with them. I saw a post about a house bein
        | 3D printed a few months ago.


            |Those are [industrial grade 3D printers](http://robotsinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Objet1000-printer.jpg)
            |which are already pretty good. They're huge, expensive, messy, and require a skilled technician to operate.////The 
            |ost is about [consumer grade 3D printers](http://www.lulzbot.com/sites/default/files/styles/uc_product_full/public/
            |/newimages/2012/12/Lulzbot-3D-printer-RT.jpg?itok=zSVIaKTc) for the home that are affordable and Homer Simpson can 
            |perate.


        |The problem with 3D printers isn't the printers. It's design. 3D printers are awesome at building unique, customized it
        |ms (whilst manufactured items are usually better mass-produced). To design those items however requires a solid underst
        |nding of 3D modeling and design . even an iPhone case requires mm precision to be right.////3D printing will really gai
        | traction only when designing reaches a breakthrough similar to the one smart phones had with the iPhone.////Makerbot's
        |wet dream of selling printers and design I can't see happening however.


            |I take it you've never used a 3D printer.  The problem is definitely the printer.  Even the most expensive consumer
            |models fail sporadically 50% of the time with absolutely no indication of what went wrong. sketchup and similar sof
            |ware makes it easy to be precise, that isn't the issue.


                |I'm working with a makerbot2 right now, and it's been rough trying to get a crisp non-warped model out of it so
                |far. The thing shakes quite a bit, and some features have a tendency to curl up after printing (we're thinking 
                |hat's a thermal issue, but for some reason can't file reports about it on their site). So, it does seem to be t
                |e printer most of the time. It's fine for the art department's needs so far, but my cheese dispenser is going t
                | need a redesign with Kalashnikov tolerances. 


                |Absolutely but those are manufacturing troubles relating to the Pinter. If we assume a perfect printer in a vac
                |um design would still be a problem 


                    |...but you just said 'The problem with 3D printers isn't the printer'.////Flipping your statement://If you 
                    |ssume the perfect design tools in a vacuum, you'd still need a printer that is capable of printing those de
                    |igns.


                        |My arguments is that design tools require a certain level of formation whereas sending a CAD file to a 
                        |rinter does not.


                    |I agree, at this point in time, both the printer and design skills are a problem for the ordinary consumer.
                    |Let me add material properties and finishing to that list. At the current level of maturity desktop 3d prin
                    |ers are still a gimmick.


            |Other problems include repeatability and precision that are orders of magnitude worse than in traditional manufactu
            |ing and inability to make electronic components. 


            |You have sites where people submit their models though, theres even a sex toy shop that lets you print models that 
            |hey've created, you just have 1 motor that you swap out between them. Once theres enough models, people wont need t
            | make anything, just like how it is now with many things.////Want an iPhone case? then just type in iPhone case on 
            |he site and choose one you like and hit print, no need to design anything.////I dont think the printers are easy en
            |ugh to use yet though, i always hear about them going wrong and needing loads of tweaking. Maybe a couple more year
            | will do.


            |I always thought that if 3D printers get really popular, the average person won't be doing a lot of designing, ther
            | will probably be communities to share designs or ways to buy designs from people or companies. I bet there already
            |are places where you can get designs with instructions on how to set up your printer for it.


                |[Indeed](http://www.thingiverse.com/). Just like Open Source, most people won't create it, but almost everyone 
                |ses it at some level.


            |The design isn't a problem. Not even close. When the society at large reaches a critical mass of 3D printers in hou
            |eholds, solving the design problem is as simple as propagating CAD files over the internet, originating from the sk
            |lled/trained few who possess the necessary skills.////I mean, think about regular printers. It used to be that peop
            |e needed special training and software in order to create print media - flyers, brochures, posters, covers, etc. Ov
            |r time though, we came to a point where the vast majority of households have a printer at home. In response to that
            | we now have free and readily accessible design *templates* online that you can download, open up in an office soft
            |are of your choice, add your text to the designated locations and print at will. Nobody needs to be a graphics desi
            |ner to get that done.////3D printers today are the kernel of this same process, applied to physical 3D objects. The
            |e are bleeding-edge variants of this in research fields, evolving towards tissue printers and food synthesizers. Th
            | end point here is legit sci-fi technology becoming real.////The "problem" here is certainly not design. It's very 
            |uch the printers. The technology just isn't mature enough or cheap enough to break into households. That's a hurdle
            |that can only be overcome with time. Nothing really surprising here. Almost every piece of technology in existence 
            |ight now went through the same process on their way to our every day lives.


                |The thing is tho that I don't believe that in the next 50 years 3D printing will get to a point where it will r
                |place mass manufacturing. A factory with specialized tools (or industrial sized 3D printers for that matter) wi
                |l still be more efficient, faster and more economically friendly (since there will be more recycling of the was
                |ed parts) than individual printers.////3D printers has an insurmountable advantage in personalized objects thou
                |h.////To me your argument of spreading CAD files is like having people printing their own magazines from PDF fi
                |es since they already have a printer.////We will however start seeing many 3D printers in work environment wher
                | you need spare parts on short notice from pre-made designs.


                    |I don't see printers as taking the place of mass production, at least not in their current state. I see con
                    |umer printers, especially in the years to come, as a sort of "oh shit" device. For example: "Oh shit, I tot
                    |lly misplaced the gas cap for my car, I'll just print a new one while the replacement one ships." or "I nee
                    | to use my phone for navigation while I'm on that bike expedition, I'll just print a handlebar mount".////T
                    |ose are two bad examples, but what I am trying to say is that printers will not print your next phone, or y
                    |ur shoes, or your toothbrush, but they can help you out with fixing minor day to day inconveniences. 


            |Could you clarify more what you mean by design. Are you saying we need better modeling programs or the design of th
            | printers themselves


                |Not really, it's more that a *user* needs solid design skills in order to actually make something useful. Of co
                |rse, these designs can be digitally shared once they are made, but I think a lot of people don't realize that u
                |like regular printers, you can't just get a 3d printer and "just start printing things". Those things need desi
                |ns, and there is not a widespread market of designs available to download that would be useful yet.


            |Sub mm precision actually which is really where 3D printers need to pick it up.  If you could get something with a 
            |.001 mm tolerance, you could really make them useful for small specialty parts.  


                |1/1000th mm precision is really hard to achieve for anything affordable and it's not necessary for your average
                |person who will make, say, an iPhone case or a cool looking statue.////At work, I use a 3D CNC mill that reliab
                |y has 0.01mm of precision and from what I know, anything below that requires a lot of effort (e.g. temperature 
                |nd humidity must be very consistent, tool length must be measured very precisely). This might not apply to 3D p
                |inters (I don't know much about them), but for most applications, I don't think you need that much precision.


                    |Seriously, 1 micron is crazy small. The best 3D printers have trouble doing better than 0.1 mm accuracy, an
                    | they are insanely expensive.////I'd say you can expect an order of magnitude increase in accuracy in about
                    |20 years. So unless there's a sudden breakthrough in 3D printing, we won't reach 1 micron accuracy for 30-4
                    | years, and it'll still be crazy expensive.


                |I don't think we'll ever see consumer grade 3D printers that accurate.////Even 10 microns is considered to be a
                |tight tolerance for a lot of current applications where 3D printers could be useful. (10 microns is about .0004
                |inches or about 1/4 of the diameter of the average hair.)


                    |Considering 3D printers are really only useful for rapid prototyping right now and on industrial scale, it 
                    |ill never beat cast molding, they really need to find a niche and I think trying to get the resolution and 
                    |olerances down as far as possible should be that niche.

                        |The civil aerospace industry is increasingly branching into things like topology optimization in their 
                        |eight-bearing component design. In layman's terms, this is a computational process where the outside bo
                        |ndary shape of a component is semi-fixed but the computer basically determines the best ways to punch h
                        |les on the inside of the component in order to reduce weight while simultaneously preserving the requir

                            | 3D printing remains expensive and slow for mass production of pieces.  Plain and simple.  This is 
                            |hy topology optimization, while a great use, is not the dominant market for these techniques.  If y
                            |u had to produce a 10 million widgets in a year using 3D printing, you'd find a different way.  It'
                            | just not practical at this point and that's the limitation of the technology (literally a physical
                            |limitation). 


                                |&gt;hence all the research////I'm one of those people actually doing that research. I work on t
                                |e computational side of things, doing the optimization not just for topology but aero-structura

                                |s are *currently* deployed at various scales in the industry. Yes, they're in their infancy, bu
                                | they *are* deployed. Your argument of practicality is silly when there are planes flying in th
                                | air right now with components on them that were 3D printed at an industrial scale. Nobody can 
                                |ay that the manufacturing rate can compete with traditional methods right now, but it's evident
                                |y good enough at the moment to be used in full scale production.


                |I use/sell an Asiga 3D printer at work. It is capable of 1 micron resolutions. It's great for jewelry productio
                |. 


    |I know people who have printers. They buy a consumer filament printer and just download object files to print from sites li
    |e Thingaverse. They spend a lot of time wrestling with the printer and most of the time when you ask them what they've been
    |printing they reply that their machine isn't working at the moment. They're either tinkerers who enjoy messing with machine
    | more than they do designing or even printing, or they're people with a bunch of money who bought into the hype and have an
    |expensive gadget that's now collecting dust.////I however, don't want to deal with any of that. I'd much rather learn to 3D
    |model objects and have someone else deal with the printing part. There are a few online printing shops like Shapeways and i
    |aterialize where you can just upload your 3D file and have it printed and shipped to you. If you're ultimate goal is having
    |your 3D designs produced and in your hand, this is THE WAY to go right now. You can have your designs printed at 10x the qu
    |lity of any home printer and even have them printed in materials like metals, ceramic or full color sandstone sculptures. I
    |have had many things printed and have no desire to own a 3D printer and do it myself.////Here's a couple examples of my des
    |gns I've had printed at Shapeways.//http://i.imgur.com/2WiQkh.jpg//http://i.imgur.com/jM9gaxw.png


        |I agree with you completely, but had to add that Shapeways is ruining your designs with their rules.  I regularly print
        |at home things that Shapeways claims are "impossible to print."   Their moving goalpost of unwritten design rules can b
        | mildly infuriating when you're holding the object they claim is unprintable in your hand.  There's other services with
        |less arbitrary design limitations, though they'll charge more.  iMaterialize is terrific, though they cost substantiall
        | more than Shapeways the last time I used them.


            |I don't know anything about this but as an engineer it sounds like Shapeways is trying to pack as many designs into
            |each "print" as possible. So maybe they can fit a few smaller designs in the empty space between your design, etc..
            |They also might want to ensure your object doesn't break in transit / handling and have to send you a new one.


    |One of the clothing designers on the current season of Project Runway is using a 3-D printer to create custom accessories (
    |elts, chokers etc).  Amazing use of the technology today


        |That's exactly what it should be used for to get it out there.  Things that don't need to be incredibly strong, that do
        |'t have ridiculously small tolerances but are useful in everyday settings.  


            |It's one of those things that you never knew you needed until you had one. I rent time on a printer downtown to mak
            | all kinds of little shims, hooks, holders and cases. It's incredibly empowering, but if i didn't have access to on
            |, i probably would just "make do."


                |How much to rent?


    |/r/technology (which is ironically the least technologically informed subreddit) has been hyping 3D printing as if it will 
    |evolutionize manufacturing and free people from ever having to buy anything again. I wish I was being sarcastic, but most p
    |ople on there actually think that. ////I can see them buying a 3D printer and than throwing a hissy fit when it didn't live
    |up to their unrealistic expectations, and it is good to see someone who actually understands the pros and cons of 3D printi


        |Oh god, /r/technology is one very small step above /r/politics . They should be ignored if at all possible.


        |3D printer hype is in a lot of institutions that are mildly informed: enough to know the possibilities, but nto enough 
        |o realize the complications and details of function and material costs. 


    |I was more interested in the technology used to glean 'useful consumer advice' from 7.7M comments.


    |Can we please, PLEASE just start advertising this post to high hell and for absolutely no reason at all make it the single 
    |argest post in all of reddit history, 7.7 million posts worth?


    |I feel that 7777773's comment disregards a huge part of Makerbot's motives for decisions and also isn't even close to comme
    |ting on the "state of 3D printing". More or less just a weak comment on the DIY printing market.////Firstly, Makerbot isn't
    |one of your friends garage bands, they're a company valued over $400 million. Their decisions are motivated by the goals of
    |their business which are most likely to be profitable in such a way so that they can keep producing new products. Prices ch
    |nge for many reasons. Maybe they are trying to move away from the DIY market because it can make more money in the industri
    |l market. There was probably more research into product value and maybe it was grossly undervalued. Any of these are possib
    |ities in my eyes. //Also it is unreasonable to just discount the integration of an extruder as a small change. I'm not sure
    |what some people here think goes into product design and integration but I can guarantee they didn't just buy an extruder f
    |sten it to the old design and put it on the shelf.////As for the build envelope complaints, quality can be reduced as you i
    |crease the amount of time between successive layers. This is where material optimization comes into play. For proper part f
    |rmation, bonding between layers, and so forth the amount of time between layers is crucial. ABS might solidify faster than 
    |LA and can therefore might require a smaller build envelope so that each layer fuses together and you don't just have a sta
    |k of plastic cross sections of your part at the end of your print.


    |I can never find the damn posts (mobile user)


    |My Photosmart All in One won't even work for a month before it needs fixing, fine tuning and tweaks. How are we moving into
    |3D printing before regular 2D paper printing even gets mastered? I feel like this brand new printer I bought (2013) doesn't
    |have any advantage over the first one I owned in 2001....


        |We already mastered 2D printing. It's just that HP's mid-90s laserjet department doesn't talk to the current inkjet dep
        |rtment.


    |Well, sure, with cheap printers that is true. That is why professional 3D printers cost $10k+++. They work without custom t
    |ning, and when they need to be tuned, someone else comes in and fixes it. Personally I prefer DLP photopolymer printers to 
    |he fdm machines that are popular with hobbiest crowds.And I think makerbot raised their prices because they were probably
    |losing tons of money before, and they started using much nicer components from the wood stuff.


    |I think this is the first bestof comment that doesn't have gold. 


    |I just bought the Flashforge 3D printer for 1200 dollars, a little bit more expensive then the solidoodle but a hell of a s
    |it ton cheaper then makebot. It has been a perfect machine thus far.


    |My OCD hates how there are six 7's


        |[Yeah?](http://i.imgur.com/l4qn67e.jpg)


            |You're confusing my emotions...


    |I wonder if it will be possible one day to buy a mid level 3D printer and then download the blueprints to have your mid lev
    |l 3D printer, print and build the parts for a more advanced 3D printer


        |I believe the cheaper Reprap designs are capable of printing the parts for the more advanced Repraps.  But remember, th
        |re are still plenty of parts you have to buy.


        |The parts that separate a high end 3D printer from a mid range ones will probably be ones you can never print. ////I ex
        |ect tomorrow low-end printers to be pretty good though. 


    |if this is the best reddit has to offer then this site really needs help.


        |I was not expecting to see a comment like this here.


            |It's /r/bestof , how can you not?


        |I've certainly seen much more in-depth and/or insightful posts and threads go un-bestof'ed. 


    |I want to invest in a 3D printing company, you think this would be a good idea?


        |That really depends on what type of company it is...////Regarding manufacturers 3d printing devices: There are a lot of
        |start-ups offering filament printing devices to consumers. Too many. Companies developing devices (for the consumer mar
        |et) that anticipate the lapsing of key laser sintering patents (and are compentent) might be a good oppertunity. In the
        |professional market it is hard to compete with a handfull of strong existing players, but that market will continue to 
        |row.////Regarding companies that offer services: In the world of companies that print and deliver a design there possib
        |y is room for new players. There is no clear leader. There is a lot of difference in pricing, service, quality, speed. 
        |ome regions might currently not be properly served. Regarding design libraries, no money in it. Community hates DRM and
        |is to small to monetize using ads.


    |Well they haven't even perfected inkjet printers yet and they are already making 3D printers... Of course there are going t
    | be problems.


    |3d printing needs more hype


    |A shot in the dark: does anyone here have any affiliation with the MIT media center? I went on a tour with work and saw the
    |r 3D printer. I also noticed a couch in that room that looked odd; it looked like it was printed. 


    |Misspelt title lured me into this post.


    |I just want to know what 7777774 thinks of all this.


    |I would love to know why I need a 3D printer ... that way I would have an excuse to buy one.


    |Yeah except it seems to be coming from someone who has a lot of experience with shitty printers.  Saying "but be aware that
    |no printer is hands-off. There's a lot of tuning, tweaking, fixing, and GOTO10 involved in 3D printing at the moment."  The
    |new MakerBot is pretty fucking hands off.  You put your SD card in and tell it to print.  It prints.  ////--Owner of one Re
    |Rap derivative open source printer that wants to fucking kill my soul and two MakerBots that always fucking work.


        |I still can't get my damned x2 to not rip the tape off and grind its extruders into that friggin plate. 


    |I'm convinced that a 3d printers producing other 3d printers is a kind of life, but nobody agrees with me :(


    |So a somewhat good comment in some obscure subreddit is now "bestof"?


    |Interesting...but...why is this bestof material?


    |I thought there were 7777773 comments at first lol


    |I'm glad I read this because my initial thought about 3D printing was "this would be cool", but I hadn't even considered th
    | fact that printers are total dicks about doing their job.
