Kiss of the turtle. Seychelles [900x720].(/r/EarthPorn: Mother Nature in all of her succulent beauty.)




    |been to seychelles, it is an amazing place. Best holiday I had!


        |if you don't mind my asking - how much did it cost you to go? Wife and I are planning our honeymoon and this is on the 
        |ist!


            |I've gone to the Seychelles too. Please understand that the Seychelles are a long, long way away if you are traveli
            |g from the US. Give or take a little, you are looking at a 8-10 hour flight from the US to Europe followed by anoth
            |r 8-10 hour flight to the Seychelles. From there it's another 2 intra-island hops by ferry. It is crazy beautiful b
            |t you can get similar results in Hawaii without the need to fly half way around the world. ////It may surprise you 
            |ut most people that visit the Seychelles are Europeans traveling on a budget. You can find places to stay in any pr
            |ce range and the Seychelles are served from Germany by a budget airline. I spent about $10,000 USD but I could have
            |spent as little as $2,000 for a week-long trip. ////Here is a copy/paste from a [post I did last year](http://www.r
            |ddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/16n4qr/anse_source_dargent_beach_on_the_island_of_la/c7xuua0):////&gt;I have been. I 
            |as there in June of 2012. ////&gt;**Flights**////&gt;Most US travelers visiting the Seychelles were doing a beach e
            |tension to their African safari. Two birds, one stone, and 40 to 50 hours in a plane for this once-in-a-lifetime tr
            |p. ////&gt;Most European travelers were there on a beach-only trip. Believe it or not, the Seychelles are serviced 
            |y a German budget airline: making the trip as affordable as a Mexican spring break. I too used the budget airline, 
            |ondor, and it was above average; €600 for a 10-hour round-trip flight. It's an over-night flight in both directions
            |so you get on, fall asleep, and when you wake up you are in Mahé/Frankfurt. Fan-fucking-tastic. ////&gt;There are a
            |so a handful of east-Asian and Indian visitors. They all connect via Dubai or the UAE airlines. Some European and U
            | travelers also connected via the UAE but the schedules are a bit funky. No one enjoys a 4-hour layover at 2am. As 
            | side note, almost all the fresh food on the Seychelles comes in via this route. ////&gt;****//&gt;**Islands**////&
            |t;There is 1 big island (Mahé), 1 medium sized island (Praslin), 2 small islands (La Digue (pictured in this post) 
            |nd Sainte Island, and a handful of private islands. The private islands generally have an airport/helipad and a lux
            |rious hotel (think villas, not multistory resort complexes). Some of the private islands are an hour or two away by
            |private charter plane/helicopter. A few of the private islands can be accessed by boat. None of the private islands
            |are 'affordable'. ////&gt;Mahé is a great island for people who like to explore beyond the awesome beaches and pool
            |. Rental cars are affordable (€20 per day) and easy to arrange (delivered to the hotel for day-trips or rented at t
            |e airport for everyday use). Windy roads wrap around the island cross over the center via mountain passes. If you h
            |ve issues with motion sickness, be advised, most of the roads over the island's interior are nauseating. The interi
            |r is a thick jungle with the occasional tea plantation. ////&gt;Mahé's northeast side has the big city, Victoria, a
            |d a marine park for snorkeling and exploring small uninhabited islands. The southwest side has many beautiful beach
            |s and luxurious resorts. The the northwest tip is a massive beach with many affordable hotels, beach-side resorts, 
            |nd vacation rentals. When I was there in June, the sea was calm on the northwest and wavy on the southeast. ////&gt
            |Praslin also has a mountainous interior but is considerably smaller. Aside from an old-growth jungle hike to see th
            | giant cocos de mar nuts, the beaches, reefs, and outlying islands are the things to do. There is a high-speed ferr
            |, Catcocos, that gets you to Praslin from Mahé. It takes just over an hour and can be a wet and wild ride if you op
            | for the sundeck's outdoor seating. There are also scheduled flights between Praslin and Mahé but I've never used t
            |em. Cars are available for rent at the ferry's jetty, at the airport, and at most hotels/vacation rentals. ////&gt;
            |a Digue is a cool little island. It's small enough to be crossed by bike in 20 minutes yet large enough to find des
            |rted beaches. This is the only island in the Seychelles to have those unique weathered-granite rock outcroppings (s
            |own in OP's image). While the beaches on La Digue are amongst the most scenic in the world, wave-action can make th
            | water unsafe for swimming. I believe the seas are mostly calm in May and October and you can always go the leeward
            |side of the island to get away from the waves. However, La Digue's leeward side is mostly shallow tidal pools and r
            |efs along the beachfront. The other islands have better swimming beaches but La Digue offered the best snorkeling d
            |ring our trip. Getting out to La Digue is also a journey. Day trips are offered from Mahé and Praslin but to see th
            | 2 best beaches, you'll need to stay overnight. ////&gt;The private islands are all a little different. Some (The N
            |rth Island) for example are fit only for royalty as they charge €5000 per person, per night. Others (Silhouette for
            |example) are mega resorts with 100s of personal bungalows. A few of the privet islands focus one one attraction (sc
            |ba diving, deep-sea fishing, fly fishing) but what they offer is seclusion and relaxation. You're cell phone is dam
            | sure not going to ring way out in the middle of the Indian ocean. ////&gt;****//&gt;**$$$**////&gt;The Seychelles 
            |ave a reputation for being pricey. Like all stereotypes, there's a bit of truth hidden in it. The private islands c
            |st €1000+ per night. The luxury resorts cost €500+ per night. Even some of the non-beachfront hotels can cost a few
            |hundred per night. However, there are plenty of nice and affordable places to stay too. In fact, most of the people
            |visiting the Seychelles were young families on a budget. Seafood and fruit are also cheap but anything else is impo
            |ted from a long, long way away and costs much more than normal. ////&gt;****//&gt;**tl;dr** ////&gt;*OP's image sho
            |s a beach on La Digue. It's the only island in the Seychelles to have those iconic billowing granite rocks. The lan
            |scape is like stepping into a postcard but the journey to get there is not a quick one. For me, it was a 10-hour fl
            |ght, two separate 1-hour ferries, and a 20 minute a bicycle ride. Multiply that x2 if traveling from the US.*


                |Dear, bank account.


                |Or there is a the other alternative. Have the military pay you to live there for 6 months. Best TDY I've ever h
                |d.


                |Excellent


                |I may be misunderstanding the post but why do you have to stay overnight to see the best beaches at La Digue? D
                | you have to stay overnight on that island?


                    |Sorry for the confusion. You do not need to overnight on La Digue as there are day trips ferries from Mahé 
                    |nd Praslin. However, the two best beaches are on different parts of the island and it would be pushing it t
                    | see both before the last ferry departs. ////Time flies when you are having fun. Also, the only way to get 
                    |round the island is to walk or rent a bike. As with any tropical paradise, it's hot and you'll feel more li
                    |e napping on the beach or paying in the waves than riding your bike across the island to see the other grea
                    | set of beaches. ////My recommendation would be to plan on spending 2 or more days on La Digue. It's worth 


                        |I understand now. Thanks!


                |hawaii and seychelles are very different to me. if traveling from east coast its not that much further than haw
                |ii either and to get to good spots on hawaii it takes alot of traveling as with every other world class tropica
                | island destinations. My advice would be to go to the Maldives too. Instead of ferries you take sea planes over
                |some of the most beautiful atolls in the world.

                    |waii it takes alot of traveling...////1.  Leaving from New York City, traveling to the Seychelles is [60% f
                    |rther](http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=SEZ-JFK-HNL) than Hawaii. And that isn't even taking into account that 
                    |awaii is served by non-stop flights and the Saychelles are not.//1.  *a lot


            |Us too!


            |If I may suggest, look up the Baths, Brittish Virgin Island, very similar, a lot closer if coming from the US, more
            |infrastructure.


            |It depends what you would like to do. Mahe is the main island and there are plenty of packages you can buy. You can
            |go more exclusive on one of the other islands, the more remote and smaller the population, the more expensive it ca
            | be.////Or, you can sort of backpack it. It'll cost you a bit to get there, but if you hang out at the local joints
            | head to the market and what not, and don't dine out at the fancy places every evening, you can stretch your dollar
            |and actually enjoy the fantastic locations instead.////I highly recommend hiking some of the free trails and see if
            |you can get some deals on a charter from the yacht club to one of the inner islands.////You have plenty of options.
            |You don't have to super rich to go and enjoy life there :)


        |I'm so jealous! When I was younger I was absolutely obsessed with tortoises and had this VHS recording of a documentary
        |about Seychelles that I would watch ALL the time. It's on my bucket list for sure, it seems incredible.


        |    been to seychelles, it //    is an amazing place. Best //    holiday I had!


        |Lived there almost 19 years :) It is quite amazing.

    |I can practically smell the sea and hear the waves. 


        |And taste the turtle.


    |I came here for turtles.////This post has none.////I am disappointed.


        |Came here for a Roger's Profanisaurus reference. Very disappointing. 


            |As in:////**turtle's breath**//*n.* The very final warning *fart* before the turtle pokes its head out to *autograp

    |reminds me of jak and daxter


        |Yeah, it looks straight out of a videogame.


            |First thing I thought when I saw this://"Wow this game looks sick!"


            |Looks like a WoW zone to me.


    |Paradise


    |Reminds me of Destiny Island.^Kingdom_Hearts


    |really says a lot of the violence that separated it from the continent with those huge fractured granites


    |The rock on the bottom left has a red spot that looks like a persons face.


    |Looks computer generated.


    |I hated that place. Maybe my experience was different but, here we go. Every person on the island was inbred, the food wasn
    |t any good, they wouldn't take their own currency and the exchange rate was whatever they decided it was that day. That sum
    | up my Seychelles experience. 


    |I am Seychellois,  is nice living here but we'll have to fly to dubai for shopping sprees


        |salut dallon


    |The smooth, vibrant colors make it look like a video game.


    |Reminds me of that island towards the end of Star Wars KOTR.


        |That's what I thought too! 


    |Penis shaped rock bottom right corner.


        |wait till you see the shape of their coconuts..

    |Id go there if it didnt cost so much from where I am.


    |Finally, my quest of becoming a real pirate is one step further.


    |Took me a second to understand the title


    |Thats so beautiful


    |indeed, it looks like Paradise


    |where is the 1980x1080?


    |Riven...


    |Very Nice. Reminds me of Kissing Camels ////http://www.wyattphoto.com/photo.php?id=155//


    |what a beautiful place!


    |Isn't that Anse Source d'Argent on La Digue? Beautiful place -- worth the long trip. If you go, also look for the less trav
    |led beach on the other side of the island, called Anse Cocos.////[edit for spelling]


    |The Seychelles has a great flag, too. 


    |looks like a game(:


    |Daym Africa!


    |That is fucking gorgeous


    |What does the title, "kiss of the turtle" mean? is that in reference to the rock formations?


    |Looks like Riven


    |What an amazing planet we have the good fortune of inhabiting. If only proper appreciation of our situation was more common
    |... Whenever I despair about mankind's survival, I think of the incredible diversity and beauty of our planet and vow to do
    |ble my efforts to keep this planet a viable home in spite of the chaos, conflicts and confusion amongst us.


    |yeah my friend lives there. I am so jealous. And all he does is rub it in by sending me pics like this all of the time.


    |My first thought on seeing this was "crysis 4!!"////On a side note, I hope they return to the series' roots with a beautifu
    | island like this. Part of why I loved farcry so much was the locale being so exotic.


    |I've been playing too much Wind Waker.


    |Lies. It's actually Koopa Troopa beach.

    |Forever known as//"That screensaver place".


    |That's a rock hard cock!


    |You just have to watch out for this one lady there.  She sell seashells by the sea shore in the Seychelles.


    |So Koopa Beach on MarioKart is a real thing?!


    |I don't speak creole zwer! 


    |False advertising, I see no kissing turtles.


        |Right?


    |This is like the exact locale in KotOR, when you crash land on that tropical planet.

            |Yes, but the photograph has been *heavily* photoshopped to make it look 'pretty' because the world looking pretty o

                |oh.  im colorblind, so I guess I didnt notice.


    |looks like firefall.


    |The seawater is milky due to fresh whale semen.


        |I hear that's good for your skin.


    |I see at least 3 penises in this photo. Still beautiful.


        |Rock dicks, everywhere...


    |i hate that this place is being talked about so much it was defiantly, number one on my list of places to hide from interna

    |Sounds like a porno.


    |Reminds me of Crysis.


    |I thought that this was from /r/offensive_wallpapers for a few seconds and I was staring at the image trying to find someth

    |Koopa Troopa Beach?


    |Looks like one of those Playmobil pirate island sets  :)


    |ooooh this is Koopa Troopa beach, right?
