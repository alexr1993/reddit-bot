I said... OPEN YOUR WINDOW!(/r/gifs)




    |Is there a source? Was he just being a dick, or was the driver being the dick? I'm guessing both...


        |[Well, there is, but I don't think there is one in english.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3dqFvj4hXs) What happened 
        |s driver suddenly tried to drive away as soon as he saw police, so officers asked him to pull over which driver didn't 
        |o. After a brief chase they forced him to stop. Driver was drunk and went "i know my rights im not giving you anything 
        | am not leaving car fuck you". Breaking a window seems like an overkill but well, whatever works.


            |Thanks... I'm team cop on this one then. 


                |I think the guy had that coming too. It was the safer thing to do knowing the drunk driver may take off again a
                |d jeopardize his life and others'.

                    |Breaking the window is going to stop him from driving away?


                        |Well, the cop can now get at the driver, or the keys &amp; turn off the vehicle. Or it could freak the

                        |The idea is it's safer for innocents.

                        |The glass used in vehicle windows is [tempered glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toughened_glass#Use
                        |). This means that, when it's broken, it readily fragments into small pieces. These are far less likely
                        |to cause injury than normal glass, which splinters into sharp pieces.


                            |They still cut the hell out of people. 


                        |It's a lot safer than giving the drunk guy a chance to start a high-speed chase. Car window glass is te

                        | damage. 


                |To add to that, the cop asked the driver to hand over the papers for inspection and the dude just said "No. I w
                |n't." The cop asked why and the guy just said "Eh, I don't want to."


                |I agree. Fuck drunk drivers. ////Oh, and give that cop a beer.


                    |I'm guessing he'd prefer vodka

        |I was with a friend once in college and he was pulled over for speeding and weaving in and out of traffic. The officer 
        |anted him to roll down the window more than the sliver he'd already lowered it. It was raining and cold and so my pal d
        |clined with the words, "Nah, it's too cold." The officer grabbed on to the top of the window pane and proceeded to snap
        |it toward himself in an effort to break the glass. The glass did indeed shatter; however, the cop sliced a huge, bloody
        |gaping gash into his right hand. There was blood and glass everywhere. We were freaked out, but also kind of laughing i
        | that sort of, "shit, we're high as fuck and this pig just cut his hand off trying to look like a badass..." The cop st
        |rted shrieking like a banshee "oh fuck, oh fuck," etc. He ran back to his car and sped off. So, we left. We thought it 
        |as over and luck was on our side. Nevertheless, my buddy received a ticket in the mail about a week later for speeding.
        |I guess the cops checked out the dashboard camera and picked up where the bleeding pig left off.

                    |but why doesn't the rock shatter it? I thought that rock was harder than glass as well.


                        |Might be because the rock hits with a much larger surface area, so the force is distributed much more e
                        |enly, resulting in far less damage.


                        |It's actually not. You can grade all elements on the Moh's scale of hardness. Rocks are usually compris
                        |d of elements which are less hard than glass.


                |Ceramic is [harder](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_and_why_does_a_spark_plug_break_safety_glass) than glass.  


            |For people like me, who want to know why this works:////&gt; Tempered glass, which is used for the side windows of 
            |ost vehicles, is manufactured with an extremely high surface compressive stress and high internal tensile stress, g
            |ving it strength and durability, but also causing it to abruptly shatter into thousands of tiny pieces when it brea
            |s. The result is that the hard, sharp shard of ceramic, when projected with a bit of force, creates a small scratch
            |in the glass, which then rapidly propagates across the entire piece of glass as the internal tension is released.[c
            |tation needed] The glass subsequently shatters into many small pieces. However, ninja rocks are ineffective against
            |windshields, as they are made of a laminated type of safety glass, and therefore do not shatter.////http://en.wikip

            |What's the science behind why it breaks it so easily?


                |A good while back there was a video of a "glass tear" called [Prince Rupert's Drop](http://www.youtube.com/watc
                |?v=6V2eCFsDkK0); the large part of the glass is so compact and held together by its own intertal tension that h
                |tting on it does nothing, but flicking the tail makes it explode because you've chipped a portion of the materi
                |l and given that tension a way to release.////A similar principle applies here: the ceramic is so sharp that it
                |creates a small puncture in the high-tension glass and the internal balance of the material is disrupted, causi
                |g it to shatter quite violently.


            |Oh shit, this is real. I initially thought it was a 'joke vid'. It was quite unexpected, thank you.


            |Is it all porcelain, or only specific kinds?

            |Ugh I see this comment everywhere and it still pisses me off. If youve ever been to Newcastle, you would know Geord
            |e is nothing like this.


            |What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class i
            | the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.
            |I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but jus
            | another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this 
            |arth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again,
            |fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now
            |so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life.
            |You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s jus
            | with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal o
            | the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the
            |continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was a
            |out to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now yo
            |’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dea
            |, kiddo.

            |Oh shit i pised my pants pls dont kil me Mire.


    |Yeah, there are some countries where its just a bad idea to confront the law. In Germany, if the Polizei suspects you of dr
    |ving drunk and you don't want to blow into a tube, they will take a blood sample by force. No pesky fourth and fifth amendm
    |nts for cops over there to worry about! 


        |How much blood are we talking about ? A litre or so ?


            |About 8 gills.


                |I'm still not clear on this, vis a vis, units of measurement.   


                |two pints!


                |Imperial or customary?


            |That depends on where the bullet hits you


            |I think just a vial so they can test BAC. Thankfully I never had to find out! I served over there in the military a
            |d they briefed us to 100% comply with Polizei at all times or expect a beatdown. 


        |So, being a german polizei vampire would be great @.@


        | My former boss said when he was stationed there American soldiers where constantly getting the shit beat out of them b
        |cause they'd get drunk, try and give shit to the polizei and have there asses handed to them.


            |Reminds me of a funny story I'd forgotten about.  We were at this Irish Pub downtown in a city in Germany. It was f
            |equented by Americans. Anyways, I'm an officer and several of my friends were there and saw some enlisted soldiers 
            |e knew. We said hi and spoke to them for a few minutes. I remember noticing an older lady was there. We then left a
            |d went back to it area. ////A few minutes later, I see a huge malay in the bar. The soldiers I had just seen were b
            |awling and just beating down these other for Americans. I ran over there and was like, "wtf are you doing?" ////Dud
            | was like,  "that guy hit my mom."  I looked over and saw the older lady with a black eye. Knowing what would happe
            | if they hung around, we shuffled them out of there trying to get them away from the guys they beat down and their 
            |mminent loss of rank. When they got outside there were MPs and Polizei waiting for them. ////I quietly explained wh
            |t happened to them and their eyes widened and they saw the guys mom and were like, "get them out of here, now!"  Th
            |n they went inside and arrested the guys who were beat down. ////TL;DR- If you punch someones mom in front of them,
            |expect everyone in the world to be against you. ////


        |This is no different in America. If you refuse a field sobriety test, they'll hold you there, call up a judge for a qui
        |kee warrant, and then bring you back to stick a needle in your arm. Plenty of jurisdictions have to actually strap you 
        |o a gurney or bed to do so.


        |Later in the vid they show his face. Looks like they beat the shit out of him for it too.


        |They do that in the states too.


        |Since when do american cops care about the 4th and 5th amendments?


            |If they don't, it can be painful for them. Google "Bivens Violation"..... Basically, if a law enforcement officer k
            |owingly commits a fourth amendment violation they're subject to being PERSONALLY liable in civil courts. Basically,
            |they can lose every asset they own and their agency has no recourse to help them out. 


            |American cops just wait 20 minutes to get a judge out of bed and sign a warrant for a blood test.


            |Reddit no likey social commentary.


    |funfact: In the US you are not legally required to fully open your window when pulled over for traffic violations. 


        |But wouldn't you be refusing an order? Don't they have a law to cover that?


            |When the legal system allows cops to trump up a charge on someone to get an arrest warrant, the people resist (gett
            |ng the additional charge of resisting arrest), the trumped charge is found as fake, and the person can still go to 
            |ail for simply resisting arrest, the laws are fucked up.


            |Refuse what order? You did open your window.


            |Yes. It's called obstruction of justice.


    |I see your copper fisting a window and raise you a police baseball bat attack on a mini cooper////http://www.theguardian.co

    |I'm sorry I couldn't hear what you were saying.


    |Car windows are much easier to break when they are not fully closed.//


    |The Russian police are stern. Stern, but fair. 


    |Can someone translate what they were saying?


    |Stop exercising your rights, citizen.


    |Nice right hook

    |Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car


    |I used to work driving new and used cars off of auto rail traincars.  //On a few rare occasions, a car would arrive with ke
    |s locked inside and be unable to wedge/slim jim open. The trains have to stay on schedule no fucking around with time...   
    |/We had to resort to busting a window.  //We didn't have those little Life Hammer things.  //Anyways, those windows are har
    | as hell to break with a blunt object (when fully closed).  //I could just be a wuss though.


    |It's just Russia.


    |This is either fake or that car has glass from the 1930's.


    |He saw a window of opportunity, and he didn't mind the pain.


    |That was kinda badass.


    |The dude wears the dress well,by all accounts.

    |Russia? //Russia!


    |U.S. cop would have shot the window out - human life be damned

    |**BLJAAAD!**


    |Of course they're Russian.


    |typically a window punch is used to describe the device generally used for this. However this is a much more literal sense.


    |What I wouldn't give for that to have been bullet-proof glass.


    |Even though what he did might be unnecessary I have to give the cop credit.  He sure knows how to throw a decent punch.


        |He elbowed it and it wasn't fully open. Considering this and the fact that he would have had a minor adrenaline rush fr
        |m the situation, I would guess that any well-built person could have done it.////But yeah, pretty unnecessary. 


    |damn that cop has a fist made of iron. Car windows hurt.

    |Don't let the news reporter with the hammer from tosh see this. 


    |Sooooo I'm that guy who punched a closed window before. ////It was my own car, long story, but the windowwas ccompletely cl
    |sed. When I punched it it literally exploded. I dunno if it was because the car was completely sealed or what. But it serio
    |sly exploded and went EVERYWHERE. //So it would have been cool to brag about it except I cut a tendon completely in half in
    |my middle finger. That was the only cut I had on my hand. Just a inch and a quarter gash on the middle knuckle. //Went for 
    |titches, ending up being scheduled for emergency surgery. //(I'm a glass punching superhero, ama)

        |No; if it were, there would have been more cops and a lot of shooting.


            |I must be such a lucky guy. I've been pulled over three times and never shot. I should go buy a lottery ticket, I'm
            |so fucking lucky to survive three police encounters. That's like getting struck by lightning fifteen times in terms
            |of probability.
