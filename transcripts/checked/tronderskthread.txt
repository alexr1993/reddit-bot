Homeless Man Who Was Offered Coding Lessons Instead of $100 Set To Launch His First Mobile App(/r/Technology )




    |He'll get more than $100 for the book deal and movie rights. ////The Pursuit of App-yness.//


        |You're hired.


            |What's his job?


                |His first job is naming his position.


                    |Currently positioned in a box down alley way.


                |Inquisitive mind, I like that, you're hired too!

                |That wikipedia article reads like it was written by some reddit fanboy with nothing better to do. And it probab

                |Thats not a screenplay. That's just a story. It's still cool.

                        |That doesn't change the fact that what is in that comment isn't a screenplay. Why did you feel the need
                        |to "correct" his statement?  It was completely accurate. 


                        |Oh, I didn't know that. That's still not a screenplay though(in the link, not what he wrote later.) Any

                |That's really impressive!

            |Angry Reddibirds?////^^Please ^^put ^^me ^^out ^^of ^^my ^^misery 


    |Thats pretty cool.  I would love to learn that.  He made a good choice!


        |Absolutely. As much credit as the McConlogue gets, and he rightly should, just as much credit should go to Leo for pass
        |ng up $100 in cash for books and a crash course on coding. Not a lot of non-homeless people would even take that offer.


            |What was the motivation behind offering him 100 dollars or coding classes?  That seems like such a bizarre way to f
            |ame the whole story.  He obviously talked to the guy before, why not just offer to teach him to code without forcin
            | in a bootstraps vs instant gratification angle?////edit: I guess I'm saying I think it says a lot more about McCon
            |ogue that he offered the $100 than it does about Leo for not taking it.  There's some weird trading places savior c
            |mplex thing going on for McConlogue, but all it means for Leo is that on that particular day, he valued learning to
            |code at more than 100 bucks.


                |"You want $100, or do you want books and a laptop, valued at $300, plus $700 worth of private coding lessons?"/
                |//He was testing to see whether or not Leo was worth his time.


                    |Exactly. I heard Zappos does something similar. They offer every new employee $5k on their first day to qui
                    |. It separates those who just want some quick and easy cash from those who really want to work there and do
                    |a good job. ////Besides, if the guy want into learning the stuff the whole process wouldn't go well. 


                        |They are exploiting a flaw in human reasoning where once you have refused a certain amount for somethin
                        |, that something is now always for more than the amount.////After refusing the employee will always rec
                        |ll "hey this is worth at least 5k$, I better make it worth it !"


                        |what the fuck 5k on the first day to quit? this amount takes a year of my time, and some person can jus
                        | go in a job and take that much and leave?


                            |what do you do for money?


                                |i work as a cashier in a third world country, i make 450$ a month, or like 2$ an hour.

                        |Ha, as if you wouldn't take the 5K...

                        |Price would be much higher.////Edit: side-note, it is interesting to consider though. Someone with some
                        |hing to lose might take the $100. Not because they are lazy or uninterested in learning, but because of
                        |the level of trust one would have with a stranger on the street. Take $100, no strings attached, or mee

                            |I would have taken the $100 and I paid tens of thousands of dollars for my degree that is supposed 
                            |o show I can code. Now, a big part of that is lack of trust for random strangers but not all of it

                            |omeone that isn't an educator by trade.////Learning to do things isn't typically the real barrier.


                    |It also shows his commitment to Leo that he was willing to commit to teaching him. He was willing to fork o
                    |er $100 so it shows that him offering to teach him coding wasn't an empty promise.

                |He was probably trying to get him to analyze his current situation and make a decision he would stick with. ///
                |It was a way of giving him a clearcut choice between a life living from meal to meal and a life where he could

                |t was a pretty lucrative way of making a living.


                |The way I saw it was that McConlogue wanted to know if Leo had character and was worth investing his time into.
                |If there was no counter-offer it would have meant less when Leo accepted the coding lessons, etc. But, him pass
                |ng up the money and instant gratification showed that he had integrity and really wanted to learn and would tak

                |I believe the point of it was to help combat this idea many working class citizens have that homeless people ch
                |ose to be homeless and take hand outs rather than work. So he offered exactly that: A handout and opportunity t
                | work.


                |Incentive. If he had simply offered a long series coding classes, Leo may have agreed to to it simply out of bo

                |iously.


                |I remember this when it happened, the guy thought that the homeless man he passed all the time was atypical to 
                |ost of them he'd seen so, since he felt bad for him and his own time was valuable, he made him the offer to see
                |if the homeless guy was worth the investment of his time and energy.

                |You sound like a real person. Too bad. You walk past most homeless. But this guy might have a special case that

                |You'd be surprised.


            |I wouldn't even consider that offer, I hate coding. Respect to the homeless dude.


            |That is because many of them are starving and need the money. Maybe if it came as "coding, lunch, shower, a warm be

                |Great point.  This is what makes me highly skeptical about this.  If i was homeless, I would definitely forsake

        |[Relevant Doug Stanhope](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGTvWkmEAtM)


        |Give a man a fire...


        |teach a man to lisp


        |I don't know how to fish so I'd be wasting his time and mine.


    |Cool story but the $100 cash was no where on par with the value of the teaching offer. I think most homeless people would t
    |ke 8 weeks of 1 hour chitchat sessions with another person over $100. But maybe I am naive. 


        |I think you might be naive. That's not a bad thing to be like that. That said, I think most homeless people would take 
        |he $100.


            |Having been homeless before, I agree


                |Especially true for someone with a psychedelics habit.


        |Or the laptop. 


        |Depends how hard on the drugs they are.


        |Are there no homeless people in your area?  In my area, they commit felonies in order to score cheap junk to sell for $
        |0 to get something to huff or drink.  Rational thought isn't usually the forte of the homeless, else most of them proba
        |ly wouldn't BE homeless.////If you take someone who has no marketable skills, is unwilling or unable to actually "work"
        |for a living, and sees little to no point in the future other than getting high or drunk, and offer to teach them a 'us
        |ful skill', most won't see the point and will just tell you to get lost.  Whereas $100 is a pretty sweet score for them
        | especially since it requires zero work or effort or even thought.


    |"I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills..."


    |Did literally no one read the article?  //The top 3 comments and all of their children are referencing Apple or Google.////
    |e received 3 books on JAVASCRIPT and is clearly shown using a Chromebook. Not to jump on a soapbox but there is still a wid
    |ly untapped market for **good** web apps, and this sets him up to a prime position for capitalizing on it.


        |What are three good js books? 


    |Just to make it clear: this is not an example of how anyone can become a coder in no time and grab serious cash for hacker-
    |yping on a keyboard for a few days. "If this homeless guy can do it in a few weeks, I can do it for less time than that!" -
    |no. Do not relegate this profession to a "trick" which you can learn by reading one book, or present it as a cure-all for t
    |e homeless and jobless.////This, however is an example of how you can pull yourself out from the gutter if given an opportu
    |ity and some counseling, and that homeless people are... well... people. I'm just sorry to say that many homeless would not
    |accept offers like this and would just take the 100$ to spend on bad stuff.


        |&gt; I'm just sorry to say that many homeless would not accept offers like this and would just take the 100$ to spend o
        | bad stuff.////So would most other people, but we only look down on them for it if they're homeless. 


            |I wouldn't accept his offer because I don't have the time or motivation to learn something completely irrelevant to
            |both my career and my interests.////Are you suggesting that I should be looking down upon because I would choose th
            | $100?


            |I wouldn't accept a random stranger's proposal like that, but then again, I do have a home. If, however, I did find
            |myself to be homeless (and hopefully not drunk/on drugs), I would much rather appreciate a fighting chance than a s
            |m of money.////I'm not judging anybody nor am I looking down upon anybody, it's just that I think giving chances is
            |more important than giving some money.


                |You wouldn't accept a  persons proposal of giving you 100$ for doing nothing?//////////okay.


                    |Relevant username.////Some people have decided to move through life with something other than convenience a
                    | their foremost motivation. Being offered something of value for no effort should draw skepticism, and some
                    |people trust their own skepticism enough that if they aren't given what they feel is a good explanation, th
                    |y won't accept the offer.


                        |Does that mean I can have your free 100$ ?////////I'm willing to risk this one.


                |&gt; I wouldn't accept a random stranger's proposal like that, but then again, I do have a home.////I have a ho

                | then again, I'm already taking 400 level CS classes.


                |Sooooo, can I have your share?


            |That's because other people don't ask you for money.


            |I'd accept it and go buy a pack of cigs, I'd be a terrible homeless person.


        |Agree. "Learning to code" is relatively easy. The hard part is quality software development.


            |Hence why a good developer can switch languages/frameworks pretty easily. The hard stuff isn't writing code the com
            |uter understands, it's doing it in a way which is maintainable, efficient, scalable, dependable and easy to underst
            |nd for humans. But let's not rain on reddits "everyone should learn programming - it's so easy"-parade. Let them th
            |nk they are full-fledged developers after a couple of courses on code academy.


        |it's also a story about a blogger looking to generate attention for himself turned a generous act into a ton of free pu
        |licity.


        |Can't help but feel you're insecure about your profession (I'm making some assumptions here). As a dev myself, I don't 
        |ind if people thought this way. If anything, it makes a good programmer so much more valuable on the market. Anyone who
        |is not serious about this will do nothing but contribute to the noise.


        |Oh please; programming is just like using a holodeck on Star Trek.  You learn a handful of magic commands and the compu
        |er just does the rest for you.  Anyone with a little knowledge could build a major search engine, Photoshop, a social p
        |atform or a complex mobile app in a few days.  


            |Is that why there's so many requests on Craigslist for someone willing to do those things for $200?


    |after only reading the title I thought "big fucking whoop" I can "launch" and Android app that just shows a picture of a un
    |corn, it doesn't mean a damn thing.////honestly though, I doubt it will be something so simple. I am glad that the man show
    |d interest in learning a new skill instead of just taking $100. I really do hope that he is putting time into making someth
    |ng cool and that he is successful.


        |He got a $1000 Macbook Air out of the deal [examine the picture]. 


            |That's a Samsung Chromebook... look at the hinges


    |Teach a man to fish, yadada, yadada. Exept that considering the current state of "app" market, he's been taught to fish in 
    |n empty 55 gal. drum shared with five other starving fishermen. Silly heart-warming story for believers in silly rag-to-ric
    |es american mythology.


        |Yeah, unlike the other "me too" app developers, he already has a marketing niche: "The homeless coder".////The fact tha
        | this artlcle even got on front page reddit, means that he is getting exposure that your everyman app developer can onl
        | dream of.


            |He's just taking market share without actually providing a better service.////So in other words his app is going to
            |make other people homeless.


                |Wait, what? Envious much?////I can't speak of his app, but marketing-wise, he (and his team) definitely have do
                |e a good PR job.


            |Meh, we still don't even know what his app is/will be, and by the time it's done, reddit will have long forgotten h
            |m.


        |He's still 99% closer to releasing an app than I. Good story. 


        |On the other hand, the coding lessons he received alone were worth much, much more than $100. That shit's expensive.


            |You can easily learn to code for free on the internet or the library.


                |Maybe, maybe not (I would argue not). But this guy was given lessons by a professional. That costs money.


                    |The second part is true, I'll admit, but I'd argue that the majority of the learning when it comes to codin
                    | is self taught anyways. Other than memorizing what commands, etc. do what, pretty much the entire process 
                    |s just learning how to pay attention for mistakes and fix them.////As for the first, yes, you really can le
                    |rn easily and for free.  There's a ton of websites devoted to teaching that are completely free like code a
                    |ademy, and there's also games like Roblox or pretty much anything with mod support that gives you a real re
                    |son to start playing around with code and see how it affects things.


                    |I haven't spent a penny learning C, C++, Java, the web stuff (HTML/CSS/js), and Ruby on Rails, yet I am pro
                    |icient enough to have had a few web dev contracts in my free time with some local companies. ////You defini
                    |ely *can* learn it online, for free. 


                        |Why don't you have a full time job with a software development house?


                        |It's pretty much standard way professionals do it. 90% of software developers never had any 'training',
                        |other their cs degree(If they went). They just learned it on the job.


                    |Pretty much any programming book was written by a professional. ////There are hundreds of online forums/irc
                    |channels where you can ask professionals specific questions.////In my comment to abeezmal I pasted several 
                    |inks where you can learn from professionals. Many are university courses taught by professionals.////You co
                    |ld probably just walk into any introductory CS course at a university if it's a lecture with more than 50 s
                    |udents no one is going to notice you aren't actually a student.//


                |yea but for a layman to get guided lessons is not free.


                    |Plenty of guided lessons online. Several universities even offer free online CS courses. 


                        |I'll look into that, thanks

                |Or completely by yourself with a beginner's compiler like bloodshed, or even just a text editor, a bash console
                | and python installed.  Which, by the way, is the development environment for almost everybody for works at twi
                |ter.  Except the math guys, who also use rstudio.


            |True.


        |I mean, if hes making android apps, he's learning Java basics(albeit in the context of the android operating system).


        |usually you would be correct however i guarantee no matter how useless the app he creates is, a lot of people will buy 
        |t just to support a homeless guy


        |I know right. I don't even know why people get out of bed. It's so hard to live in America.


        |I think your missing the point.  ////He is learning a skill that can be applied in many different directions if he is c
        |mmitted to it.  But the real gold is all the publicity he is getting.  If he puts together even a shitty but functionin
        | app that shows he has been learning its likely many people will buy it just to show support for him.  Others may even 
        |et on board to fund his further education and companies might hire him to a very entry level position and give him more
        |training just for good PR.


            |I don't think I missed anything - I think we both agree that he's conciously surfing on the heart-warming feeling h
            |s story would evoke in the american psyche rather than on his actual skills. I wish him all the best, really, and I
            |do hope he gained some real skills in the process - but as another redditor has pointed out, we have no idea what h
            |s "app" actually is. There is that big headline celebrating the fact that a homeless man created an "app", but an "
            |pp" can be something as simple and pointless as a five-line software that will show the picture of a pink unicorn o
            | your screen. The fact that the article carefully avoid to describe the app is ground for skepticism.


        |Can't tell if mad european or mad american??  


        |do you mean yada yada yada?//you FUCKING idiot fucking stupid fucking horse cock in your asshole cunt//


        |very true, no one has ever made it rags-to-ritches in America. 


            |It's not that nobody ever made it from rags to riches, some people did. What is wrong, however, is to think that th

            |fore "rag-to-riches" is bullshit.


                |Well... I'm going to go jump off a bridge now.

        |&gt; Silly heart-warming story for believers in silly rag-to-riches american mythology.////Someone sure is frustrated.


    |I think people are surprised by these kinds of stories because as a society we tend to forget about the homeless. I mean, w
    |y can't a homeless person learn how to code and create an app? What's so fucking extraordinary about that? People from all 
    |alks of life become homeless, for all sorts of reasons. To frame it as being "unjustly homeless" is to simplify poverty and
    |circumstance in such a disgusting, remedial way. ////The only interesting thing about this is that a privileged, selfish pe
    |son did something kind and realized that when you're not being a dickass and treating people from other walks of life as le
    |ser than you, you might realize they're fully formed, cognizant beings too. 


        |Wait.... if he did something kind, than how does that make him a selfish person? 


            |The blog posts he wrote about it kind of reeks of entitlement, dude. //&gt;…this morning, I saw step one. He had fo
            |nd chains and was doing lifts by throwing them over his neck. I suck at empathy but my two-sizes-too-small heart sn
            |pped a little seeing this. It was epic drive, here was this homeless guy with chains around his neck fighting to no
            | to give up. It was movie poster worthy. It was drive.////I mean, my feelings about it are basically summarized [he

            | myself to articulate why he seems like a selfish person.//


                |Oh I wasn't disagreeing with the entitlement. I'd also say pretentious. But selfish? To me, selfish would have 
                |een looking at him and thinking, "Sorry bro, not my problem, but best of luck to you," and, as the linked artic
                |e in your comment (not sure if you wrote it or not) says, quickened his pace. To me, that's the selfish reactio
                |. Keep the $100 dollars and laptop, and not waste time helping a homeless man learn a skill. ////Now, I'm not s
                |ying he's a great man. Should he have asked his name? Of course. Could he have done this without, "karma whorin
                |," for lack of a better term. Oh ya, but as your linked article says. He's at least doing something. I feel lik
                | we are judging the programer in the same way he judged, "Journeyman Hacker." I've never met the man before. He
                |may have been raised in a very privileged home and this is his first attempt at trying to truly enter the human
                |race and help his fellow man. If that's the case, he may not know the, "social etiquette," or humility for this
                |situation. Eh, I can attribute that to being human and making mistakes like the rest of us.////I do agree that 
                |e has character flaws, but I just can't call, "selfishness," one of them. 


        |We need more of this person's attitude!


    |Remember that it's going to be hard for him to sustain the constant growth in coding knowledge and marketing research he's 
    |oing to need to make a living off this. Homelessness is a systemic problem, and it requires systems to help him get out of 
    |t.////He's going to need shelter, food, and medical care - there's only so long that adrenaline and the pursuit of one's ow
    | betterment can take you before the effects of poor diet, exposure, and deferred medical care take their toll. Coding is so
    |ething that can help many people survive, but there are also unwritten rules of etiquette in the profession and other painf
    |l lessons he's going to have to learn like anyone else just starting out, and he has *no* safety net to fall back on when s
    |mething goes wrong on his journey. I hope he gets the support he needs.


        |He could probably get a job as a jr developer with only a few apps under his belt. That is a decent job. 


            |I really, really hope so. I want nothing but good for him. I wish it were so that everyone could have those same op
            |ortunities. My heart wouldn't break so often, if they could.


                |One thing I have decided is that if I ever start my own business, and need to get a second person to help with 
                |tuff, I would most likely go to my local rescue mission or whatever and find someone there willing to learn a n
                |w skill and work hard for a better future. A lot of IT work isn't hard, it just requires you to pay attention a
                |d work hard. It can all be taught relatively easily and quickly.


        |so youre saying he should have taken the $100 or do you just like making irrelevant negative comments?


            |No. For the love of crap, I'm saying that if you live in some sort of libertarian fantasy world where everyone can 
            |ift himself up by his bootstraps then you don't know shit about the world - and if you're feeling good about yourse
            |f because some other person in your identity group taught a homeless person a lesson, then shake yourself out of yo
            |r stupidity coma and realize that this probably isn't enough for this one guy, much less an entire population of pe

            |Make it anyways, but try to make it a little better, or make it do something that hasn't already been done :)

    |The next lesson that the homeless man will learn is how little he will make selling mobile apps.


    |Before you know it he'll have a main role in Superman 3. 


    |There goes the tech job market


    |This is beautiful shit. Give people opportunities. Some will fail, but many will be in a better place than they were before
    | As a culture we should use this as a guiding light. Throwing money at it isn't always the best way.


        |You do realize the majority of homeless people suffer from severe mental illness?


    |Looks like a Macbook Air.//Hardly a "cheap laptop".


        |It's a Chromebook. Aluminum finish + black keyboard doesn't make it a Mac.


        |Its a $250 chromebook


        |Could be a first generation one that the guy wasn't using anymore.


        |Cheap for basic iOS programming if you're a roaming homeless person.


        |[deleted]


            |Yeah I thought that too but then I saw the keyboard and thought it must be Apple.////Dell knockoff? Maybe.


                |It's a chromebook.


                    |Can a Chromebook compile Java code?

    |One question, why is he holding a Tizen phone?  And if he is developing for Tizen, wouldn't that limit his audience, and th
    |refore his ability to monetize?


    |Something just REEKS about this story.////Besides anyways, this whole "teach everyone how to code" nonsense is just an atte
    |pt to drive down wages. It's SOMEONE'S brilliant idea. If enough people learn how to code, all these people will be making 
    |inimum wage.


        |Yeah, because the only reason we aren't awash in competent coders is because it didn't occur to people that that would 
        |e a lucrative job.


    |your title is awfully confusing.


    |Goes to prove you can do any thing you set your mind to


    |Have in mind what kind of choices this homeless man might have been rejecting in the past.////The most important and genera
    | choice we are all making is between what we need and what we want and inability to make that choice is source of demise fo
    | many.


    |I do pretty well for myself and I get a lot of shitty relatives asking me for money. I always offer to teach them to code. 
    |hey always turn it down and don't speak to me for a couple years. Then they ask me for more money.


        |so about teaching code..........


    |What's the name of his app?


        |Go Green. Hasn't launched yet, before you go looking for it.


    |Title says he was Offered Coding Lessons, instead of being offered $100.////It is not what we are offered that counts, but 
    |what we choose*. YOU are surrounded by options right now, some you aren't even aware of, but all of them within your power

    |Hope you make it buddy.


    |all those feels.


    |Learn to fish. Always the best choice.
