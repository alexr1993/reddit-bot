80yr old man is shot and killed in his bedroom by LAPD officers after reports of his home "smelling like a meth lab". No methamphetamine or paraphernalia was found.(/r//r/news)




    |No-knock warrants are a terrible terrible thing.  It basically removes the right of a citizen to defend themselves when the
    |r door randomly gets knocked down.  How am I supposed to know that loud crashing is the police and not a group of violent t
    |ugs intent on robbing me and raping my wife?  ////Is the war on drugs so fucking important that it's legally and morally ju
    |tifiable to just barge someone's door down?  Haven't we seen this fail enough times to rethink such policy?


        |I just don't understand it either... It's got to be unconstitutional.


            |The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads as follows://&gt; "The right of the people to be secure in thei
            | persons, **houses**, papers, and effects, **against unreasonable searches** and seizures, shall not be violated, *
            |and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,**////&gt; The Fourth Amendment applies to a search only if a 
            |erson has a "legitimate expectation of privacy" in the place or thing searched.////[Site source](http://www.nolo.co

                |They found a couple grams of weed though, so there really was a drug operation going on. It's all okay now that
                |police barged into his home unannounced and shot him to death.


                |What are you trying to state with this? 


                    |That we are a police state 


                        |The Fourth Amendment means we are a police state? ////Ok


                            |No no no, what I got from it was that this is evidence that the no knock warrants are unconstitutio
                            |al because of the 4th amendment, and we have become a police state.////I'm pretty sure that's what 
                            |e was getting at anyways, with the bolding of the word house, and unreasonable searches. Not only a
                            |e no knock warrants themselves unreasonable because they call into question the security of our hom
                            |, but the flimsy reason for the search was unreasonable, which also goes into his emphasis on proba
                            |le cause.


                |things like this ultimately led me to quit putting hand over my heart when the pledge is being recited


            |Last I checked it is.


                |Yeah but you morons think Abraham Lincoln giving sole power to interpret the constitution to 9 gimps is the bes

                    |Uh, what?


                        |That's how far down the river you Americans are, that that statement confuses you.


                            |It's complete nonsense you egotistical fuck. 


                                |Today I feel like mocking you, not helping, so carry on beating your head for my enjoyment.


                                    |Wow, you're SO much better than everyone. 


                                        |I am, thanks.  Especially compared to people like you.

            |Its pretty fucking unconstitutional.


                |Actually, it's probably not. It's morally wrong and dangerous for honest citizens, but once they have a warrant

                |t was imperfect and needed to be amended over time, but we haven't been doing our due diligence. 


            |It sure is VERY against our Constitution. What is really sad about today is that no one is being taught that this d
            |cument is what is in place to protect our rights. We the people are solely the only one's who can enforce it unfort
            |nately. Just try and mention the Constitution in r/politics, down votes everywhere I don't understand it. 


            |Constitution is more like guide lines, that is easy to twist and bend to mean whatever you want.


            |Lol, the constitution is just words, it doesn't actually mean anything any more.


            |It's not 


        |The people that murdered this guy *are* a group of violent thugs.


        |A lot of people killed during this kind of warrant are people trying to defend themself against a supposed agressor...

    |I've been to a few clandestine labs - they smell like piss. The first one I went to was at a university accommodation build

        |Not all of them, I bet. You know whose house also smells like piss? A cat hoarder or a dog hoarder. So are the police g

            |Oh yeah? Well *my* 83 year old grandfather is a walking fucking piss stain! Can't have him over without pissing all
            |over the couch! How about *them* beans motherfucker?!


                |Oh yeah? Well, my Grandpa could outstain your Granpda!


        |That's just old man smell silly. 


        |I agree.  I have run into a few labs for one reason or another due to my employ.  The first time was memorable.  Its li
        |e someone taking the foul flavors of piss and mixing them with hard chemicals.  Its something you never forget.  Not th
        | sweet bum alcohol piss smell, the acrid smell of old piss.  


        |Did they even look to see who lived in the house? It would of taken maybe 2-3 minutes to figure out who lived in the ho
        |e. Its hard to believe they thought a 80 year old had a meth lab in his house. that's insane. 


        |Indeed,  it has a very sour smell., "Pissy like"


        |How would his neighbors know what Meth smells like?


        |Smelling like piss, being gross, and living in squalor won't get the police called on you. A false report of child porn

        |Yeah, cat piss to be exact.////I was in a vacant house once that smelled like the owner hoarded cats...Except the carpe
        | was clean and there were no stains underneath on the padding, etc. Which was odd until we talked to the city hall and

                |Sadly it will probably go in their statistics of the war on drugs that way.

            |t he's an idiot for pointing a gun at an officer.


            |A full on drug operation I'm sure.


        |Marijuana? In California?? Obviously this man was running some sort of drug operation out of his house and deserved to 
        |ie. In fact, we should just go around and kill everyone in California who has weed, that would bring the population dow
        | to about...10. 


            |&gt;“There was a drug operation that was certainly going on in this house,” Whitmore said.////The sheriff departmen
            | spokesperson is seriously attempting to use that as a defense.


        |Kinda curious how much. Surely not a bale... or they would be bragging. Did they find a roach? An oz.? No one is saying
        |.. about how the cops planted the drugs... :-)


            |Guy probably had a medical card. :(


        |Did it say how many marijuanas?    


        |The fact that they even mentioned marijuana in the report is an incredible injustice to the events that happened.  As i
        | having marijuana made him guilty of something, and the shooting can possibly be justified.


        |"on the property" not "in the home"////What this means in reality is that the investigative unit showed up once there w
        |s a report of a death.  It was then difficult to plant the weed near the scene so they put it somewhere else.  At least
        |that is what a bad cop would do, not these upstanding citizens.


        |Seriously, who knows what kind of a terrible life that might have led to for that old man?


        |Was it even illegal? 


        |California is a medical marijuana state, for those who don't pay attention to those things.  This is pretty shoddy jour
        |alism to use the cop's quote without any context whatsoever.


        |Did you read the last line?  Regarding the marijuana, police stated "There was a drug operation that was certainly goin
        | on in this house."


        |Just a little nugget for the ultra right to help them with the cognitive dissonance. 


        |Goddamn I can't wait for the day when they can't use this anymore to try and justify ruining (literally) someone's life
        |for more Federal kickbacks


            |Don't get your hopes up, it's going to be a long, long time. Perhaps by the time you're 80 though.


        |And let the reddit cop hating, marijuana loving circle jerk begin.


            |It is OK to keep hating the drug war if it is actually counter-productive.  In fact, it is an obligation to keep ha
            |ing everything that is counter-productive.  As human beings it is one of our foremost jobs if we want a better worl
            |.


            |so reddit is the only place where people think that police murdering innocent people is wrong? or that cannabis is 
            |kay, and simply remains illegal for political and economic reasons?


            |An 80 year old man was murdered (they had no reason to do it so it's murder) by the cops and this is a "reddit cop 
            |ating circle jerk"? This is how you see this?


    |A warrant was issued because the place "smelled" of ingredients used to make meth.  A warrant issued because of a smell.///
    |Police didn't even see anything.  They smelled something.  Maybe.  Which then allowed them to break into a house and shoot 
    |n old man who tried to defend himself and his home.////A warrant.  Because of a smell.


        |Its also worth noting that the smell of a meth lab is. "rotten egg smell" and cat urine(ammonia) ... These are not unco
        |mon smells... and not even close to even a dog alert. 


            |Depending on the process, the smell of ether is also a dead giveaway. However, ether is also used in some over-the-
            |ounter products. For all we know, this guy was just putting starter fluid into some old clunky engine.


                |Yeah, fuck me for having nonpolar solvent


            |Lolwut? Even my farts sometimes smell like rotten eggs, there ain't a methlab up my butt


        |This is why in Massachusetts a smell cannot be used as evidence for either a search warrant or for a vehicle search. It
        |s way too easy for a cop to go, "Oh yeeaa, smell some weed sir, gonna have to search your car." and there is nothing at
        |that point to stop him or prove later on he wasn't just using a loophole to search your car. They can say "I smell weed
        |can I search your car?" but you are allowed to decline. Pretty much if a police officer is asking to perform a search, 
        |our consent is required. Otherwise they wouldn't be asking.


            |What other states ban this?


                |I honestly couldn't tell you. I only know that's how it is here because we have had a steady pace of decriminal
                |zing and voting for medical marijuana and the general attitude surrounding it has relaxed. We have had lots of 
                |ases turned down in court such as passing a joint being "distribution" and what I'm referring to is [Commwealth
                |vs Cruz](http://www.mass.gov/mdaa/court-decisions/court-decisions-by-date/2011-court-decisions/commonwealth-v-c
                |uz.html). The decision was to make clear that car searches can't be conducted on the basis of finding marijuana
                |alone or that odor can qualify as probable cause. It's also going to depend on the police officer though as som
                | won't follow this. From looking over some police forums for other states there seems to be a debate between "I
                |wouldn't use that alone as probable cause" to "[state vs folk](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ga-court-of-appeals/1
                |95588.html) gives me more than enough probable cause with odor." So in Massachusetts it's a bit more relaxed be
                |ause the majority of police here really don't care all that much about weed and get it. Most will still flip th
                |re shit over driving and smoking. I can only assume the stricter the state the more likely the police officer w
                |ll be to perform a search. Especially if there hasn't been any specific ruling in the courts.


            |I don't know specific laws in GA, but about a decade ago, my class had a couple of local county K9 officers come in
            |with their dogs for a presentation/demonstration about classical conditioning, which was the current subject we wer
            | covering at the time. ////After class, they were just hanging out, so I came up and made small talk. I asked the o
            |ficer if hypothetically, I had a baggie of weed in my bag and the dog gave it attention when I walked by, could the
            | legally search me. I'll have to paraphrase because it's been so long, but he replied with something along the line
            | of 'no, because it could also be a ham sandwich' and that the dog is just a tool they use, not making the calls. S
            |mething about how even though they're super obedient and highly trained, the bottom line is they're still dogs.////
            | told him about how a few years earlier, my high school was put on lockdown and drug dogs were brought in. They sni
            |fed out a locker, and once it was opened, the only thing in it was someone's brown sack lunch (I think the dogs eve
            |tually found drugs elsewhere on campus, but I left that part out). He said that's what he was talking about; that t
            |ere was already suspicion or a reason to bring the dogs in to specifically search the school. He said had they just
            |been there for a presentation like they just did for my class, that they wouldn't have searched that locker because
            |the dog's reaction wasn't enough grounds for a search. ////I'm still leery of it though. There's probably countless
            |loopholes he didn't tell me, but what he did tell me seemed reasonable/logical. 


            |So instead they'll just accuse you of being drunk and refuse to issue you a breathalyzer or blood test to prove the
            |r accusation, and send you to jail for a day if they want to bully you.////I speak from experience. Spent a day in 
            |ail for being "drunk in public" while completely sober. Tough guy cop kept making snide remarks about how he was tw
            |ce my size and could beat my ass (I'm a small dude) the entire ride to the jail.////US of fucking A!


            |FWIW, I was subject to a car search after one cop, who I wasn't getting along with on a traffic stop, loudly told h
            |s partner "I smell ammonia".  At the time I'd never heard of this scam, so the next day I searched my own car for a
            | hour trying to find anything that smelled like ammonia...


        |That's the entire basis of drug dogs, you realize.////It's even more bullshit when it's a dog, because he can't even ar
        |iculate for you what he smells.


            |And the dog can be influenced by the emotions and predispositions of his handler.


                |Also, the dog's handler can not give a shit about how the dog actually reacted and just say whatever they want,
                |because the only witness is a goddamn dog.


                    |This happened to me. The dog didn't bark or anything but the handler pulled up on his collar until the dog 
                    |ut his paws on my car. They said that was an indication and proceeded to search the car. There was no drugs
                    |nor had there EVER been any in that car.  I stood by petting the dog despite their warning that the dog cou
                    |d be dangerous.  


                        |I bet the dog looked up at you like, "You think you have problems... I gotta work with that dick every 
                        |ay."


                            |That's ridiculous, dogs love peanut butter.

                        |I saw a video on YT of a guy suing a police dept over one of these drug dog stops. They had just left s

                        |No for two (scratch that -- THREE) reasons. First of all, animals are not subject to the hearsay rule, 
                        |t least under federal rules and most common law jurisdictions. They cannot be cross-examined, so for po
                        |icy reasons, we do not hold any "statements" they make to the hearsay standard.////Additionally, hearsa
                        | does not apply to probable cause arguments anyway. Probable cause is a motivation - it does not go to 
                        |he truth of the matter asserted.////"Why did you respond to the robbery?" "Because I got a phone call f
                        |om dispatch advising me of shots fired by a 6 foot three black male." That is not hearsay, because it i
                        | only used to explain the decision-making of the officer rather than used to prove that a 6 foot three 
                        |lack male committed the crime.////Same with probable cause hearings. "Why did you believe you had to ge
                        | into that house?" "Because I believed there was a crime going on." "Why did you believe there was a cr
                        |me going on there?" "Because somebody told me there was a crime there."////Whether the person who told 
                        |hem there was a crime going on was lying is not the subject of the hearing. The subject of the hearing 
                        |s merely whether the officer had a good-faith basis to believe there was a crime. The hearsay test asks
                        |if the statements are still relevant even if we are able to assume that their contents are false. In th
                        | dog case, and in my example case, the statement's truth value is independent of the officer's honesty'
                        | truth value. The witness/dog could have been lying or incompetent, and the officer could still have a 
                        |erfectly valid reason to believe them anyway and do their job. The credibility of the declarant is not 
                        |hat is at issue, but the honesty or reasonableness of the officer's belief. That is why, during probabl
                        | cause hearings, the *officer* is subject to cross examination when proving probable cause, but all of 
                        |is underlying witnesses who allegedly back him up are not subject to cross-examination.////**AND THEN..
                        | even if for some completely stupid reason a judge called this hearsay**, there are no fewer than THREE
                        |exceptions to the hearsay rule in this exact instance for the dog: presence sense impression, excited u

                        |They never do.


                    |reminds me of that study where they said one of the people/cars had drugs and they had to find which one (s
                    |oiler: it was none of them) and only 1-2 handlers said they don't think any of them had anything on them. I

                    |the mere fact that they *think there might be* drugs somewhere leads them to pick just some car for no reas
                    |n makes me uncomfortable.


                |Handler knows dog detects nothing. Handler ignores it. Cops do there thing and kill someone. Investigation...ha
                |dler blames dog. Everybody blames dog. Dog gets put down. 


                    |Dog does not get put down.


                    |Cops do -their- thing.


                        |Don't be so pedantic. 


                |And by "influenced" I believe you mean the dog is trained to signal when his handler tells him to.////Drug dogs
                |aren't there to detect dogs. They're there to create an easy excuse for searching anyone the cop pleases.


                |You should do some research before you make comments like that. 


                |They are trained to do specific signs for specific smells.


                    |And the dog can still be influenced by the emotions and predispositions of his handler.


                        |I actually replied to the wrong post.  That was supposed to be in response to the dog not being able to
                        |articulate what he smells.  I do agree that dogs can be influenced by the mood and actions of their han
                        |lers.


                            |I too would like to hop on this karma train. Dogs are completely useless for smelling things out!


                    |They are really trained to alert where the handler wants.  There's a reason defense attorneys call them pro

                    |And unofficially, also trained to "report" on command. 


                        |Exactly, the officer can signal the dog to do it


                            |And signal is generally something completely unnoticeable to you.


            |And dogs have been shown to be extremely unreliable when it comes to detecting drugs. Huge rates of false positives
            |and failure to detect. There are tons of reasons for this including being influenced by the handler.


                |Like officers pointing to specific areas and saying "check here, check here, and here" and giving a sly command
                |for the dog to signal. Happened to me, was sitting in my truck while it happened, watching the dog and handler.
                |I didn't have any drugs or paraphernalia in the vehicle and never have. I think if you seem to have to tell the
                |dog where to "check" then obviously the dog isn't doing shit.

                    |for drugs. He refused, they brought out a dog, and the dog *immediately* jumped up on the van, which the co
                    |s told him was probable cause. An extensive search of the van followed.////Needless to say, there were no d

                        |Well obviously, if your driving a VW van, that's probable cause.


                        |I had my car searched because the cop said it smelled like pot. I could have refused, but I didn't want

                        | and saw me pulled over and stopped to see if I was okay. She knew I didn't smoke pot so when she asked
                        |the cop and he told her "I pulled him over for his taillight being out and the car reeked of the ol mar
                        |juana." she just gave him a puzzled look. She had to ask me to make sure, but I told her I just smoked 
                        |igarettes.//// The thing that really pissed me off was how certain it smelled like pot. He also dumped 
                        |y ash trays all in my car. I guess he was looking for roaches, but still pretty shitty. Bleh, that was

                        | you can do. I got a ticket for one time and of course it says I consented to a search. 


                        |Wouldn't having the dog come in and sniff around for probable cause constitute a warrentless search?


                        |That's another thing I completely forgot about: I was *super* fucking pissed at what the dog's god damn

                |I honestly used to have no problem with cops until I got to be about 16 years old. I'm a male and in their targ
                |t age range (17-25 ish) which causes me a ridiculous amount of trouble. I have plenty of stories but to sum up 
                |y two favorites...//// -A motorcycle cop tried to explain that "due to the angle and projectile" of where he cl
                |cked me with his radar gun, that i was actually going 3 miles faster than what the gun read. ...Ironically due 
                |o this 2mph bump that the gun didnt register I was now considered going so fast over the limit that I was "reck
                |essly driving." That means I could get my license taken away and get an awesome mark on record. Obviously he kn
                |w it wouldnt hold up in court and wrote down the inaccurate speed.////-This is my favorite. I was pulled over f
                |r going 3mph slower than the limit (I slowed down since this cop flew by me going way faster than everyone. He 
                |oticed i touched my breaks so he slammed on his so he could get behind me.) I Then spent the next 30 minutes te
                |ling the officer I did not, nor i have i ever taken methamphetamine. He proceeded to take my blood pressure and
                |told me it was 165BPM!!! I was obviously high on meth and he tried to manipulate me 5 times into letting him se
                |rch my car and every time I asked "Under what suspicion officer?" He would threaten that I was hiding something
                |and since I lied I'm going to jail for at least 6 months. Let me just remind you that in this scenario I just t
                |rned 18, I live in a urban area, and I was a 100 pound white kid. Obviously I was let go after 30 minutes of th
                |s. ////Sorry to any good police officers out there but I have been fucked around with too much. I wish I could 
                |ay the opposite but I have no respect towards the police any more. 


                    |I got pulled over by the cops once driving back from the video store with my girlfriend.  Cops said they sa
                    | us coming out of a known drug dealing area, we weren't ever anywhere near the street that they specified, 
                    |hey then called for back-up and drug dogs and without my consent searched my car. (said they smelled mariju
                    |na)  Going so far as to put the fucking dog in my car and let it tear shit up.  This all happened to me as 
                    | 19 year old white kid headed back to his apartment w/ the gf to watch a movie. (it wasn't even dark out ye
                    |) After they found nothing they sure as fuck didn't apologize.  I lost all respect for them then and there.


                        |I feel your pain dude! I feel bad for the nice cops out there since it's their co-workers (sounds weird
                        |but I can't think of the correct term) that is ruining their reputation and causing them to get hated/f

                            |I'm betting he just wanted to hold your hand.


                                |Lol he did look into my eyes for about 5 minutes straight, it was painfully long and awkward.


                            |I wonder what he would've done if the person he pulled over had actually medical training?

            |I think that's exactly right.  Hell, I know my rights and I still probably wouldn't have the balls to stand up for

                |bility to fuck my life over should be enough reason to be nervous. 


            |How the hell is it risky?  I've not heard of any cop ever getting even a finger wagged at him for "smelling" someth
            |ng that wasn't there.  There needs to be true metrics for searches.  IMO if an officer claims probable cause and fi
            |ds nothing, that should count as an unlawful search and the cop should be punished.


                |I guess you're right, it really isn't that risky. I believe you can press charges but I highly doubt you will e

                |Yeah, operating a bong. 


            |Maybe it's deputies who placed it on his property, not the first time that would happen during a wrong warrant...


            |Well it's legal here in Washington, guess we're all fucked.


            |... and it was probably one of the officers who planted it after they realized they fucked up.


        |Obviously they didn't actually find a meth lab here and, even if they did, it wouldn't justify shooting someone, but me
        |h labs can pose a danger to others living nearby. So even if method was legal, there would be a valid reason to bust so
        |eone rrunning a cook operation around other people. 


            |Lets be real, if there was a method on how to handle a meth lab it would be pretty dumb to not have a hazmat suit o
            | when kicking down the door and searching it if they are "100% sure" its a dangerous meth lab. So how could the pol
            |ce not know how harmful the by product is from cooking meth yet still "know the smell of a meth lab." ////If they w
            |re correct and it was a meth lab they could of been seriously injured if not killed from the fumes. Hell, if it was
            |a meth lab the "cook" who'd be wearing a mask could of gotten away due to the coughing, dying police. ////All im sa
            |ing is something stinks about this. 


                |I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure it would be possible for police to think "there is likely a meth has been co
                |ked here, which would pose a danger to others." At that point, they don't need to know whether its a Walter Whi
                |e controlled environment, relatively safe meth cook or chili P style cook that has a chance of poisoning the ne
                |ghborhood. I think the issue here is whether a vague smell is enough, on its own, to create probably cause to s
                |arch for a meth lab. I doubt many people would have a problem with police searching a place if there was undisp
                |tedly  probably cause that there was a meth lab present. Knowing there is a meth lab there is enough to know th
                |re is a danger to others.


                    |I agree with you!  And Hey, there is nothing wrong with a little Chili P to give a batch a little unique to
                    |ch. I don't see a problem for the police to check something out that is suspicious or reported. I do find t
                    |e warrant based solely off an officers nose to be a little loose. To top it off the no-knock warrant was ev
                    |n more loose or irresponsible for the judge to sign off on. ////I went off on a little irrelevant rant earl
                    |er. But, my thinking is if a meth lab was suspected then way more precaution should of been taken. 


        |"The lesson to be learned here is; don't pull a gun on an officer."  Damn that's cold.


            |Yeah, that angered me. Even assuming the old guy did pull a gun (not that he I believe he did), he pulled a gun cau
            |e he's an 80 year old man who can't see well being woken in the middle of the night to people storming into his hou
            |e with guns pointed at him. I can just imagine my grandpa in this situation, he would be completely confused and be
            |ildered, and if he had a gun within reach, and thought his family was in danger, I know he'd grab it. Hell, almost 
            |nybody in this situation would. ////I think the real lesson to be learned here is: "Don't raid people's houses in t
            |e middle of the nights with guns drawn based on a fucking smell."


            |Especially in your own home.


        |Obviously synthesizing marijuana in his pot lab.  


        |Technically, he allegedly ran an operation where he would buy a bag of weed, sometimes as much as 10..20 dollars worth,
        |and than proceed to smoke it. I'm speculating obviously but the police definitely brought down the empire exclusively t

            |It's an important distinction. Where I live, county sheriffs and members of their office are regarded more as peopl
            | who like to walk around with guns than as police officers. They are elected and they aren't considered real cops.


                |Sheriffs are elected nationwide (to the best of my knowledge) but deputies, policemen, troopers, DNR officers e
                |c are all state certified peace officers with the same authority, and none are elected. There is one elected ma
                | in the department.


                    |DNR is federal, I believe.

                    |Only the sheriff is elected. One person. The deputies are normal cops


                        |The elected guy is still a cop in almost every instance. It is not as if they just elect the local plum

                |Maybe that's true where you live, but in LA, the sheriffs certainly ARE real cops. The important point is that 
                |he LAPD and the LA County Sheriffs are two different forces. My brother in law is a deputy sheriff and my siste
                | is currently going through their training program. It is extremely tough. I am amazed at how much they have to
                |learn about legal codes, codes of conduct etc. Then there's the physical training, which is like millitary boot
                |camp and lasts 16 weeks. I actually feel better knowing that they have to go through all of that before they st
                |rt, but then I hear stories like this one and wonder how it could happen.


        |The LA county sheriff can't even legally carry a gun. It's the largest Sheriff department in the country and is run by 
        | criminal. 


        |Yeah but after Dorner we need reasons to pick on the LAPD. 


        |And I'm sure the fine officers of the LAPD will be lining up to protest this travesty, and calling for the resignations
        |and prosecutions of the LASD officers involved.


        |Always downvote misleading titles. If everyone does it, none of them will hit the front page.


        |Does that matter for the killed man, or for anyone else in the country sick and tired of the Drug War and police killin

            |it probably matters to the LAPD officers who did not shoot an 80yr old man. facts are facts, the headline is factua

            |It would be rather important for the citizens of LA to know specifically who it is they need to pull out of power.

    |////&gt;“There was a drug operation that was certainly going on in this house,” Whitmore said.////Because finding some pot

        |Not to mention an elderly man with increasingly poor eyesight.. It's as if the medical properties of marijuana could ha

        |Lol by that logic that means meth labs smell very similar to Marijuana. 


        |And they don't specify the amount, which means it was tiny.


    |Yet another example of the police's word against the victim's word, or in this case the victim's loved-one's word because t
    |e victim is dead. **This** is why police should be required to wear cameras at all times when on duty, *particularly* when 
    |aiding a house when civilian witnesses will almost certainly be in short supply and assumed biased. If what they said is tr
    |e, that he pulled a gun on them, it would have corroborated their story. If it was a lie, the negligent or trigger-happy of

    |hat's not to even getting into the absurdity of issuing a warrant based on smell in the first place.


        |Right but where are they going to put a camera? On their body armor? They need those MOLLE hooks for mag pouches, grena

        |n their helmet?  No, they need that space for IR strobe, night vision goggles, thermal goggles, tactical headset, satel

            |lous claims before they can make it to court. Imagine officers thinking twice before they lose their temper and giv
            | civilians actual reasons to complain or sue. From that same article, "Rialto’s police officers also used force nea
            |ly 60 percent less often — in 25 instances, compared with 61. When force was used, it was twice as likely to have b
            |en applied by the officers who weren’t wearing cameras during that shift, the study found" The initial cost of the

    |There is a great, low risk way around this.  Kill water and sewage to the property (prevents flushing evidence).  Secure al

    |door will be answered.  Cautiously but with a great show of force enter the property.  These few principles would save so m
    |ny innocent lives.  Be a cop; not a shock troop.


        |I would only add that each officer should have a camera rolling as well.//// Great post!


            |Thanks!  Just using a little bit of common sense.  Wish more police departments would do that.  These swat teams th

                |How else do they get to live out their war zone fantasies though?


        |Most homes have no way to stop water flow from the outside, only the shut off usually located in the basement. And you 
        |efinitely can't 'kill sewage'. 


            |Also, and this will be my last response, public works will not invade your home to shut off water.  How do you thin
            | they do it?  They do it from the curb.  No home entry needed.


                |FYI for anyone getting their water shut off because their bill is a few days late. They generally don't lock it
                |at first. you can just go and turn it back on.


            |Yes you can- with a curb key.  Most areas with a public water and sewage service have an inlet, and an outlet.  The
            | are usually located near the curb.  They also both have the same valve, and a $12 curb key can shut both of them. 
            |It is how public infrastructure is designed almost anywhere you go.

    |an elder lodging his life. This shit is out of control. If someone wrongfully enters your home while you sleep you have the
    |right to defend yourself. People need to start being held accountable for things like this. 


        |This scenario seems all too common. [A kid I went to school with was fatally shot in a no-knock, very early morning rai
        |.](http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/07/police_identify_man_fatally_sh.html) Nothing ever came out about them
        |finding any drugs, only allegations. He was licensed to posses firearms so the guns weren't illegal either. His girlfri
        |nd later stated that he never pulled a gun and the police literally burst into the room and shot him. Unfortunately peo
        |le in the town never questioned it and devalued her statement because of her drug problems.


            |Damn, I did some work up in Orange a couple summers ago, on Mechanic Street to be exact. That town was very depress
            |ng to say the least.


                |Depressing indeed. But I must say that I feel the area is on the rebound. That being said, you usually hit rock
                |bottom in order to rebound. If you look beyond the blight though, awesome things are definitely occurring. For 
                |xample, there is a great local farm, food, art, and outdoor recreation movement that seems to be changing the m
                |ndsets of many in the area and also attracting outsiders. Just last weekend there was the Garlic &amp; Arts Fes
                |ival which has grown exponentially over 15 years and had a record attendance of several thousand. It has turned
                |into one of the greatest gatherings of people I have experienced- very positive forward thinking mindsets with 
                | focus on local food, art, and culture. I have seen articles in the Boston Globe on Tully Reservoir, mountain, 
                |ampground, disc golf, Doane's Falls and other things in the North Quabbin Region. This has led to a large influ
                | of tourism in recent years. Craft beer seems to be having a positive effect with a store and bar both offering
                |the most unique options in a 35 mile radius- something in addition to the "townie" bars that the area was alway
                | known for. This has attracted several breweries to plan on opening up in the next few years. There is also a c
                |-op in the downtown that will soon have a storefront in a central location. Maybe I am an optimist but I see a 
                |ocal revitalizing revolution occurring; hopefully it continues to do so.


        |Yeah, imagine you have a gun in your room. You are sleeping so you obviously don't hear people yelling "police" outside
        | //////You do hear the door being kicked down and people entering the house and you wake up and pick your gun. Bam! you
        |are dead as soon as you open the door leading to the hallway. 


            |I keep my firearm by my bed. If I hear my door being broken down I would most definitely have time to put accurate 
            |hots down my hallway and I will. My home is my sanctuary. If the police have a warrant and need to search they will
            |be better off knocking and waiting for me than trying to clear my house violently. 


                |Exactly. They don't even have to announce if they get a no knock warrant, so you're sleeping in bed and your do
                |r gets busted down. I'm gonna pull my gun.


                |And then they'll shoot you because you were "violently resisting arrest", "probably a gun smuggler", and "most 
                |efinitely involved in drug operations" because you had some tylenol PM on your bedside table. 


                    |A man was shot in his bed while supposedly reaching for a BB gun on his bed.////I believe it was a no knock
                    |raid, from a legal standpoint there is literally no good outcome for going for your gun when the cops show 
                    |p.//


                        |Yep. Which is completely fucked up in a country where owning guns is legal, and furthermore celebrated.

                |The reason for no knock warrants is to prevent the people with drugs from flushing them down the toilet while t
                |e police are waiting nicely.  The police also wear big vests that say POLICE on them.  You know, so that people
                |can tell they're police.  They also shout things like "POLICE search warrant."////It's about as unsubtle as a r
                |ck. 


                    |O so u have been in a home during a raid? I for one have and at no time did u hear them announce themselves
                    |as police.  It happened so fast I didn't know what was going on.  Had I been in bed with a gun I guarantee 
                    | would have shot a few rounds. Unfortunately everything isn't black and white and you delude yourself if u 
                    |hink it is. 


                    |Yeah as I addressed the loss of evidence is NOT a good enough reason for no knock warrants that result in t
                    |e loss of lives. If they really have drugs like that they can't flush all that evidence and if they do oh w
                    |ll. Get them next time. Have better evidence before you smash their door in. Anything I don't care.


            |I don't think they yell "police" anymore in these cases. In a similar case the other day, the article specifically 
            |aid they avoided identifying themselves on purpose.


            |You don't even need to have a gun to be shot during a raid. Just being there is enough to make a cop jump and pull 
            |is trigger


            |At least if they say police, which is not said in the article


        |If he killed even 1 cop in this illegal raid he would go to jail for life and we wouldn't see a single media outlet cov
        |r it.


            |How is it illegal?  Valid warrant on probable cause.  Or is it illegal just cause "COPS IS PIGS"?


                |It's not illegal. I think people say it's illegal because the probable cause was very questionable. A cop could
                |say any house smelled like drugs and get a search warrant to "legally" search it. That doesn't make it right an
                | it is abusing the law and our rights as citizens.


                |A fucking smell is probable cause?  Are you serious?


                    |well they got a warrant, so it's legal if they follow the rules of the warrant


                        |And now you know what the problem is.


                |It's a shady warrant; smell isn't a universally accepted reason to issue a warrant among the states. The fact t
                |at a simple search turned in to a deadly shooting highlights the problem with lethal force and the 'maximum for
                |e' philosophy is that it is unsuited to many of the police operations (if not all, honestly), and it is hilario
                |sly dangerous for THE CITIZENS THE OPERATIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT (assumed criminals are still citizens) an
                | for the police themselves. Every cop I know has an AR-15 variant in the back of his car. Every cop I know draw
                | his lethal weapon any time he has to touch or order someone else around.//


                |Don't you have to show more than just probable cause in order to get a no knock warrant?


                |Every read the fucking 5th Amendment?


                    |Have you? The 5th Amendment has literally nothing to do with this. 


        |I didn't read the article but was this a "no knock" warrant? Did they just bust in without any warning? If so, I would 
        |e just as dead as that guy probably. I live alone and I sleep with a dog at my feet and a gun in nightstand. If somebod
        | busts in my door or window, at least the first one will be shot. ////Now, if the police did announce their presence, h
        |wever wrongful it is, pulling a gun on them might as well be suicide by cop and the guy shouldn't have done that if he 
        |anted to get out of their alive. That said, if it was in fact no knock, the police that did this should rot in jail for
        |ver with the rest of the criminals. If they did warn him, they still should be barred from law enforcement for life at 
        |he very least. 


            |For shooting somebody pulling a gun on them in the execution of their duties?////"Ok guys, you four are going out t
            | serve the warrant.  If they have a gun, dont shoot them or you're fired, if you get shot, oh well."


                |No, you are assuming that's why they should be punished. They should be punished because they made up a bullshi
                | "probable" cause to get a warrant (if they got a warrant) and an innocent man ended up dead. Warrants should b
                | a sacred thing. Not an impediment for law enforcements' over zealousness and Napoleon complexes. Again, if thi
                | is the case they should lose their job. If there was no warrant, they should be in jail. Their job isn't to vi
                |late the rights of the public. It is to protect the rights of the public. 


                    |First of all, do you even know if the guys who got the warrant are the ones who served them?  Second a judg
                    | deemed it enough cause, a sitting judge.  They took it to him, he decided it was acceptable.  Not law enfo
                    |cement, a judge, somebody elected to office, by the people...  There was a warrant.  He pulled a gun.  Now 
                    |e's dead.


                        |When you pick up a gun and point at it people and threaten them with death, you are responsible for you
                        | actions, regardless of whether or not you wear a blue suit, or a little shiny badge, or a bunch of oth
                        |r people tell you its okay.


                        |A judge granted a warrant on what was presented to him by the officers. And do you know if they knocked
                        |or not? 


                            |Okay, so the judge was also an accessory to this murder.  


                        |Where do you live that you elect judges? AFAIK judges in most places can be voted out, but that is hard
                        |y the same as electing them. Aside from that, warrants are issued with very little concern about the va
                        |idity of the officer's statements. They know they can get away with it because that judge's buddy down 
                        |he hall would be the one on the bench if the warrant was called into question. Who do you think that ju
                        |ge will side with. A broken system does not justify any of these actions. 


        |Pfft, even if you don't pull a gun on the cops it's still a good chance they kill you.  These fuckers make me realize w
        |y the Army trains you on trigger discipline like a motherfucker.  Because these fat cowboys just get a bunch of toys, w
        |tch some COPS, and go raid a house that an informant says has weed, and shoot some innocent people who reach for the li
        |ht switch.


        |“Age does not preclude somebody from being aggressive toward deputies,” Whitmore said. “The lesson here is… don’t pull 
        | gun on a deputy.”////That's the fucking lesson they learned after killing an innocent elderly citizen?. Fuck da police


        |The lesson is get your glasses so you don't miss.


        |No, the lesson is get a stronger door.


        |I don't understand this really. Yes, you have a right to defend your home. But what are the cops going to do? Come back
        |tomorrow, when a drug dealer might just be hiding away? They can't go in without weapons at the ready either, because a
        |yone inside the house might be armed and dangerous. That guy should not have raised a gun towards a police officer. 


            |They could have gotten him when he walked out of his house. They could have knocked and waited. Worst case he barri
            |ades himself in and destroys evidence. But nobody dies. That's what's important. Finding the evidence should be sec
            |ndary to keeping presumed innocent suspects safe and alive. Fuck the police and the idea they can bust up anywhere 
            |hey want. There are safer ways to get what they need than breaking into homes at night. I've done house searches an
            | raids in the military and I know how dangerous they are. The police shouldn't be doing them at the expense of peop
            |e's safety over drugs. I guarantee I will use my firearm to defend my home if unknown assailants come in my home. 


            |So the cops camp out the house for a couple hours, if its worth the tax dollars to stack an entire swat team on 20 
            |ear old kid that moves a couple ounces a week, its worth the tax dollars to keep an unmarked vehicle out there till
            |the guy leaves and then they bust down the door, seize some evidence and send the guy to jail for //selling leaves.


        |The lesson is don't pull a gun on a cop ever. If you raise your gun to a cop hes going to shoot you. This shouldn't eve
        | be here it is classified as retarded.


            |Do you think the man would have shot at the cop if they had knocked and gotten him to the door instead of smashing 
            |n his door while he was asleep and screaming? That's such a jack ass statement.


        |Well, don't pull a gun on cops is still a lesson. You should always identify what you're going to point a gun at before
        |you do, because you don't point your gun at something unless you're okay with shooting it.////It's just far, far from t
        |e biggest lesson here.


            |These kind of things happen quickly, and in a panic.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  I have lived through a home invas
            |on.  I have lived through combat operations where we were kicking doors and clearing houses.  Everything happens qu
            |ck, even though time seems to slow.  I can understand from the home invasion how this man reacted, but from clearin
            | houses I can attest that these officers should have used more restraint.


            |Notice how the victim NEVER gets a shot off at cops when they are massacred. Its because they pause when they see a
            |cop. Do the cops hesitate? No, they blow the victim away and put together a story everyone can agree upon. You can 
            |lso tell how bullshit this story is when they throw in that they found pot in the house. Like that somehow makes it
            |OK.


            |Yes you should identify your target before using deadly force, thats the difference between a rapist forcing a wind
            |w open and your neighbors son trying to sneak in the back of the wrong house while hes drunk.////But public servant
            | should not be performing no knock raids, and expecting people to be cool with it.////Someone who cooks meth may ha
            |e the for thought to put there hands up when they hear a door get kicked in because odds are its the police or a ri
            |al that wants your product.////A law abiding citizen should not have to develop the same response.


    |Now police don't even need to see drugs, only think they smell them, and they barge into your house and shoot you.


        |Which is why I hope some more cops get killed.////It will only be the power-abusing asshole cops that are. Which is a g
        |od thing.////And it will raise awareness to the practices of police, how dangerous they are to themselves and others (e
        |pecially when unjustified), and will probably reinforce the argument for mandatory video cameras on police.////It's a w
        |n all around. And excuse me if I think domestic terrorists with a badge aren't worth crying over if they get killed.


            |Any idea how absurd saying cops need to die in order to change how things are done? First thing that will happen is
            |every moron who believes cops are super heroes will roll over the second a power hungry responsibility lacking cop 
            |ays "we need shoot first warrants because look were being shot and killed".////nobody needs to die, fuckwits need a
            |countability to a higher power not a justification to shoot first ask questions later. ////Some simple surveillance

                |In this case, does it still count as accidental? if not, they have killed way more than that.

                    |No. The number includes all causes and reasons for death. If a police officer pulls someone over and the pe

        |I definitely feel safer amongst some criminals, as long as they're *my* criminals


        |Would you believe me if i told you there is a i.q. cutoff for police officers? ////Not if its too low but if its too hi
        |h. :(


            |&gt;Not if its too low but if its too high.////Well this is just blatantly false.////Especially if we are talking a
            |out LAPD the cutoff for the test score is a 47 (a 77 is a perfect and the lowest I believe is -20)


                |Would too low or too high be more accurate? I'm amenable to that.


                    |Yes, but also you make it sound as if its a law of the land that LEOs can't have high IQs when it was just 
                    |hat department. Turnover rate is too high and so is the cost of training an officer (hundreds of thousands 
                    |f dollars) and they argued that a genius would get bored with boring police work very quickly. 


                        |Ill admit this post got me emotional. Most cops are good cops. But i wouldn't mind more oversight to ca
                        |ch the bad ones. (Such as cameras on all on duty officers)


        |Stay as far away from an American cop as you can get.  They are no better than a regular street gang - they just have b
        |tter paychecks and a better organization.  They'll shoot you for any reason they can think of.  I'd rather walk through
        |Compton than enter a police station.  At least I'd survive the walk through Compton.//


        |To be quite honest, I've unwittingly bumped into a gang at a house where I scored weed earlier in life. I've spooked ga
        |g dudes before and nearly regretted it. Scary right? It's hard to calm down a gang banger down.////Those experiences ar
        | like calm chill moments compared to my petrified emotion with police officers, and the most I've dealt with them is ge
        |ting cuffed once and intimidated. Dude, cops fucking suck. Unlike 'gang members' they are actually purposely malicious 
        |nd rude. A gang member will stay out of your way if you don't scare them or get aggressive, and a cop will fucking shoo
        | you over nothing.////They actually have IQ limitations. The IQ cutoff is like 109 any higher and you are unqualified t

        | by the police department. The police cheif is isolated from the mayor in most cities, and the sociopaths are almost dr
        |wn to police forces. We really have no control over our governments actions. Most voters are so dumb this isn't even an
        |issue in their eyes. Drugs are bad. Crime is bad. Miniorities up to no good. So cops are good! Education in America is

                    |Its still not true though, 109 is not the cutoff. You have to be genius level for them to even consider tha
