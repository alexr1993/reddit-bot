These are the games that sell consoles(/r/gaming.reddit: what's new in gaming)




    |$200 for a regular 3DS? You got ripped off man


        |launch 3DS. bought it as well


            |And then that god damn [price drop....](http://grizzlybomb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Dredd-Fire.gif)


                |Doesn't matter; got all those old games for free.//////^^^I ^^^might ^^^have ^^^got ^^^mine ^^^with ^^^the ^^^p
                |ice ^^^drop ^^^a ^^^day ^^^early ^^^but ^^^I ^^^got ^^^the ^^^games ^^^still


                |That whopping $30.


                    |It was actually $250 to $170. No idea why everyone is confusing the prices.


                        |Ah, I see.////That's a bit more jimmy rustling, I suppose.


                |the glorious price drop so i can pick one up second hand for fuck all


            |You're right, forgot about their initial price. I was more thinking "Just bought a 3DS for $200 to play that new po
            |emon game"


        |If you could get a new 3DS for $200 in NZ you'd be getting a very very good deal. Sigh I wanna live where you live. 


            |Yes, but thanks to the conversion rate, $200 in NZ would be $166 in the US, which would be a deal in the US as well


            |Indeed. I paid $250 for a good quality second hand 3DS and a couple of games and I was thrilled with that. $200 for
            |a brand new one would be insane


        |3DS XL is $200~ now as well :( No point in getting the small one right?


            |Correct. The 3DS XL has better battery life which is pretty much everyones biggest complain about the original 3DS.


            |I just bought the regular one because the XL is fucking gigantic. 


                |Still a bit too small for my giant hands.////Ill get a 2DS some time in the future to help that out.//


                    |Get yourself [one of these](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Assecure-Controller-Attachment-Nintendo-Handheld/dp/B00
                    |BLDTPK), I've got massive hands, makes it much easier to play for more than 20 mins.  ////Makes it easier t
                    | play for 5 hours.  Fuck this, I'm going to get pokemon now.


                |Agreed, and I just don't like the way the XL looks for some reason. And the regular 3DS comes in purple....my f
                |te was sealed. 


                    |I got the purple 


        |Try Australian prices... You guys don't know how lucky you have it in the cheap games department.


            |Yeh I was thinking what 200 how is that ripped off that would be one of the cheaper ones I have seen 


                |I just dropped $300 on a new pokemon version 3dsxl last week. Worth it.


                    |If I had the money I would of got one I'm just looking to get any at this point


            |I felt pretty lucky to buy Pokemon X for $44.


        |lol i paid $300 for a vita on launch day, price dropped to like $150 over here. //Oh well, no regrets, gravity rush was
        |worth that launch price alone. and killzone was fricking amazing (almost as good as killzone 3)


    |Animal Crossing New Leaf too


        |I don't have enough friends


            |Neither do I, that's why you play with strangers on the internet!


        |And Fire Emblem, Mario 3D Land, Paper Mario, NSMB2, Mario Kart 7, Monster Hunter, Sonic: Lost Worlds, Zelda: A Link Bet
        |een Worlds, Smash Bros, Yoshi's Island 3D, Kirby, etc.////There's no reason this should be a Pokemon machine unless you
        |re taste in games is incredibly narrow.


        |I love Nintendo games, I have every system except the Japanese Famicon...////But seriously, fuck Animal Crossing.


    |Get Fire Emblem Awakening, it's a fucking magnificent game.


        |I too bought an expensive pokemon machine.  Why should I buy this? What games is it like? 


            |Pokemon Conquest, Advance Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics.//Strategy RPG, you kind of move your units like chess pieces
            | but far more fun.////It's fucking huge, and has so much customization and replay value. Story is not too bad eithe
            |. Your characters can get married, have children (from the futureeeeee), and have a pair up feature.//Try the demo,
            |it's amazing.////^^^^Plus ^^^^Tharja ^^^^is ^^^^fucking ^^^^hot.////Edit: Typo, and if you do pick it up why not co
            |e over and look at /r/fireemblem? Kind of small, but an amazing sub.


                |Back off, Tharja is my wife.


                    |And she is 18% of male avatar's wives.////Following behind is Lucina at 12%, and Coredelia at 10%.


                        |*adjusts hipster glasses* I married Lissa on my first playthrough, married to Miriel currently, Laurent
                        |is Lucina's current husband.


                |is it kind of like yu-yu-hakishow game for gameboy?


                |Final Fantasy Tactics*////Best game ever created.


                    |Advanced wars 2


                    |little oversell there. great game but come on.


                        |No really, the story was immersive, deep and complex ////The graphics were great (for their time)////An
                        |unprecedented level of customization in your party////**THE CLASS SYSTEM AKA BEST THING EVER**////I've 
                        |et to see a game even come close to the feel of that game (gameplay), even its sequels couldn't do it./
                        |//**The most beautiful OST I've ever heard.**  Nothing compares.  The only game whose soundtrack I know
                        |better than the dialog.////**The God damn class system**////And lastly **CLASS SYSTEM**.////PS **OST**/
                        |//^^^I ^^^may ^^^have ^^^a ^^^slightly ^^^unhealthy ^^^obsession ^^^with ^^^this ^^^game.


                            |Well, there's two reasons.


                |I think Tactical RPG is the term.


                    |SRPG is more common, but Tactical RPG is probably more accurate.


            |Played the demo last night and while it's not my type of game I'd definitely recommend it if you like strategy rpg'
            | like Advance Wars. ////The demo is available in the nintendo shop or whatever you call it.


            |If you are into Zelda they have a game for the 3ds. 


            |this is not my type of game and i had fun. it's turn based strategy. you choose when to battle or advance the story
            |with the push of a button, there is also no time constraint of any way in the game mechanics. this lends to a game 
            |echanic that complements superbly with a portable system without sacrificing the plot because each plot development
            |is a self-contained scene just ready whenever you are. you can pick it up and turn it off at a moment's notice.


            |Isn't there a Nintendo DS emulator for Windows? I've played Wii on PC as well, Heck I played Super Mario 64 once on
            |a PC.


                |Not 3DS


                    |I'm assuming that is fixable by purchasing a 3D PC monitor, but I'm not sure if this method works.


                        |Not 3DS as in no 3DS emulators have been successfully created yet.


                            |Is pokemon black one a ds or 3ds game then? Because I can run black on my emulator, I used it to tr
                            |de pokemon from my white version on 3ds to evolve pokemon. I know I had to use my sons ds to trade 
                            |ith white 2 tho.


                                |Black is a DS game.


                                    |I thought that must have been the difference between version one and two and being able to 
                                    |rade from the emulated version.


                        |I feel like you don't understand that the 3DS is an entirely different console.


                        |No, as in not the 3DS. The DS can be emulated, however the 3DS cannot be emulated at this time (in 3D o
                        | 2D).


                        |No, the 3DS hasn't been cracked and can not be emulated, 2D or not. 


                        |A 3DS is not a DS with a 3D screen. A 3DS, for all intents and purposes, is a "next gen" of handheld ha
                        |dware in comparison to the DS. Better graphics, more powerful games, you know, all the trimmings.////Th
                        |re is no 3DS emulator.


        |This was my first experience with the Fire Emblem series...seriously, get it.


        |Also, Zelda: Ocarina of Time. ////It was great for the N64, even better for the 3DS.


        |Did you play Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon for DS? If so how does Awakening compare to it?


            |Personally, Fire Emblem: Awakening is the best Fire Emblem game, in fact, I'd say it's the best turn-based strategy
            |game I've played.////Not as deep as Civ V, but every bit as addictive, with a fantastic storyline blended in.


            |Its a lot better.  Shadow Dragon isn't actually considered a good Fire Emblem by its fans.  The reasons why is beca
            |se in the GBA versions, we had social links which are fucking amazing and give us so much depth and story to the ch
            |racters.////Shadow Dragon is a port of the very first one, and doesn't have the social link game mechanic.  ////Fir
            | Emblem: Awakening is just such a good game.  You really get to love the characters.


            |Only English releases I have not played are Shadow Dragon and Path of Radiance.////Shadow Dragon is considered the 
            |orst in the series by fans.//Since you have to kill some units if you want to recruit particular ones, so you canno
            | recruit everyone in one save file.


                |Damn I enjoyed Shadow Dragon. Guess I should definitely pick up Awakening if Shadow Dragon is considered the wo
                |st, thanks for the response.


        |Die, with magnificence!


            |And then reset so you don't lose your favorite character!


            |Pick a god and pray!


    |i can wait til after chirstmas when the 2ds will be ~100 and the game will be 30. i *really* want it, but at this point i'd
    |rather pass my classes.


        |Keep fighting the good fight.


    |What about Rune Factory 4 and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate?


        |Always room for more Rathalos huntin.


            |no pl8, abandon hunt.


                |alat plz


        |I briefly tried the Monster Hunter 3 demo on the 3DS but couldn't really dig the controls.////My favorite game of all t
        |me is Dark Souls, and some comparisons have been made between the two.  Obviously they're not exactly alike, but people
        |urged that they had the same skill-based combat.////Again, though, in the short time I tried MH3 I could not get the 3D
        | (XL) controls to respond in a 3d environment in a way that I thought would be responsive enough for such a skill-based
        |game.////This was a rant that is partially "just my 2 cents" and partially "does anyone have an argument why this isn't
        |the case?"


        |I have a really hard time understanding the appeal of Monster Hunter.  I've always been curious about the Rune Factory 
        |ames, though.  Is it worthwhile to play from the beginning or should one just jump in on the latest game?


            |It's not hard to understand. It's a game where everything depends on your own skill rather than trivial gear check.
            |Also you make your shit out of part of slain monsters. It's not for everyone, but appeal is pretty clear. 


    |Pokemon, Zelda, &amp; Mario Machine.


        |And upcoming Smash Bros machine. So many great games


            |Don't forget monster hunter, such a fun game


        |And if we're lucky, Metroid too!


            |All I want out of life is at least one more side scrolling Metroid. 


                |Something like Metroid: Fusion, that game was perfect.


                    |Zero Mission. All the gameplay, more tweaks, and a faster overall feel. Loved every moment of it. I'd perso
                    |ally settle for a 2.5D, since the tech is there and almost nobody is using sprites, plus, it'd give somethi
                    |g extra to the people who can stand the 3D without migraines.


                    |Fusion is like Super Metroid on crack. Great game, doesn't get a lot of fanfare because it was a GBA game I
                    |guess.


        |I bought it for Paper Mario. Man was I disappointed. Very happy ill have something good to play tomorrow. 


            |I was so looking forward to that game, but when I basically read that it's nothing like the thousand year door I no
            |ed straight out of that decision


        |Oh the Mario titles. I didn't get my 3DS until this past July and stores had about 5 Mario games. It was hard to choose
        |..


    |it's Phoenix Wright for me. Bought the 3ds and just waiting


        |If Maya doesn't make an appearance I'll just die


    |Exactly what I did... Blew through $350 for one and 2 games. To play while waiting for the new pokemon to come out. 


        |Ouch that's expensive. Do you mean 250$?


    |This and the Ace Attorney Professor Layton crossover game.


        |Is it good?


            |Not out in English yet. Game uses language a lot, I bet they're still translating it.////It was well received in Ja
            |an, Critics loved the soundtrack and complimenting gameplay, but felt they relied too much on new / uninteresting c
            |aracters (subjective if interesting or not) rather than the crossover for the bulk of the game.


    |I'm actually thinking about buying a Wii-U just for the Wind Waker HD remake. 


        |That's what I did! Even though I probably should have waited until I finished GTAV. But totally worth it IMO.


    |fire emblem ur welcome


    |Yeah I think I've spent maybe a few hours total playing the other video games I have for my DSi, other than that it's been 
    |00% pokemon soul silver.


    |You can easily get $100 Pokemon machines on ebay.  I even was able to find one that came in purple.


    |There are a bunch of great games for 3DS.....if you think pokemon is the only one you are mistaken.....


        |nope you are the one who is mistaken


    |I never had a normal DS. I bought a 3DS a couple months ago, the entry price was worth it for all the used games I can play
    |now.////...I'm just starting pokemon Diamond version. I'll see you X and Y types in 10 years or so.


        |http://xkcd.com/606/


            |[Image](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cutting_edge.png)////**Title:** Cutting Edge////**Alt-text:** I remember trying
            |to log in to the original Command and Conquer servers a year or two back and feeling like I was knocking on the boa
            |ded-up gates of a ghost town.


                |You, sir, are the best bot I've seen.


        |Diamond? Shiiiit.////Heart Gold and Soul Silver is where its at.


        |The last Pokemon game I played was red/blue when I was 8. 


    |Me too even though it cost me my Xbone :(////worth it


    |I'm waiting for Shin Megami Tensei IV to release here in Europe before I get mine...


    |I would've bought one for Mega Man Legends 3.... :(


        |I wish I could have the knowledge that that game was ever in development erased from my memory. Its like Capcom dug out
        |a place in my heart and then just left it empty.


    |See, this is why there isnt a proper pokemon game on wii-u, nintendo portables are what they are because of some games, nin
    |endo consoles are what they are because of other. Mixing things not always work.//That said!//DUDE! There are lots of other
    |awesome games for 3DS, check them out to make your money worth(ier).


        |That's part of the reason, but it's mainly because handhelds are much more popular in Japan, and the gameplay and tradi
        |g aspect of pokemon has always suited handhelds. It always bothers me when people ask why there isn't a game on a conso
        |e - "But, but, it would sell SOOO MUCH!!"////Yeah, like the normal pokemon games don't, at a *fraction* of the cost, an
        | they can make *TWO* versions of the same game? No console game could ever compete with that.////Not  to mention the fa
        |t that it's called Pocket Monster - you keep the game with you much like you would your pokemon. It's all part of the e
        |perience. Game design isn't always limited to what you see on the screen, user experience starts with how you approach 
        |he gameplay.


    |Playstation - Gran turismo console  (for me, since i think there is no competition for this game as drive simulation)


        |Last of us, uncharted, LBP, god of war and it's not as if you can't play any if the other big games like GTA...


        |No. Sony has way more exclusives than Microsoft.


    |It's ok, I bought my XBOX 360 for the sole purpose of playing Sonic Generations on it. No regrets.////Then i discovered Min
    |craft...


    |well u can get a 3ds cheap now mine costed 75 just go craigslist or something


    |Should have gotten the 2ds. $170 for the console and game.


        |Can confirm, wonderful price, just wish I didn't have to wait for shipping times. Tuesday, I'll be back near this subre
        |dit. Probably not a moment sooner.


    |I got lucky and won a 3DS in a raffle at a folf tournament I played in yesterday.  I went to Gamestop and picked up Pilot W
    |ngs (fond memories of playing that for N64) and some other game the guy recommended for $10.  I'm going to go grab Pokemon 
    | tomorrow!


        |They have pilot wings on that!? That was my first gamr on the n64. Is it any good on the 3ds?


            |Yeah I think it was a launch title but I could be wrong. It's not the same one that was on N64 but it's the same co
            |cept/gameplay. It uses Mii's as the characters. For $10 it's great!


    |This is actually the entire reason I got out of pokemon after gen 2. Each their own I guess. 


    |I'm considering a Wii U for this same idea...Nintendo's got some good ongoing IPs (and a few new ones it seems). If they re
    |eased a new Zelda title I'd buy it in a heartbeat. 


    |I bought mine purely for a 12 hour Monster Hunter road trip to Capcom HQ.////I never touch it now.


    |Did the exact same thing. Hey! At least we have a Super Smash Bros. coming out soon


    |I too succumbed to the cancer of supporting 3D games...////Even though using the 3D gives me such a migraine i've turned it
    |off in the parental controls.////And I was stupid enough to but the £180 one with the box mascots upside down on the front 
    |f it.////


    |Better call it "200$ Nintendo first party games machine"!


    |I bought a 3DS almost entirely as a Animal Crossing and nostalgia N64-remakes player.


    |I bought it for Fire Emblem, Harvest Moon, and Monster Hunter.////The last of which I'm kind of meh about but I'm sure I'll
    |eventually get through it.


    |God I wish I could do that.  My friend and I only have one 3DS between us, and we just picked a digital copy of X up and tw
    | memory cards so we could both have our own save game.  Unfortunately, they made the game specifically so you couldn't do t
    |at, and if you tried you'd have to wipe one of the cards.////I wish I could afford to get myself an XL and let my buddy pla
    | the 3DS regular with pokemon X.


    |It's nothing new, Sonic sold about 10 million MegaDrives (genesisisisis...) when he was introduced


    |I also bought a 3DS XL for Pokemon alone. Then I found out about Fire Emblem Awakening, Mario Kart 7 and Animal Crossing Ne
    | Leaf.


    |paid 155euro


    |I did the same thing except it was a $200 'Ocarina if Time' machine. 


    |180 for a pokemon/zelda machine


    |Fun fact: I bought a 3DS XL yesterday but I'm not even going to get Pokemon.


    |Just so you know, there's a PokéDex in the eShop...


    |Last console I bought was a Wii. Sure, I wanted Mario Kart and Mario Party, but they didn't get me to buy a whole system. /
    |//What did? Punch Out. Once in a blue moon there is a title you absolutely have to have. ////My NES was my third parent. Pu
    |ting out a goddamn Punch Out title was a pressure point strike to my nostalgia. 


    |So did I. I feel complete now


    |monster hunter, animal crossing, zelda, fire emblem, super mario and so much more


    |Monster Hunter has shifted many nintendo handhelds off the shelves in Japan.


    |In 4 short hours I'll be buying the first day release $130 2ds, for pokemon


    |I bought a 400$ Halo 3 machine a few years back, no regrets. 


    |Yeah, but you can always buy other great games for it.////I bought a £200 Japanese 3DS to play Monster Hunter 4 and I don't
    |plan on getting any other games for it.


    |Ya.. I bought mine on the day the price dropped and the ambassador program ended.... I got both :D


    |I searched in eBay for 3 weeks leading up to the release of this game. Proud to say I bought one yesterday for $160 and I b
    |ught Pokemon today. I bought a $160 Pokemon machine


    |I'm buying a 3ds XL on monday just for pokemon. //But then when I have a 3ds XL I'll also buy animal crossing, fire emblem 
    |nd maybe super mario 3ds. So yeah, Pokemon will cost me around $350 - $400


    |Fire Emblem, Pokemon, Animal Crossing, Mario kart, A link between worlds


    |I bought a £105 Animal Crossing machine (3DS XL) I was pretty happy with that price.


    |Just like my Wii U! $350 wait........um.........Zelda remake machine?


    |I loved silver and even..sapphire or whatever. The new ones look so weird and flashy compared to them.


    |I did the same but originally for Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance. Wonderful game and i've played through it many times,
    |but until today that's been the only game played. I also did the same for Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep on the PSP. I speci
    |lly went out to buy a Nintendo DS for Kingdom Hearts 358/2 but since then I've bought numerous DS titles, being mainly Poké
    |on and Kingdom Hearts games.////////I enjoy the Kingdom Hearts series...


    |I bought a $160something fire emblem machine and I hat is this. 


    |Haha, no you didn't, mate. You bought a $200 Nintendo handheld, which pretty much guarantees you're totally set for portabl
    | games for another generation.////Check this out: http://imgur.com/r/gaming/KT9StaN


    |So basically people are buying the 3DS near launch and completely ignoring all the great games that have been released sinc
    |?


    |Buy used on eBay. Sometimes they even have games and eShop credit too!


    |I haven't played a Pokemon game since Yellow. Or maybe it was gold. Should I get back into it??


    |Pokemon, Fire Emblem, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies, Virtues Last Reward.////I got
    |a good amount out of my 3DS, not just pokemon.


    |i also got a pkmn machine and x


    |Same here...


    |I just read that as "I Bought A Zoo".


    |I might buy one... or just hang myself. I dunno, whichever comes first.


    |funny, my kids have about 12 DS games and not one of them is pokemon


    |This is what I did, Pokemon is the only game I have for it. 


    |Monster hunter is awesome,////Also males an excellent rolling desk....


    |I did that with the gameboy advance, and that Pokemon was shit.  Never falling for it ever again.


    |Super Smash Bros.


    |Phoenix wright, fire emblem, new Zelda, new SSB.////I'm finally getting a 3DS.  It was well worth the wait. 


    |But...but...Dragon Quest...


    |What?! Are you telling me you don't want to get the forth remake of ocarina of time or that shitty pilot wings game!? Well 
    |ickle me pink 


        |You wish! Pink puzzle pieces are hard to get.


    |I'd by lying if I said "I haven't done that 3 times (Red, Silver, Platinum) and I'm not planning to do it for Y."////It sti
    |l is probably the saddest thing ever. Right up there with drowning a bag full of puppies that Santa Clause was delivering t
    | orphans of a city-wide fire. 


        |The 3ds library is small, but there is almost no bad games on the system. Fire Emblem Awakening, Monster Hunter, Pheoni
        | Wright x Professor Layton. I suggest you pick some of them up, because the 3DS honestly is an incredible console


    |130$ 2DS just came out =D


    |Lol bro you could have just bought a 2ds for $130 so much more cheaper if its only going to be used for just pokemon games.
    |Which is exactly what im doing later in the morning picking me up a 2ds with pokemon y.


        |Umm... Pokemon X and Y only run on the 3DS.


            |The 2DS is a cheaper, 3D-less version of the 3DS. http://www.dvice.com/sites/dvice/files/styles/blog_post_media/pub

    |Resident Evil: Revelations 


    |But.. the PS VITA is a far superior system.. HAHAHAHA!


    |EMULATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


    |The day pokiemon is better then fire emblem will bet the day I quite gaming...seriously fucking pokiemon...


        |Tell us about the day you quit English.


    |Alright guys here is a tip. GET GATEAWAY3DS. Its like the old flashcard used in normal ds for example r4. Its the ONLY one 
    |hat currently runs most(if not all) 3DS roms. It cost $80 so not that much assuming single game sells at 60. The only downs
    |de is you gotta reload the game if you wanna play a different one, the old flashcard for normal 3ds allowed multiple storag
    |.


    |I wish Nintendo would stop being so stingy with their exclusives. Oh you want the next game in one of our popular franchise
    |? Well have fun buying &lt;Insert gimmicky console&gt;. Some day in the future I'll be playing Super Mario on my Playstatio
    | 7


        |All consoles need exclusives to sell. That would be like asking Microsoft to give up Halo, or Sony to give up Uncharted
        |or the Last of Us.


            |The problem is Nintendo consoles are loaded with exclusives. Sony and Microsoft have been backing away from exclusi
            |ity. 


                |You're kidding, right? Sony has butt loads of exclusives! Uncharted, Ratchet and Clank, Gran Turismo, Last of U
                |, God of War, Little Big Planet, PS All Stars I guess, Infamous and many more! Even Microsoft has Halo, Gears o
                | War, and a few others. So Nintendo ain't alone on exclusives bro.


                    |You're right, I should've realized that Playstation All-Stars is on the same level as Pokemon or Kirby. Peo
                    |le are really going to be missing out if they don't but a playstation for PS all stars.


                        |I said Playstation All Stars *I guess*. But you are proving my point, there is a market for these games
                        | so people still buy the consoles for the games, so unless no one buys them and they don't make money, 
                        |hey will continue with consoles.


    |I went to buy one today, lying sacks of shit said they were out.  I saw my friend open 2 boxes of pokemon x and y. 


        |They were probably preorders.


            |I had a preorder card. I bought it right before midnight ;)//


        |Why would they lie about that? Don't you think they want to sell games not keep them in a big pile?


    |cant you just download a nds/3ds/gba emulator onto a smartphone...


        |There are no 3DS emulators, it hasn't even been hacked for homebrew yet...


        |No 3DS emulators yet.


    |Should a bought a nvidia shield, then for 8 bucks the best ds emulator app, and now u can play ds and everything else with 
    |his device. Ds is pointless to own now short of 3d. 


        |What about X and Y? They're 3DS exclusives. Also I'm pretty sure emulators can't use features such as GTS, that weird p
        |dometer thingy for HGSS, or Dream World.////I guess you're not aware that the DS and 3DS are different consoles?


        |I don't think you understand. The 3ds is not a DS with 3d on it, It's a whole new console. A DS Emulator won't do anyth
        |ng, that's like saying the Gameboy Advance is just a fancy gameboy, it doesn't quite work like that.


    |If you bought a $200 pokemon machine, you're a fucking idiot...  


        |Don't worry. It's not literally a Pokemon machine. I hear it has Netflix.
