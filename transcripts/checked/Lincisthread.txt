    |Holy shit that was funny. Well done to whoever made this.


        |It's a group called Magic Hugs

            |Hi....hi......hi I'm Ronny nishimoto and this is fitness with the stars


        |Here is the actual video, way funnier with sound!  //http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxK05rOmOZw


            |Thanks for posting it, but I'll have to disagree, I don't think it was really funnier.


                |Really? Not even the mom yelling "GO! GO! GO!" ?


                |It's "look at this douchebag!" funny, if you like that kind of humor.


                |Edit: and yet yes it was


        |I believe it was College Humor or Funny or Die////edit: no it wasn't


            |It was actually Magic Hugs


            |I remember when funny or die wasn't a piece of shit. Those were good times.//


                |Yes, yes, every popular place to find funny stuff is crap.


                    |/r/funny is crap, so...


                        |pahroof there it is!


                        |I think you mean the whole of reddit is crap


                    |Why is it always the "in" thing to hate things that are popular? How do y'all have the energy for that much
                    |hate?


                        |because I want to be a sith lord as soon as possible


                            |Hate leads to suffering.


                            |Yo, can I buy some absolutes? I hear you got 'em cheap.


                        |The reason for that is pretty simple. A lot of things get popular because it is funny due to some unexp
                        |ctedness or similar. This only lasts for the first couple of time though. A user who browses reddit a t
                        |n will quickly get fed up with that content and it will then be very annoying for them to see it again 
                        |nd again because it has lost any value of entertainment. As time goes on more and more people will get 
                        |ed up while a large amount of users are casuals who don't browse sites like this all day long.////For e
                        |ample look at the Harlem Shake. Once you've seen a couple you have seen them all.

                                |People also hate "wrong" decisions getting rewarded. There's near-universal agreement amongst a
                                |yone with an iota of literary interest or experience that Twilight is shit, but it mercilessly 
                                |rushes thousands of better works in sales. The fact that people with casual interest in somethi

                                |s very frustrating to those people.////And in fairness to them they're right that, statisticall
                                |, those people would probably hate Twilight if they read more of other works. But apparently it
                                |s very popular with people who read very casually so. It is what it is.////I mean I drink Black

                                    |That's a line of thinking I can logically understand, thanks for the explanation, friend!


                                        |I hate fungi that take over nervous systems. FUCKING CLICKERS, MAN.

    |Old, fake, and very funny.


    |And the funny thing is Cavic won that, omega later admitted that they made a mistake.


    |This is great!


    |I've been looking for this gif for ages, thanks op!


    |Obviously didn't swim in high school and learn manners.


    |Yeah Magic Hugs!

    |An old acquaintance of mine grew up in the same town as him. Apparently he's a real ass.


        |The Olympics also had a powerful resonance for the Hansen family, who live in the Baltimore suburb of Timonium and firs
        | came in contact with Phelps in the fall of 2002. Stevie Hansen, then seven, was a promising age-group swimmer who was 
        |acing surgery to remove a brain tumor. Through Bowman the family asked if Stevie could meet his idol, and the day befor
        | the surgery Phelps went to the Hansens' house. He and Stevie shot hoops in the driveway and compared their favorite ju
        |k foods. After the operation, while Stevie was recovering in the hospital, Phelps sent balloons and a basket of delicio
        |sly unhealthy treats. The next summer Phelps surprised Stevie by showing up at one of his swim meets, and the boy raced
        |across the pool deck to leap into his hero's arms. Phelps later borrowed a suit and swam the anchor leg in a parents-an

        |Agreed :)

    |Omg I could not stop laughing at this, great job to the makers of this! Funniest thing I've seen in a long time. 


    |Thanks, Bush Jr!

    |League of Legends?


    |I know this was made but duuuude, I'm just never going to look at Phelps the same.again.////Time to share:


    |Despite being years later, I still think that Cavic should have won that race. ////Any image of the last few milliseconds b
    |fore impact show Cavic far closer than Phelps. Judges probably just wanted to be part of history. //


        |They have sensor plates that the swimmers touch, judges don't call it.


        |Aside from the sensor plates water greatly distorts vision.////[here's an example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature
        |player_embedded&amp;v=iNdBHmZAOr4#t=193) of just how bad water distortion can be...


            |Refraction does not apply when both the [subject and the camera are in the same medium.](http://graphics8.nytimes.c
            |m/images/blogs/olympics/phelpscavic533.jpg)


                |To be fair I didn't understand which angle you were talking about. I assumed you meant that the camera was out 
                |f the water looking down.////Also it looks like these shots are taken using a wide angle lens from a decent dis
                |ance away. I say this because the edge of the pool has a curved look [like so](http://www1.arielnet.com/Main/im
                |ges/fig1a.gif), this could explain what appears to be an optical illusion of Cavic being closer than Phelps. (E
                |IT:) Going back I want to also note that Cavic appears to be coasting the whole way while Phelps is giving one 
                |ast stroke.////Another big thing about those images is that the camera does not appear to be tight against the 
                |all. It would help if we had that for contrast, or so we could see their fingers in relation to the wall better
                | but in this case it is at a very strange angle. It doesn't help that there is a lot of surface motion and over
                |xposure coming from above.////If you ask me this camera angle is nothing but a novelty for the home viewers to 
                |ee their swimmers in a unique way.


    |Funny as hell


    |The only thing that could make this better would be if the first thing he did after finishing the lap was toke his bong.


    |My god, how I wish this were real.


    |Geez, bro, chill out. You should smoke a bowl.


    |I didn't believe it until I saw George W. Bush cheering on someone being drowned.

    |As a swimmer, Im flip-turning of the wall laughing, or ftowl. It's the new rofl.


        |That will never be the new rofl, mainly because no one uses rofl anymore.


            |I now understand that my joke was bad. I'm sorry you had to see that
