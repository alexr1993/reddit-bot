    |As another tall dude, this is how most of my conversations with people go.

        |as a 5'5'' man, there's only so many Frodo jokes you can take before you want to kill everyone...

        |As a 4'11 girl, I empathise. Sometimes even my really good friends just look at me out of the blue and go, "holy fuck, you're short
        |cunttastic". Thank you. Yes I was previously unaware.

        |six foot six checking in. everytime I would stand up in class someone would say, "I never realized you were so tall" it backfired w
        |en I wrote about it for a creative writing project, and my teacher said, "huh, I never thought you were tall enough for people to t
        |ll"

        |As a shortish dude, let me apologize on behalf of my kind.  It is hard to comprehend that a normal, living person can be existing i
        |side a body so very tall.  The grotesquely different size of the whole thing is just utterly disjarring to me, most of the time.  I
        |do not mean to make you feel bad about it, and if I annoy you, again, sincerely, I apologize.

        |I answer daily whether or not I play basketball.  I help old women get grocery items from the top shelf all the time.  I also have 
        |any scars on my head, and pants that I sag so that they don't look like high-waters.  This is my tall life.

        |I got sick and tired of strangers asking me "Wow how tall are you?" so now I just tell everyone who asks my height in centimeters. 
        |'m American so people are expecting the 6'6" answer...priceless.

        |ID: c4b4rv1, Author: ElDiabloGringo
        |As a guy that is 6'10, I try to just stay at home as much as possible to avoid those exact situations.

        |I'm tall, also Justin!

        |ID: c4b35yy, Author: Sevicks
        |Completely agree, I'm 6'6, and most conversations always start with, "Wow, you're tall."

    |How does it feel gaining more comment karma for this single comment than your 3 month redditing career?
