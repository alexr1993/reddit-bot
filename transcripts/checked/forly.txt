    |I am unable to comprehend how someone can be SO bad at this.

            |Yes. You need to cut the wheel (completely) BEFORE you start moving! It's not rocket surgery.

                |That's called dry steering and it really cuts down the life of your tires. At my EVOC (emergency vehicle operat
                |ons course) they do not allow you to do this, and we are maneuvering fire engines, ambulances and patrol cars a
                |ound some really tight places. You should always have rolling friction when you turn the wheel. It might be eas
                |er to do it while you are stopped, but it is not good for the tires.


                    |The curb weight of an average, mid-size sedan is 3.5k lbs.////A fire truck weighs ~30k-70k lbs.////While dr
                    | steering is never good for tyres, I imagine it's a whole lot worse for some of the larger rescue vehicles.


                        |This goes the same for patrol cars, which are less than 5k pounds.


                            |It's a matter of standards in training for motor vehicle operation. As we've both noted, it's not g
                            |od for the tyres, so it should not be a well-practiced maneuver regardless of vehicle type.////But 
                            |ealistically it won't cause any significant amount of wear on the lighter patrol sedan's tyres, eve

                |Except in extremely tight spots, you should be moving before turning the wheels. Otherwise it's bad for the tir
                |s, since you're just grinding one part against the pavement. 


                    |I've heard it said, but no proof.  Tires are designed to take an awful lot of pavement contact.////I've nev
                    |r seen tires with a flat ground into them from turning while stopped.    Never noticed a black spot on the 
                    |avement from the "grinding rubber", either.


                        |The black spots were more obvious on our concrete driveway when I was trying to flag my dad back to hoo
                        | up the boat when he already had the camper on. Black swirly spots everywhere 


                            |As swirls from moving, yes, I see those.  But I don't see a much blacker spot where a person turned
                            |the wheel in one place.


                    |People should learn to drive in a car without power steering.  It makes a huge difference.  You learn to do
                    |things like begin the return swing on the wheels just before you come to a stop in a 3-point turn.  Teachin
                    | my other half to do this in her giant truck made her life so much easier when it came to tight maneuvers.


                        |I was taught to do this all the time even though my instructor's car *had* power steering. Makes sense 
                        |or them to teach it this way given that most people's first car is a beaten up old thing.


                    |I don't know how often you end up in these tight spots, but the amount of times that I need to do this woul
                    | have a neglible effect on my tires. I guess if you're doing it often that this is a consideration.


                        |If it's just once in a while, it's not a big deal, and tires will wear out eventually in any case. I ju

                                    |w. This was my initial thought and made pretty much no sense. //Because it assumes that the

        |It was actually painful to watch. It hurt so much I had to fast forward.


        |I would love to go on a first date and re-enact this parking strategy. 


        |I just had a flashback: I'm nine, and my six-year-old sister is playing Super Mario Land on my gameboy.////NO THAT'S NO
        | HOW YOU DO IT GIMME IT I'LL SHOW YOU GIMME IT!


        |I can only assume she was stressed out of her mind after this first few problems.


        |I think this person was as stoned as a goat.


        |Because the video is staged.


        |To be fair it looks like half the people parked like shit there too.


        |it looked like their wheels wouldn't turn to the right. Only to the left. At one point in the video you can see them tu
        |n the wheels hard right and the wheels only straightens up.////I'm no mechanic but I wouldn't drive that thing


        |I drive an F250. I am with you completely. I dont understand how people are so goddamned bad at operating a motor vehic
        |e.


        |The guy drives like I do for Christ's sake, and I don't drive.


        |what i can't comprehend that somebody who's obviously VERY VERY VERY VERY BAD at doing even the most basic stuff with h
        |s/her car even got a licence.////Then i remember.. a lot of countries give them away with a carton of milk.. and then t
        |ey wonder why they have so many fatalities on the roads..


        |What puzzles me more is how he/she managed to park the car in the first place. 


        |The best part is that there's two shitty drivers in that parking lot. Watch the station wagon.


        |They are bad at it because they are a woman.


        |Well in all fairness. If we look at how everyone else couldn't park worth a damn and how the parking lot was designed..
        |.never mind...it's all bad.


        |No power steering and probably a manual.//EDIT: It's not an excuse, but makes things plausible.  Otherwise, dude's trip
        |in' balls.


            |I dont understand how that can be an excuse at all.


            |Yeah, I had to drive a truck when I was in highschool that had no powersteering and was a manual. It's a bit more w
            |rk but still doable, you just need to be moving a bit when you try turning the wheel.


    |Ah the go-to, 145-point turn. Classic.


        |it was hard to watch


            |it made me hard watching it


            |I made it a minute before i realized i was yelling at my phone.


    |This was painful to watch.


        |It got really painful when the second car decided to wait for the first one to drive out. 


            |Because now there's 2 people involved in this catastrophe.


            |I would have waited, too. They were probably laughing too hard to drive away.


        |I found it quite enjoyable. The music made it quite sublime. ////Would definitely watch again while hungover


            |I thought it was great to watch at about an [8] on a rainy Saturday afternoon.


            |I think it would have been better with the Austin Powers theme playing.

        |Can you make a comparison diagram for the video with all 25 points?//haha


        |What would you have done if there was a car parked in the parallel parking spot? 


        |And she was *soooooo* fucking close right at the beginning!


        |*Maybe* 4 if she couldn't clear the jeep on the first reverse. Pull forward and to the left a bit, straight back, and o
        |t. 


    |Kinda impressed they didn't hit anything with all that fidgetting around. 


    |Why were none of the cars parked within the lines? 


        |I sometimes have to park outside of the lines because everyone else is parked like that when i get there, and then they
        |all go away and i'm the only one parked like that and everyone thinks i'm an asshole :(

            | assholey.


        |I actually thought that's how the parking lots work wherever it is.


    |What's the deal with the woman in the black car? She backs up and then goes back to the parking space and just waits for th
    | whole ordeal with the blue car.


        |She probably thought "I'll let this person get out, it'll only be a moment" and by the time she realized the person was
        |void of any rational thought she had already committed to being polite.


            |And committed suicide 


                |That would be two videos I have watched today where someone commits suicide.


            |And finished a game of risk. And had a successful career. Had grandchildren and retired. And watched the Sun go sup

                |You know why that piece of skin who watched the end of the Earth was such a bitch?////She had to watch this wom
                |n try to exit the parking lot the whole time.


        |With that level of crazy going on behind you, you don't wanna be anywhere near it.


            |You also want to get your car away from that mess before you get rammed.  


                |Or you could be witness to that level of crazy ramming into another car and have it properly reported.


        |It looks like she tries to back out twice and has the same level of intelligence as the woman in the blue car. 


            |I just think it's funny how everyone is assuming that both are women. ////Edit: rewatched it, saw them get in. Yep,
            |women,  but I found myself thinking that before I Actually saw them. 


                |Watch the video again.... they are both women, no assumptions. 


                |Probably because we watched the video and saw the women get into the cars?


            |I'm guessing that this is the staff parking lot at a nursing home or something. ////Source: I used to look after th

        |i imagined her sitting in her car trying not to laugh.


            |I did this the other day at my son's school. Person in a giant SUV trying to parallel park. I got to sit there and 
            |atch the entire ten minute ordeal finish with parking half on the curb and furtive glances to see if anyone noticed
            | I gave her a thumbs up.


                |I was on a 1 lane road through campus with a huge white construction barrier to the left and an escalade tried 
                |o parallel park in a spot small enough for a fiat 500.  After that failed she pulled forward and put on her bli
                |ker and sat blocking a line of 40 cars while she waited for a spot to open.


            |Or starving to death. 


        |I know!  I would have gotten out of my car and asked the driver if they wanted ME to turn their car around!  I'm patien
        |, but that was crazy.  She should have kept going and gotten out of there when she had the chance.  Unreal........


        |I would have sat back and enjoyed the show. Might have got out and openly laughed at them if it was obvious it wasn't a
        |learner driver or an old person or something.


        |Probably laughing too hard to drive.  


    |But they never touched another car! Perfect exit a parking! 


        |Whatever you say, person featured in the video.


        |I gotta hand it to her, she knows *exactly* how long her car is.

        |Jumping onto the top comment to say, save yourself and the person patiently waiting in the other spot some time. If you

            |Art.


            | I dunno about that. See near the end of the video where the driver clearly rotates the steering wheel several time
            | and the wheels barely straightened out.


                |That would be power assisted steering...


                    |I'm saying it looks like the car might not have power steering, yes.


                        |I think you have the wrong idea about how power steering works. 


                            |Many times, cars without power steering will have a higher steering rack ratio (more turns of the s
                            |eering wheel to turn the actual wheels) to help make it mechanically easier to turn the steering wh
                            |el.


                                |A car that has a malfunctioning power steering system will difficult to maneuver from a stand s
                                |ill for this reason. It's meant to be assisted and was designed for less turns of the wheel, an
                                | without the assistance there's a lot of resistance.////Some people think that if power steerin
                                | fails, it's no big deal because cars in the past did not have power steering. But the mechanic
                                | are very different for each.


                                |The only experience I have with power steering-less cars was my 69 Ford Torino, and this was NO
                                | the case with that car.  But fair enough. 


                                    |Yep, my 2000 Saturn doesn't have power steering and it's at most 3/4 full rotation of the w
                                    |eel to get the tires fully right or left.


                        |It does. That's what he's saying is the wheels turned so little while he turned the steering wheel so m
                        |ch means.


                |Have you tried turning the wheel in a stationary car with manual steering?


        |I drove cars without power steering. Lack of power steering doesn't stop you from doing S maneuver. 


    |Didn't make it to the end. Does he run out of gas?


        |I grabbed the progress bar and watched the second half in fast forward. (S)He shuffles back and forth and gets out with
        |an 11 point turn. I counted.////TURN. THE FUCKING. WHEEL. FASTER. BEFORE. YOU GO.


            |Or just do a S at the start, backing into a vacant spot.


        |BREAKING NEWS: You can skip forwards by using the play bar. 


        |*she


    |That's hands down the most frustrating thing I will encounter all day. 


    |oh my god, just cut the fucking wheel.


    |Slap the person that gave this idiot their license.////If you are this bad at maneuvering your vehicle you shouldn't be dri

    |That other lady waiting her turn has some patience!


        |I think she wanted to enjoy the show.


    |That person should not be allowed to drive.

            |Thank you!!


    |I have to think that car has a better turning radius than we were shown there.


    |Perfect execution of a 68 point turn, and no dented fenders to boot.

    |Ah yes, the old 27-point turn.////Classic maneuver.


    |OOOHHHHHH!!!! The agony of wanting to be able to pull the idiot out of the car and do it for them in 10 seconds. I had to s
    |op watching. 


        |[this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTKFaBvW6oc)?


    |Back up turning the steering wheel to left a bit so you avoid the car directly behind, turn hard right a few feet before re
    |ching as far back as you can go.////Turn steering wheel full left and drive out of lot.


        |Thanks, captain obvious.  I'm sure none of us knew what to do in that situation until you brought your brilliant expert
        |se.  


            |Only takes one to not know for it to be useful. ////Also if it was obvious the original driver would have known.


            |You'd be surprised


    |This person has to have a fucking brain tumor or something.


        |possibly. otoh, to have a brain tumor, one first needs a brain


    |Comments from users on Youtube were not harsh enough - Had to come here...

    |Watching this stressed me out.


    |Best music video ever


    |What a complete fucking moron. 


    |Oh my god I was raging halfway through. I swear that driver could not have made it more difficult for themselves. Jesus.


    |I just got pissed off watching this.


    |This is art.


    |Alright how many had to skip to the end to see if he made it? Cuz I know I did


    |Never go full retard.


    |The driver has the worst case of spatial stupidity I've ever seen.


    |somebody wasted over 4 minutes trying to get out of this lot. then someone else wasted at least 4 minutes watching it, then
    |wasted more time uploading it to youtube, and now over 10000 people have wasted 4 minutes watching it on the internet.////t
    |e total economic opportunity cost wasted by this video is catastrophic.////The most interesting part of this video is that

        |It's entertainment value pays for itself.


    |My blood pressure is sky high right now.

    |how on earth did he get his license?

    |This person is going to kill someone, and I just hope its themselves.


    |The idea of cutting the wheel all the way AND THEN hitting the gas was much too complicated for this driver.


    |/r/cringe


        |Agreed, that was really difficult to watch.


            |I would of gotten out of my car, done it myself, and bid him adieu. Ain't nobody got time for that.


    |I would SO get out of my car and smack the shit out of that driver with a tire iron.


        |"I would absolutely spend years in jail because that person made a mistake that had no impact on my life whatsoever. I'
        | just that much of a badass."


    |I'm pretty sure whoever was doing this had something wrong with his head. Either that or marijuana.


    |this made me madder than elephants dying 


    |A woman, big surprise there. 


        |Watch out! srs is out there, watching you.


            |You say that like it should be acceptable to say things like that.////"A black person, big surprise there."////"A M

                |If you took all the people who drive like this and put them in a room, what do you think the demographics of th
                |se people would be? That's why no one is surprised it's a woman. 


                    |A generality does not make it okay for you to make hateful, derogatory, or condescending remarks about thos
                    | in the group.


                        |I said I wasn't going to argue whether its appropriate or not but here goes...    //  //First of all I 
                        |gree, there is no right time to make "hateful, derogatory, or condescending remarks". That said "I'm no
                        | surprised it was a woman" is not one of those remarks. There are countless, legitimate studies that sh
                        |w women, on average, have less spacial awareness, slower reaction times, and operate worse under high p
                        |essure situations, ie: are worse drivers. These facts should never be used as hate or to bring down wom
                        |n. But there's no reason not to say "I'm not surprised this was a woman". Just like if a man got into a
                        |high speed crash, I would not be upset if someone said "I'm not surprised it's a man". Men are more lik
                        |ly to drive at reckless speeds.  //  //I find it important to be open about our differences, whether th
                        |y be cultural, historical, or gender related. If not they become triggers for taboo, hate, degradation,
                        |and condescension when they don't have to be.


            |Studies have shown that women have worse spacial reasoning, which would come in handy in situations like this. Guys
            |evolved to have it because they went out and hunted, so they needed the spacial awareness as to not get eaten by a 
            |ion or something. I think this is what leads to the women being worse drivers generalization. 


            |fuck srs


    |I assume English is a second language for you? 


    |I'm pretty bad at parking but this is just ridiculous 


    |That person should not have a drivinglicence.


    |How do you get a license without understanding how a car works.


    |I wonder at what point the driver looked around and just said" how the fuck did I get here?"


    |There is a subreddit about bad drivers, right? There has to be. There are (sadly) many more videos like this one. 


    |On the bright side, at least they're really good at getting close to other cars but not bumping them :)


    |Too bad natural selection no longer exists.
