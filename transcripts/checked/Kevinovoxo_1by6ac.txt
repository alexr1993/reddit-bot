    |**Here is context**////I've actually seen this episode of Cops. It is season 24, episode 21. [Proof](http://imgur.com/qXC4EEF) and more
    |[proof](http://imgur.com/Ld8eNZH).////The dude is actually pretty compliant. He was having an argument with his wife and these cops com
    | up on him and grab him. If you notice as soon as the cop grabs him he says why are you grabbing me, I've done nothing to you, talk to 
    |e.////After they taze, tackle, and rough him up they finally get him to talk. The cop asks him why he didn't follow his instructions. T
    |e guy says that the cop disrespected him. He is man and should be spoken to, not just ordered around like an animal. I'm a man, you're 
    | man. Talk to me. Don't grab me. I have my dignity.////When they put him in the car he refuses to talk any further because they've disr
    |spected him as a person.////The cop actually looked like a dick. I'll try and dig up the episode.////If you have easynews you can watch
    |the episode now.////TL;DR: The cop was a dick and grabbed him before talking to him like a person.////EDIT: fuck ton of spelling, becau

        |True. He wasn't committing a crime. It shouldn't be a crime to react the way he did.

        |You didn't have to prove that you've seen Cops; I would've taken your word for it.

        |Also using a taser when a guy is standing still like that is fucking ridiculous.

        |Australian Here.////I watch Cops and find it SO brutal, I mean called for a domestic and next thing they've got guns drawn, then th
        |y're tackling someone who's going "I GOT NUTHIN!! I GOT NUTHIN!!!" and smooshing their face down while shouting "RELAX YOUR HANDS!!
        |RELAX YOUR HAND!!" and I think "Geez guy, you try relaxing when you have 5 officers on you, previously pointing guns at you, knees 
        |n your back and your face being pushed onto the road.////But then I think "They got guns there. Maybe that's why it's cuff first, q
        |estions later" - the cuffing of ALL witnesses before sorting out the problem is what really gets me. Then I watch the Australian co
        |s (Highway Patrol etc) and they're all joking with the people, cuffing only when they need to, and then uncuffing even when detaini
        |g - because the person's being a good guy.. I dunno, if I were in charge of the policing in the States I don't know that I'd like C
        |ps being the advert for the country. You know?

        |Came here looking for something like this. Tasers are supposed to be used in place of a gun, as in a nonlethal alternative to when 
        |ou were going to shoot someone. I can't drum up a situation where I would think my life was in mortal danger because someone wouldn

        |This. I am glad to see this post. My fellow Americans need to really have a sit-down, calm conversation about the police force and

        |A few simple questions you can ask can put an asshole cop in his place:////"Are you detaining me?"////If yes:////"On what charges?"
        |And then, "I maintain my right to remain silent", because you're probably in some shit. Get a lawyer and make sure you ask for a tr
        |al by jury.  Even if you're innocent, still, [**stay silent**.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc)// //If no:////"Then am 
        | free to go?"////They cannot ask you to do ANYTHING if they say they are not detaining you, [as far as I know](http://www.youtube.c
        |m/watch?v=F9a_cBxnE5Q).   It is your right to remain silent in this case as well (of course) and not answer any of their goddamn qu
        |stions. ~~[This even works at alcohol check points.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILqc0DMh84k)~~// //**EDIT** Apparently, this do

        |constitutional under the 4th amendment of reasonable search and seizure, although [ten states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_
        |heckpoint#Legality_in_the_United_States) (Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and
        |Wyoming) outlawed them at the state level and two more (Alaska and Montana) don't use them.//

        |I can see why people hate the police so much. The police can freely assault you without proper provocation or reasoning.

        |This is why I fear the police when I visit the US. I'm brought up in a country were (in most cases) you can talk to the police and 
        |eason with them. This whole "I-don't-care-who-you-are-or-what-you've-done-or-not-done-you're-going-down-because-I-can" attitude sca
        |es the shit out of me. The feeling of helplessness in these situations really frighten me.

        |ID: c9bh0tw, Author: Bluedemonfox
        |Yeah I was wonder what was going on, the video was short so I couldn't tell much but it definitely looked like the police just came
        |out of nowhere and never even tried reasoning with the man. ////That guy didn't even look like he was being aggressive at all and a
        |tually looked more confused at what was happening to him.

        |ID: c9bh15f, Author: nerys71
        |so the guy lawful told the cop to "f off" for his sit down order so to speak. IE it was an unlawful order and he had every right to
        |refuse to comply. Good for him. I hope he "won" later in court.

        |This man needs a medal. Both this poster and that black gentleman. The cops need to be kicked in the nuts.

        |Yet cops expect you to bend to their whim and don't have to show any respect to the communities they serve. We need to improve comm
        |nity/police relations.

        |ID: c9bibt7, Author: WellBye
        |The cop also used the taser as a compliance tool, which, as a less-lethal weapon, is not its purpose.

        |There was an interesting post on Reddit forever ago about how, after you've been read your Miranda rights, you ought to just shut t

        |And for the record, it is almost certain that one of the taser barbs failed to make contact.  You can't just shrug off electrical c

        |I would like to know if he had reportedly hit his wife, or if the officers witnessed him hitting his wife.

    |ID: c9b9k0q, Author: xRyNo
    |One of the taser barbs didn't make contact, probably got stuck in his shirt or something.

        |I was going to say...I've been (voluntarily) tazed, and I've seen some of the hardest dudes you'd ever want to meet get tazed^* and
        |short of a PCP fueled rage mode, I'd have a hard time believing he just took that like it was nothing. ////(^* I was at a land comb
        |t expo in Germany in ~2003 and they had a booth where you could volunteer to have the barbs attached, not shot into you, and then t
        |zed. Yeah, that shit hurts)

        |I was going to say, I don't think it's humanly possible to withstand a taser shock.

        |ID: c9bgiup, Author: DELETED
        |You can see one of the barbs doesn't fire properly and even hear it hitting the wire of the other one on its way down. It doesn't g
        |t anywhere near him.

        |ID: c9bfjd2, Author: Tischlampe
        |yeah, after I read this, I looked closer and yeah. you are right. seems like one barb couldn't penetrate his skin (what reason ever
        | and fell down.

        |ID: c9bgchs, Author: Oznog99
        |It's his loose, torn shirt.  The projectile is a thin barb followed by a wider slug.  The slug part can't possibly go through cloth
        |ng.  If the clothing is loose enough that either can't reach skin before the slug stops on the clothing, the Taser won't work.////T
        |sers do fail to tase, it's not all that uncommon.

        |ID: c9bgr1n, Author: adaytoocala
        |A number of cases could apply here. ////1. Both prongs did not make contact (probably the case as you can hear loud audible clickin
        | slighty different than the sound made when the prongs have made contact and the circuit is complete.)////2. The subject could have
        |been on PCP or any other drug that affects the nerve receptors. ////or 3. The officer was not standing far enough away to create a 
        | inch spread in the prongs (prongs at least 4 inches apart from one another.) //////

        |ID: c9bgu8w, Author: bacon_up
        |It's funny how people think a taser is just as good as a gun for self defense.  

        |ID: c9bdzwn, Author: bobide
        |Which is weird because tasers work at a high enough voltage that it should be able to arc from your clothes to your body.

    |ID: c9bcf3o, Author: wutitdopikachu
    |He wanted the officer to tase him. It feeds him power. The power to get bitches.

    |So, police are given a less-lethal weapon, and it becomes their first choice after giving an order? ////Didn't jump when I said jump? E

    |**Here's the conclusion**.////http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=NHb2_P1Xd7g////What a terrible use of a taser 
    |TW. I think *tasers* should be used when physical harm or lethal force would otherwise be necessary. Not when a man is just standing an
    | not "sitting".////EDIT: I'm not saying they *can't* use tasers in non-lethal situations, I'm implying that they shouldn't tase someone
    |who's not an active threat and already about to sit down. People can fall and knock out teeth, especially old people. I guess a lot of 
    |eople here think they should tase anyone not "complying". Imagine being tased for talking when told to shut up.

        |Some US jurisdictions allow the use of a taser to 'gain compliance’ (obedience) from people who are *not actively resisting arrest*
        |////Tasers are like any other tool: in the right hands, they can be an effective, nonlethal weapon. Used poorly, they become a catt
        |e prod or a torture device.

        |ID: c9bcw6m, Author: Leucetios
        |I feel like what's going on before what we see is pretty important. I highly doubt this is a case of him "just not sitting".

        |Policeman: I'll give you one chance, do a hand stand.... ////You: What? ////Policeman: Alright that's a tasin'.

        |ID: c9be9g2, Author: wicketr
        |Wait what? I hope you mistyped that. When it's time to use lethal force, they will use their gun. They aren't going to reach for th
        | taser when their or someone else's life is on the line. ////The taser has virtually replaced the batton, which is essentially just
        |used for trying to control the person. It's used when they need non lethal force. Using a taser is better than a batton because the
        |taser doesn't typically leave someone severely bruised or with broken bones or a concussion.

        |This is still a clipped version. There was a bunch BEFORE this. I fucking hate that, people removing context from a video, and now 
        |he cop is 100% wrong. I don't recall exactly what the guy did, but he was being threatening or combative or some such before either
        |of these clips start.

        |ID: c9behae, Author: girafa
        |&gt; Non-lethal force is supposed to be used when lethal force would otherwise be necessary////Tasers are labeled "non lethal tech"
        |but there's absolutely no law saying that Cops are only supposed to use them in situations where they'd normally use their gun.

        |ID: c9bhafg, Author: servohahn
        |&gt;I think tasers should be used when physical harm or lethal force would otherwise be necessary. Not when a man is just standing 
        |nd not "sitting".////Yeah, their purpose was to cut down on police shootings. Like the police were literally killing so many people
        |that they had to go looking for a non-lethal way for the police to abuse people. It almost instantly became a do-what-I-command-thi
        |-very-instant-or-I'll-torture-you-into-submission tool. ////Tasing someone immediately who's not belligerent and dangerous is not c

        |The use of a firearm should exist when there is an immediate threat to the general public or the police officers. In other words, i

        |ou feel threatened but there is no imminent threat on your life, unlike in this video where the man is simply not obeying orders. G
        |ve him a few more minutes and if he's still non-compliant and being aggressive, by all means, taze him, or better yet, pepper spray
        |him because he's really not in a position to cause harm to the officers at this point.//But why? Why should a harmless taser be a l

        |&gt; Not when a man is just standing and not "sitting".////You're **grossly** minimizing that. It's not simply a man refusing to si
        | down, it's a man committing a crime: resisting or obstruction, based on your jurisdiction.////In the midst of a stop of any kind, 
        |ou do what the officer says. Period. If you feel persecuted or wronged in any way, *the time to resolve it is in a courtroom, not o
        | the side of the street.* The officer doesn't know if you're carrying a gun, they don't know if you're a mass murderer fresh from k
        |lling your 34th victim, they don't know a thing about you. Comply and sort it out later.////Looking at the rest of the video, the g
        |y was obviously extremely combative. Dude needs to just listen.//

        |Tasers should be used in situation where the user could say "instead of shooting him, I tasered him." Not before imo.

        |Thank /u/imisstoronto for his comment//Here is context//I've actually seen this episode of Cops. It is season 24, episode 21. Proof
        |and more proof.//The dude is actually pretty compliant. He was having an argument with his wife and these cops come up on him and g
        |ab him. If you notice as soon as the cop grabs him he says why are you grabbing me, I've done nothing to you, talk to me.//After th
        |y taze, tackle, and rough him up they finally get him to talk. The cop asks him why he didn't follow his instructions. The guy says
        |that the cop disrespected him. He is man and should be spoken to, not just ordered around like an animal. I'm a man, you're a man. 
        |alk to me. Don't grab me. I have my dignity.//When they put him in the car he refuses to talk any further because they've disrespec
        |ed him as a person.//The cop actually looked like a dick. I'll try and dig up the episode.//If you have easynews you can watch the 
        |pisode now.//TL;DR: The cop was a dick and grabbed him before talking to him like a person.//EDIT: fuck ton of spelling, because.
