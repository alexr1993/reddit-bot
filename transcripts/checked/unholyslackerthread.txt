Detroit man killed after hollering at driver to slow down(/r//r/news)




    |I'm not saying violence is the answer but if it bothered the killer so bad why not just fight it out there? Why go home, sw
    |tch cars, and come back to shoot him? What a coward.


        |I think that you answered your own question, the guy is an ignorant coward.


            |The killer would probably kill you for saying that, which makes him even more of a coward.


                |Nothing makes me rage more than the fucking useless murder of innocent people!


                    |And cowards! I hate cowards!


                        |like the guy that killed the pants on the ground guy


                            |wait he's dead??

                                |no, there was apparently false rumors of his death spreading around the internet.


                                    |&gt;"The rumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated," General Larry Platt told the A
                                    |C Monday night, debunking wide-spread Internet rumors of his demise.


                                        |Obviously Grand Theft Auto Vee saved this man's life. 


                                |I was looking for proof, but apparently I was fooled once again by the internet. I found an art
                                |cle that says he's alive. anyways the world isn't such a dark place anymore!


                        |Personally, I dislike phonys.


                            |I don't like airplane food. Am I right?


            |As most criminals are. Problem is, society seems to refuse to call them out for being a coward. Majority of the gun
            |related deaths in this country are done by cowards. Wish people would see that. 


            |That guy would have gotten his ass beat probably, that's why he took the bitch way out.


            |A coward is someone who is afraid.  It would be more appropriate to call him a poopy-head.


                |No, anyone that resorts to a machine that kills from a distance is a coward.


        |Because it was two different people.  The two events were coincidental, tied only by a father who didn't want to acknow
        |edge the fact that his son might have been killed by someone who wanted him dead. 


            |I don't know, it could easily just have been because he yelled at the reckless driver.////It's like in 2011 when th
            |t dad in the McDonalds broke up the fistfight at the counter, and one of the guys followed him out, then beat him a
            |d shot him three times which resulted in his death.////Some people really hate being "disrespected."////


                |Are you fucking kidding me? He possibly prevents people from being hurt (not to mention fucking up the line and
                |shit) and gets killed for it.////Fuck people.


                    |There's no proof of what he was yelling at the other driver at all other than the word of a grieving father
                    | reported on by a "news" site that uses the word hollered. He could just as easily have been yelling threat
                    |. I'm not saying that's definitely what happened, just that there is not enough information.


                        |He's referring to the McDonald's incident.


                            |Ah gotcha. The part about the line makes way more sense in that context. I still stand by my statem
                            |nt, though. Whether it is relevant to the conversation or not.


                        |I don't often use the word myself, but are you suggesting "hollered" isn't a proper word or something?/
                        |//Regardless, yeah, who knows what really happened here.////Although, even if the young man did yell ou
                        | threats but the other parts were true, there would be no reason to come back to the scene with a weapo
                        | unless the driver was a murdering piece of shit.


                            |I'm just suggesting that it isn't a word that should be used in a news report. While I understand w
                            |at the writer was saying, using the word "holler" causes me to question his credibility.


                                |I'd agree more if it had been spelled incorrectly. I imagine the reason this particular author 
                                |sed that word is both a regional and cultural one, but I could be wrong.

                                |ates back to the 1690s and this is absolutely a correct use of the term.


                                    |It's still a poor choice of word to use for a publication. It comes across as a colloquiali
                                    |m really.


                                    |I never said it wasn't a word. Living in the south I hear it used almost as often as y'all,
                                    |which has an entry in the online etymology dictionary as well: http://etymonline.com/index.

                                    |at if you do, it makes me question your credibility.


                    |Honestly, life is to short to get into other people's business. People are always going to get hurt and peo
                    |le are always going to die,  just let nature run it's course. ////Some people don't like to live like that,
                    |but you can't be up in arms when bad shit happens to those people. 


                        |By this logic we shouldn't pay to have a standing police force or prosecute people at all. If we don't 
                        |et into other people's business, they can do anything they want, including hurting others.


                |I got in a fight last Wednesday. For yelling "slow down pleasing" at a lady  for almost hitting my landlord, my
                |neighbour, my cat(Pancake), and myself in front of my house.  She slam her brakes, got out, called me names, an
                | we got at it verbally.  She push me, started getting into SUV, and then slam the door on to my back.  I had en
                |ugh.  Boyfriend was on the porch at this point.  I grab her arm.  Swung her around. Picked her up in the air an
                | slammed her into the ground.   End of the fight. ////She got into SUV, moved it away.  Came back and hit my bo
                |friend in the arm!  Landlord had enough at that point, and the cops showed up.  It was crazy and fun for me.  I
                |sure do live up to my name. 


            |&gt;Was a young man really gunned down just for shouting at a passing vehicle? Yes.////The level of journalism Clic
            | On Detroit did on this story is deplorable. They crafted a narrative based on hearsay and then reported it as fact
            | If I submitted that story to my editor, I'd get shouted at in front of the bullpen and a cigar burn on my arm.


                |Easy Peter Parker, not everyone is up the The Bugle's standards. 


                    |No, but the Free Press is.////At least it's not WJBK.


                |Agreed, this is amazingly bad writing.  How this guy holds down any writing job, never mind winning 'awards' (c
                |eck his bio) is confusing, to say the least.  The whole article reads like it was written by someone who won a 
                |ompetition to become a journalist that was only open to people who live in sheltered accomodation for the funct
                |onally illiterate.


            |I believe what you are saying but the article suggests it was the same person. I'll admit that once glance leads me
            |to believe the guy was probably a criminal to some extent. Could you share how you knew it was two different people


            |Good thing you have all the evidence and knowledge at your disposal. You've solved the case. Well done.

                |if you were going to commit a murder, you wouldn't do it while driving your main car. the second car was probab

                    |But how do they know it was the same guy who was speeding through their neighborhood? Did the kids ID him a

                |e car and argued with the guy. He probably was seen and/or heard by others. So he switched the cars, possibly g
                |t his gun and then came back and likely shot him from the car (unless any evidence points to something else), b

    |My condolences to the family. Sad story.

    |Had some guy in a truck that almost ran me over at a pedestrian walkway, so I yelled to slow down. Guy slams the breaks and

        |Humans get really mad when you do something that points out their stupidity to them.


    |Shit, I have yelled at many a speeding drivers to slow down.  


        |You should seriously consider stopping for many reasons. The guy driving that fast isn't gonna slow down because you ye
        |led, if anything, it'll piss him off more and he'll likely drive more recklessly. If you see someone driving like that 
        |ust grab their plates if you care that much and report them. There's also a good chance the guy will confront you for i

            |What a sad world we live in where we can't confront others on their behavior for fear of retaliation.


                |It has always been true that you can't confront d-bags for acting like d-bags in public without taking on some 
                |ersonal risk. This isn't a new feature of the world.


                |Of course you can. And it is not like this has happened all of a sudden. The only difference is that in ye olde

            |Pray tell, which Northeastern suburb are you soapboxing from?


    |This sounds worse than a third world country. 


        |Detroit IS a 3ed world country. More then half the city is condemned, about 10% of the traffic lights work and those th
        |t do...well they are considered by most to be yield signals. The city has lost almost all of its tax base in white flig
        |t after the racist piece of shit kwame kilpatrick took office. (his office now is prison for the laws he broke while in
        |office) so now they are getting welfare from the feds so they can give the criminals that live there more handouts


            |White flight happened long before Kwame Kilpatrick. 


                |You're right, but the reason isn't any less due to black-on-white racism. The [race riots](http://en.wikipedia.
                |rg/wiki/1967_Detroit_riot) of 67 pretty much ended any possibility for peaceful cohabitation of Detroit. After

                        |For example, KidCheetos mentions that Detroit's main source of income was the auto industry and the ill

                        |Detroit moved out due to lack of job availability? If that is the case, many white families would be in
                        |a similar situation as now if they had chosen to stay in Detroit as job availability dwindled.


                            |Here is an [overview](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Detroit) of the decline of Detroit.//
                            |/The major decline of the auto industry in America didn't occur until the 70's, when competition fr
                            |m abroad put a massive dent in American auto manufacturer sales. As the wiki entry states, a more d
                            |veloped roadway system certainly allowed some jobs to relocate to the suburbs.////However, without 
                            |he race riots of 67, I don't think that Detroit would have ended up as it has today. Would it still
                            |be in decline? Most likely, however a city cannot run without revenue. Without middle-class whites 
                            |iving in the city of Detroit and paying taxes, supporting local business, etc... there's less reven
                            |e. And once the exodus of *people* occurred, business relocation only escalated.////So no, there is
                            |'t one single reason why Detroit ended up being a pocket of third world in a first world country - 
                            |ou're right about that. However, I would give white flight the designation as the number one reason
                            |for Detroit's decline with the auto industry's issues in the 70's as number two. White flight affec

                    |eapon from being traced back to them. Even in an America where it was harder to aquire these weapons, crimi
                    |als would still be able to get them, and use them. You act like someone willing to massacre a bunch of kids
                    |wouldn't go through with it because the local massacre store is shut down.


                        |If only you knew. It's funny when I see people make shit up. 


    |Being from Detroit, we try and convince ourselves it's not that bad, but it's that bad.  ////Go Wings though!


    |What the fuck is wrong with people?


    |The best way to survive Detroit is to stay *out* of it.


    |Detroit is a violent place and it is infested with gangs.  Yelling at the wrong person can get you killed.  It's a terrible
    | terrible situation.  This young man didn't deserve to die.  His killer does.


        |Coincidentally, gang violence is pretty low in Detroit (other cities have way more gang violence).  If anything, if thi
        | was a gang related incident you'd see the Detroit gang squad there within minutes ... it's one of the few things that 
        |eally riles up the DPD anymore.

                |Ah, that is sad.  Hopefully with the bankruptcy and renewed efforts to get grants, Detroit can start to reinsta

                    |lity.  The squad made up 7% of the city officers but had 30% of the complaints of police brutality.


                        |Thanks for the info.////However, the gang squad was pretty successful and it sucks that they were allow
                        |d to act that way.


                            |As a former Detroiter who has dealt with the "goon"  squad on numerous occasions I can honestly say
                            |I have only ever seen the intimating side of them. Living in Detroit as a white male can be rough a

            |True enough, its more freelance crime. For some reason, the gangs never really gained a foothold in Detroit. As opp

            |It isn't that they should stop being born there, where your wording implies the responsibility rests with babies -

                |tions, and believe in the system because of that.////In areas where there is no hope and no advancement, you do
                |'t see this.  Look at immigrant groups in France, where they are denied access to citizens, education and good 
                |obs.  You'll see a lot of crime there.  It's similar to areas that have been economically depressed for a long 
                |ime, and for which there is no hope.////That's not to say it's the only ingredient.  But it's an important one.

                |I've been through Detroit enough to know that I was given far more opportunity and advantage than most of the k

        |Sit at your computer. Don't ever go into the city to work or meet people. Develop these opinions. Then keep them there.
        |Because that's the only place they're true - in your head, behind your keyboard. ////If you've ever met anyone that liv
        |s or works in Detroit, you would know how incorrect you are. These people care about their kids, their happiness, their

    |So many people in this thread who have probably never been to Detroit spewing just utter bullshit. Yes, the city is in bad

        |No it's a shithole


        |for real. I don't live there but I've visited many times for sports events, concerts, museum, etc. I've never felt unsa
        |e there, but of course I didn't go walking around in the ghetto by myself. Most of Detroit (outside the downtown area) 
        |s just abandoned buildings which unfortunately attracts criminals and junkies. ////There are so many problems with Detr

            |Exactly the downtown area is pretty safe and the food is excellent (especially in greek town)


        |Do you think it makes them feel better about themselves? I honestly can't think of a reason to just shit on a city othe

            |People just like to talk out of their ass without thinking twice about it. I love Detroit, I don't live there but i
            |s a neat city. Some of the best foods, best sports, and some very cool festivals. Have I ever felt unsafe in Detroi

                |Thank you. Your reply made me feel better about it.

        |I went there once when I was 11. My parents didn't allow us to get out of the car to pee when we stopped at a mcdonalds
        |because there were people yelling at each other. It happened at every place we stopped at before we got to the consulat
        | and even there, my parents carried all three of us into the building.


            |Sounds pretty ignorant to me, how long ago was this when you were 11?//


                |About 12 years ago.


                |Probably 1 year ago.


        |Just like this gallery when people talk about Detroit:////http://imgur.com/a/8xiqn

        |Really because it seems to me like a guy just got shot for saying words.

                    |When the US auto industry insisted on building cars that no one wanted.


    |When I was looking for a new job a year ago I had a ton of interest from Detroit, but I refused every single interview, and
    |this is why.  It's basically a 3rd world country there.  I can't believe the government wants to pump hundreds of millions 
    |nto that place.  Just let it die and maybe something of value will rise from the ashes some day.////The amount of senseless
    |violence that occurs there is worse than Chicago.  It blows my mind that someone could take the life of another person just
    |because they yelled at him to slow down when there's kids around.  I can't even begin to comprehend how twisted and broken 
    | man would need to be to justify the murder of another person who poses absolutely no threat to his safety.


        |Really sounds like IRL Gotham City 


        |Its easier to justify when the police have an average 50 minute response time.////Not that I blame the police, of cours

        |They can't just let it die, no matter how many criminals and other degenerates live in the city, there still outnumbere
        | by the hundreds of thousands of poor people who live there too. A lot of these people have nothing and can't afford to
