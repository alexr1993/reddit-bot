            |how did this get upvotes?


    |"I brought you a flower but I eated it."


        |Why is wonky grammar so cute?


            |It's due to all the brainwashing cats have done over the years

                |All that did was make me laugh.


                |Well.. the dog *is* black.


            |Perhaps you remember it from Pon and Zhi


        |Ate.

    |My lab is a garbage disposal. She will eat ANYthing.


        |No kidding. My old family lab once ate:////- Half of a whole turkey, he jumped up and nabbed it off the counter during 
        | Christmas party, ran into an unpopulated area of the house, and ate half the thing in less than 2 minutes.////- An ent
        |re stick of butter, same thing, different party. &gt;&lt;////- An old-style 3-4 inch tall painted glass Christmas bulb,
        |the big ones. Picked it out of the garbage - shat it out whole, lucky bastard. We never could figure out why he ate it.
        |///- My favorite, though, was taking him through Dairy Queen drive-thru, getting him a baby cone, and watching him devo
        |r it in one bite, to the amusement of some minimum wage worker.


            |What's with labs and eating glass? Mine ate a basement window once.////Dozens of chocolate-infused cakes, cookies, 
            |upcakes, etc, and at least two candy cane houses.//'////Talk about an iron stomach, //////Miss my lab.


                |I'm going to need a story about your dog eating a basement window haha that sounds so ridiculous 


            |Ha! We had a giant lab mix who LOVED hamburgers. Whenever we went through a drive-thru we would order her a cheapie
            |cheeseburger. Then we would unwrap it and toss the whole thing at her in the back seat. She always caught it on the
            |fly and ate it in one bite :)//


            |My dog once ate half a burger, but the tricky little blighter left the other half on the plate (it was a plate pile
            | with the burgers we were gonna have).  No one saw him do it and my dad blamed me, but we figured out it was our fl
            |ffy friend.


            |Mine managed to open a door and are about 10 pounds of semi-frozen tri tip. She was walking around a bit slower aft
            |r that. 


            |My dog:////* Two pounds of butter//* Two pounds of bacon//* A loaf of bread//* Butter again//* Dining room furnitur
            |(Splinters missing from it)////Never had a problem with glass, though.////I miss her, she died of a heart attack 3 


        |I feed my dog bits and samples of everything I eat, I avoid the typical bad things, fat, onions, chicken bones, chocola
        |e, sweets, grapes/raisins... But olives, she refuses to eat them, if they are buried in a pile of food, she will pick e
        |ery one of them out and leave them on an empty plate.   I use to have an olive tree long ago, my guess is she ate raw o
        |es.


        |Mine had an obsession with the insides of shoes for a long time. Never the outside, she would just rip the inside liner
        |out and eat it. 


            |feet odour probably something to do with it.


            |Mine likes socks. Both of my dogs will steal them from the basket and snuggle them.


            |I think the way they see it is that they've already breached the outer "hide" of the beast and are trying to rip th
            | thin inner-flesh out of the shoe. Mine do this with toys.


    |I hope those are dandelions she's eating and not ragwort? (Ragwort is very poisonous to horses and humans so probably also 
    |o dogs. Yellow daisy like flowers)  


        |I was thinking the same thing, and it does look more like ragwort than dandelions. o_o


    |Aww, what a doll, she needs to be seen at /r/labrador.


    |Cooking with Coco: "When you prefer your flowers *al dente*, let the stem soak in your saliva for a few seconds."


    |Oh my, that face!


        |Those eyes especially! I could never be mad for my dog eating anything with eyes like that!


    |I remember when my lab used to eat things and it was cute and things, that was nine years ago.  Last night I had to clean u
    | a puddle of diarrhea from some mess he ate outside.


    |I just awwed out loud


    |There are some posts on r/aww that I actually can't help but squeal out loud. This is one of those posts.


    |Adorable


    |D'awwwwwww


    |bae caught me eating flowers


    |That is so adorable


    |My lab also has a flower addiction


    |What's her name? :-)


    |Awwww puffy cheeks.

        |was hoping to find this here.  I love when he's on the surveillance cam and his reaction is spot on "shame"


        |http://i.imgur.com/UukuV.jpg


    |I am a victim of society!


    |Those look like Dandelions. 


    |I catch my pup playing in the garden all the time.  She walk inside like it was nothing else.... "Why do you smell like lem
    |n thyme and mint....?"


    |http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClfsOvKXuK8////the first thing to come to my head.


    |A bird probably died in those flowers. //Dogs love to mess around in that stuff.//Cute pup. 


    |You should name her Daisy. 


    |Nice try, puppy. I guess that's one way to get karma for your selfies. Can't wait till they "catch" you "sleeping."


    |The last dandelion!


    |You might wanna not let her do that. Though I know my dog tends to eat grass to flush out her system with fiber so it indic
    |tes when I need to have her checked out by a vet.


    |You should feed your dog.


    |You're lucky that's all she's eating. My dog eats everything, flowers, mud, flower pots. Hell, she even eats her own poop.


    |That is the most remorseless face I have ever seen.


    |My secret shame!


    |My Dalmatian used to eat grass all the time. And if she ever caught you looking at her she would just give this look of sel
    | loathing.


    |My dog liked [eating flowers](http://i.imgur.com/Y5PiH.jpg) when she was a puppy too.


    |My dog likes eating flowers....just kidding my dogs dead


    |That face is so adorable!!!


    |The awesome part comes in a few hours when she poops out flowers. ////Though this morning, my dog pooped out flowers, it go
    | stuck on her butt, so I pulled the turd all the way out and she flipped out like I killed her.////When it was out, there w
    |s one little flower on the turd.////Now she's afraid to poop :(


    |That dog is so sweet-looking. What a beauty!!


    |I am melting this is so cute! No homo


    |Nu Husky does this every chance she gets. It's gotten so bad that we can't have any flowers inside or outside.


    |You're lucky she's not eating sea oats.


    |My dog is a destroyer of nature.  Sometimes while she's running through a field she'll snap up dandelions.  She's also deci
    |ed that she loves cucumber plants so I can't leave her unsupervised in a garden.


    |Just about everything labs/goldens do make me laugh.


    |"Babe caught me eating"


    |Bae caught me sleepin'


    |It's funny now, but my sister's golden developed a beazor in his gut from eating too much plant material.
