|The thing I find ironic about Muslim extremists is that they become violent when an image of Mohammed is portrayed since they fear that any
|depiction of him would lead to worship of a man and not Allah. However, by having such a profoundly extreme and violent reaction, I really 
|o feel that they are in essence deifying him. Just my two cents.

    |Call me crazy, but I think the subtlety of your point will be missed by the Muslim extremists you refer to.

        |Fundamentalists of any color seem to get blind with rage faster than their reason can kick in when you try to point out subtle logi

        |Smith was a guy who lost gold tablets with the Word of God on them, or to atheists that for most people scientific "truths" are act

    |I've never quite understood why the image of Mohammed is not allowed to be portrayed by ANYONE, not just Muslims. Why are even non-Musl
    |ms not allowed to see his image? What harm is it that the image is produced so long as devout Muslims try their best not to see it? ///
    |I honestly don't know the reasons, someone please enlighten me!

        |ID: c67vem0, Author: hvusslax
        |Well, some muslims say exactly that. That this whole Mohammed portrayal business only applies to muslims. Before the whole Danish c
        |rtoon scandal, most muslims didn't even know they were supposed to be this offended by such images.

        |ID: c67v6wb, Author: wackylol
        |The reason is that some people like to control others because they have serious fucking issues and while the rest of the world arou
        |d them progresses they do everything in their power to slow down advancement of society because they have nothing to cling to but t
        |e mistaken notion that they alone are correct

        |ID: c67vt0b, Author: v3lociraptor
        |I'm not sure about Islam, but in some religions, you're not supposed to portray prophets because it so easily leads to idol worship

        |You're not thinking like a zealot.  ////Those non-muslims are infidels who are, I am assuming, going to hell or deserve to be kille
        | if they don't accept Allah, the one true God.  

        |ID: c67w86f, Author: thederpmeister
        |The only reason Muhammad is not to be portrayed is so people don't end up worshipping the image. As a Muslim though, I don't really
        |see the big deal if others do whatever. For example, I always become happy when I think about the statue of Mohammed at the US Supr
        |me Court as it is an honor

        |ID: c67vmfe, Author: Gibodean
        |Same reason that Christians in America are fighting for the right to deny their employees birth control, and denying other people t
        |e right to marry.////Some people like being in a cult where they are the chosen ones, and let other people get on with their own sh
        |t.  However others need reinforcement that they're right, and by making everyone live by their rules and follow their god, they can
        |keep thinking they're not crazy.

        |ID: c67wjgd, Author: Drudeboy
        |I think it has to do with context, figurative art has always been a controversial issue in Islam.  ////To start off, the ban on dep
        |ctions of Mohammad has not been accepted by all Muslim cultures.  Persian art, for example, has a rich history of depictions of the
        |Prophet.  I'm not entirely well-versed on the theological justifications, but the ban is not universal (however, I think it is obse
        |ved by the vast majority of Muslims today).  ////I think the rage here has to do more with the cultural and political context of th
        | depiction.  It comes at a time when Muslims around the world are suffering from a serious victimization complex, bitter towards th
        | West due to its slights towards the Muslim world (both real and perceived).  In places where rumors spread like wildfire and there
        |exists a very deep distrust and even loathing of the West, these depictions seem to be another attack on their culture.  ////I don'
        | want to overemphasize the context thing though.  I was talking to a Turkish professor of mine about this very issue, and when I br
        |ught up the context of a post-9/11, Second Persian Gulf War world, she mentioned similar instances in the 90s in which some Muslims
        |overreacted to depictions of the Prophet.  ////Oh, another thing: the violence isn't just the reaction to the depictions because th
        |y're depictions, it's the disgusting portrayal of the Muslim world's most revered man.

        |ID: c67wq10, Author: Goldface
        |This was the same reason for the split between the Greek Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church way back when. The issue is 
        |hat they'll worship either a) the man or b) the actual idol. Not worshiping what the idol means exactly, but rather the idol itself
        | It would be like worshiping the cross because it's a cross, not because Jesus died on one.

        |ID: c67vzbg, Author: omgimsuchadork
        |For a similar reason, though a bit off topic, I don't understand why my Jewish friends (and some Christian ones) write out "G-d" in
        |tead of "God." It's not taking His name in vain, like saying "God dammit" or anything, it's just a reference to Him; how is it any 
        |ifferent than using another name or pronoun since everyone knows what you mean?

        |ID: c67wjlo, Author: DELETED
        |Its an element of control in the religion. Depictions that humanize an obscure, ambiguous, infinitely saint-like being would lead t
        | a disarmament of the psychotic choke hold this religion has on hundreds of millions of uneducated, impoverished people. They're re
        |ction is bitterness that someone else is not reduced to instant subordination and worship of a figure that they were indoctrinated 
        |nto eternally submitting to. Basically, resentment. 

        |ID: c67wpow, Author: DELETED
        |I believe that's actuall one of the big points of interest in today's world. My History professor explained it quite eloquently to 
        |e several years ago. He summarized, that essentially one of the root causes of the open hostility from groups like Al-Qaeda is they
        |feel that other cultures offend their religion, despite most muslims noting that the second half of Quran is usually ignored, as it
        |was written during a time of war and Mohammed was referring to the enemy when he used the word "infidels". Now, some of the above c
        |uld be me forgetting/warping what he said with memory, but essentially they consider anyone not Muslim as an insult to their religi
        |n.

        |ID: c67wvsq, Author: Drunken_Black_Belt
        |They don't forbid images of Mohammed expressly. They forbid any images of idolatry. Muslim extremist include their prophets under t
        |is. Which is funny because they also view Jesus and Moses as prophets so they should be outraged at this picture. Instead they tend
        |to focus on just Mohammed for this rule, for a variety of reasons.

        |ID: c6835oh, Author: deidru
        |It's control; since it's their religion they feel they should control out.  They use the idea of worshiping the image is worshiping
        |a false idol.  In other words, you'd be concentrating on the image and it's depiction rather than the true prayer.  Hate to tell th
        |m though,  they've already found pictures (allegedly) of Mohammed in the Hagia Sofia.  Due to continued requisition of the	HS, they

    |ID: c67vdun, Author: six_six_twelve
    |Jews follow this as well, and don't have any images of God in a temple. It's in the ten commandments:  //    //"Thou shalt not make unt
    | thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water 
    |nder the earth.  //  //Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the i

    |ID: c67vvk2, Author: omiclops
    |As a non-extremist (majority btw!) Muslim, I completely agree with you. The funny thing is, the majority of those who react so angrily 
    |re actually (most of the time) just bad Muslims who see it as a way to make themselves feel better about their own religion, because th
    |y don't do enough of the important stuff (like praying etc) so they resort to stuff like complaining on social media. It's an absolute 
    |oke and they give the majority of us a bad name.

    |ID: c67vxrr, Author: Falkner09
    |agreed, especially since virtually no muslim gets offended by depictions of other people, which are supposed to be equally as discourag
    |d; you cant deify ANYONE or ANYTHING in Islam. ////however, there are still some small sects that oppose depictions of even regular peo
    |le, to the point that they will not allow their picture to be taken, and have at times harassed people who possess photos of family.

        |I am going to hijack this and copy/paste what I just posted on FB, so that it isn't buried:////Hello fellow Redditors on Facebook w
        |o are posting The Onion's recent picture headlined "No One Murdered Because Of This Image".////If you read the (admittedly hilariou
        |) accompanying article, the very first sentence states "no one was murdered, beaten, or had their lives threatened". What you, fell
        |w Redditors, seem to have forgotten is that religious radicals come in all shapes and sizes. By propagating this article to Faceboo
        |, you are invariably showing it to people who will not understand the humor. Those people, in turn, will send it to their fundament
        |list friends, who will send it to theirs', and so on.////Death threats could most certainly ensue. Most certainly once it gets to t
        |e hardcore Christian fundies.////I personally understand the humor behind this picture/article, however it wasn't properly executed
        | By spreading it to an audience that might not quite grasp the idea, you're inviting a lot of controversy.////What I'm saying is, s
        |metimes spouting off your controversial opinions isn't really in the best interest of everyone involved. Let's try not being so sel

    |Sorry for the pedantry, but this type of comedy is generally referred to as 'satire', not sarcasm.////My dictionary says:////&gt;satire
    ||ˈsaˌtīr|//noun//&gt;//&gt;the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, part
    |cularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.////Like much satire it is also sarcastic, but I think its pri
    |ary purpose is satirical.

    |I agree with the Onion piece entirely. No other religion carries *regularly* kills for religious offences these days, for imaginary cri
    |es like apostasy or blasphemy.////However, we should remember that Hinduism has also carried out extreme religious violence and repress
    |on in the recent past, although not on anywhere *near* the scale or intensity as that carried out in the name of Islam these days. The 
    |assacres of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002; the destruction of the Babri Masjid Mosque in 1992 (because its proximity to the supposed birth
    |lace of Rama was deemed an affront to Hindus) and the ensuing riots; the massacres of Sikhs in 1984, all across Northern India, in resp
    |nse to the assassination of Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. In all of these events, the Hindu absolutism reared its ugly head.///
    |Then there was MF Husain, India's great modern painter, driven from his homeland to die in London, for daring to paint gods who are onl
    | to be painted by those with Hindu surnames.////India is now heading into a state of religious nationalism, into its Mount Rushmore bui
    |ding stage. Its not as strong any of the Islamic nationalisms, like Iran, but it is still a very dangerous development, not to be ignor

    |&gt;Edit: considering the replies pointing out it's not all Muslims going apeshit on Muhammad portrayal but a minority, I want to make 
    |t clear I fully agree. It was not my intention to generalize. By saying 'Muslims' I meant it as contrasting to people of other faiths, 
    |ot as "all Muslims are like this".////But that is the major point of this cartoon. There are no fringe minorities of any other religion
    |attempting to kill the artist. If someone doesn't understand this point - then they really don't understand the Onion article.
