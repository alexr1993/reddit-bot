    |Do you remember all events leading up to the explosion?//Were the things you imagined during your coma related to the accid

        |I remember everything prior. The thing I imagined were a mixture of reality, horror movies, personal fears, and hospita

            |y years, but doing that job was the worst. I'd guess we picked up around 1-2 people in your condition a day during 
            |ighting season. It's hard to express what it was like, after picking up people with missing body parts who are bare
            |y alive, and having the medic scream at us (the pilots) to go faster because this one... this one might make it. Of
            |course, we can only go so fast and our blackhawks took alot of damage from being pushed to their limits. Glad you m

                        |I think part of the affliction is that it makes getting help so hard; the confusion is almost total, ma
                        |ing choices is insanely hard.  You have a wall in front of your face where before there was a clear pat
                        | and choices were easy.


                            |The awareness being pushed now will surely help. More for friends and families to see the signs and
                            |be there to help. I can't imagine how difficult it is. 


                                |Thanks for caring.  As much as I sometimes hate being "thanked" for my service, I sincerely app
                                |eciate that people care.

                |We have 2 cats. They are awesome. Leeroy (not pictured) doesn't give a fuck about anything he's awesome


                    |Leeroy don't give a fuck. He does what he wants! I like this cat already.


                        |He's the best. He loves to get his belly rubbed

            |You should ask about emdr therapy


            |This is only an observation based on something I have read, but there's an article somewhere that mentions soldiers
            |that have seen action overseas and suffered from PTSD were getting treated by actually playing war-based video game
            | such as Call of Duty. I'm a little fuzzy on the details but I think the reasoning behind it was that they were abl
            | to relive their experiences of being in war in a safe environment and able to help them deal with those specific t
            |iggers. ////I actually found two articles while I was in the middle of typing this which I linked below. // //http:

            |Every so often I'll read about some study or another that shows that playing Tetris is supposed to help with PTSD, 
            |hough they're not completely sure why. (But apparently some other games can actually make it worse, I think one exa
            |ple from one study was something called "Pub Quiz"? They seemed to think the main difference was that Tetris is vis
            |al/spacial while the other is textual/conceptual?)////Any thoughts on that?


            |Like modestmonk said, EMDR is effective (can't be used in certain circumstances, like if you're mentally too fragil
            |, as one example) and MBCT (aka mindfulness-based stress reduction MBSR) is also empirically proven.


            |Research is *extremely* preliminary and this is **NOT** currently an available treatment method. I'm hoping to give
            |you the potential for hope here, but it is not currently a solution.////Professor David Nutt has been considering, 
            |nd more recently studying, MDMA as a treatment for PTSD. It looks very promising as MDMA appear to disconnect the e
            |otional and rational parts of the brain, allowing people to work through issues without having the extreme emotiona
            | reactions that come with PTSD. Should these studies and trials be successful, MDMA would be used as a therapy aid 
            |nder the guidance of your therapist. I DO NOT recommend that you just go and pick up some street ecstasy to see how
            |things go. I DO recommend that you follow Professor Nutt, MAPS, and have some hope for your future &lt;3


            |You probably won't see this but I have a tip for panic attacks/PTSD. I suffer from PTSD and I've been through a lot
            |of therapy. One of the things that helps lessen/stop panic attacks is holding ice in my hand. It's enough stimulus 
            |o shock your system a bit, but you aren't hurting yourself. Have a loved one remind you or bring you some when you'
            |e having an attack or you feel one coming on.


                |Im gonna read everything posted on here. Thanks for the tip


            |i have a tremendous respect for an old CO of mine, for numerous reasons, but the bit that resounds the most is imme
            |iately upon return from deployment, he addressed his company saying that he would be going in for counseling/therap
            | sessions starting that day and offered to help anybody else get into some. his intention was to set the example th
            |t even a tough, badass dude like him could confidently and unabashedly sign up for counseling. he effectively mitig

            |I think I have a mild, undiagnosed  case of PTSD from a car accident (a school bus drove into my car). I've had a h
            |rd time finding someone who accepts my insurance. I've never served in the military and don't have what most people
            |think of when they hear PTSD. But buses freak me out. The accident was upstate NY and now I'm in NYC, relying on pu
            |lic transportation.  When I see then coming up the street or blasting through intersections, I cringe and move way 
            |he hell back. Never assume those guys are watching where they're going! ////I'm wondering if you've been able to ov
            |rcome any of your anxiety, and if you have any advice for someone like me who needs to learn to do the same.////Tha
            |k you for your time. I'm sorry this happened to you. 


                |Not OP but - ////EMDR might be able to help you. It targets the specific incident that caused anxiety, and brea
                |s down the power it has over you. The memory can be 'neutralized'.////But, your first challenge is finding some
                |ne to accept your insurance... and then hoping that that someone also offers EMDR. Best of luck to you, whateve

    |How long we're you in your first coma and do you remember anything during that time? Were you dreaming, conscience and trap

        |For me it was a continuous event, I closed my eyes on the chopper and woke up in September. But apparently I was commun
        |cating before that. My jaw was wired shut


            |May be a stupid question, but how was it a continuous event if you had nightmares about the hospital staff and such

                    |Farther up you said that you had nightmares about your doctors when comatose, so I think he's asking how it

                    |in a helicopter, and the next you're in a hospital". 


                        |You know how when you wake up from your dreams and you have no idea how long you were out and you remem
                        |er tiny bits and pieces and remember less the longer you are awake... and then sometimes you see someth
                        |ng or someone that reminds you vividly of your dream. Dreams can feel like years and only be minutes. D
                        |esn't mean you will remember it all when you wake up. So for him, it was like falling asleep and waking
                        |up... it was continuous... also because it was an induced coma it probably functions a bit differently 
                        |han a non induced coma, hence the communicating before that... which he may have been conscious for but
                        |just doesn't remember since the brain likes to block out severe trauma.

    |ons:////Was the VBIED driver detonated or remote det? ////Did you or anyone in your element see any VBIED indicators prior 
    |o the explosion, or was it completely unexpected? ////Did you sustain the majority of your injuries from shrapnel or the ac

    |y secondary IED's or an ambush after the initial detonation?////How were you evacuated after the blast?////Thanks again!///


        |EOD tech here: I feel like this is a good opportunity to chime in with a reminder to keep OPSEC in mind when discussing
        |this stuff. A lot of the answers to these specific questions have the potential to be classified.


    |What advice would you give to someone wanting to join the military? I'm personally not, but I feel like a lot of young peop
    |e join up and don't really realize what that entails (like possibly dying, or having half your face blown off).


        |Don't do it if you aren't mature. If you aren't sure whether you are mature enough to do it, you aren't. I have seen ki
        |s get mentally destroyed, among other things. It's not Call of Duty


            |I consider myself to have been 'mature enough' when I went into the military.  I was not a grunt but I did spend a 
            |ignificant amount of time outside the wire during two of my four tours.  I have survived a VBIED as well.  I was fa
            |ther away when mine cooked off, I suspect.  Didn't get hit but I did get thrown on my ass.  My experience pales in 
            |omparison with yours, and even I needed some therapy when I got out.  Glad you are doing this.  Writing a personal 
            |arrative that I let a few trusted people read really helped me.  Best of luck on your recovery, man!


                |Hope you're doing better brother. Keep looking forward

            |t mean to vent. Everyone's been telling me it'll make a man out of him so it's good to hear that some people just a

                    |My point exactly. :/

                |May I point out that there might be something else driving him to he in the military that could be addressed. I
                | seems clear that he doesnt want to join because he relates to the average soldier and wants to be around more

                    |Well, it does work that way for some guys.  But if this kid is "considering" it and people are telling his

            |I respectfully disagree with this. I was the epitome of immaturity when I joined. My years in + deployment really k

        |OP gave a great answer.////You are right, many people join up with no real understanding, my advice would be to do rese

                    |Thank you. I think it's important that people deciding whether to join the military know everything about t

                        |Knowing "You might die", or "You might get your face blown off" is not the same as accepting it as real

                            |Yes, I guess I agree that it won't happen to you just because you sign up. You're just hanging out

                    |hat it's a thing that can happen but it probably won't.////I also don't get up every day and consider that 
                    |'ll be killed in combat or kill someone else in combat. This also probably won't happen to me. Know why? It
                    |s because I'm not in combat. Why shouldn't it be a pivotal decision point? A better question: what *should*
                    |be the pivotal decision point?


    |How can a civilian like me, that doesn't (can't) understand what you are experiencing and have experienced help you and oth
    |rs like you through this?////If its not too much, what specifically are you facing in terms of PTSD and fears or feelings a
    |out the future?


        |Not OP, but here's my experience. I don't claim to have PTSD, and I had a strong support network of close friends and a
        |good church. My therapy consisted of getting plastered and spilling everything awful that happened to my best friend an
        | bawling it all out.////I will tell you what I hated, and I can speculate is probably magnified for people really suffe
        |ing from PTSD. After church it was like a soldier show and tell. Tons of individually well meaning people wanted to let
        |me know that A) they were thankful I was alive B) they supported me the whole time (most did via care packages, this wa
        |'t insincere) and C) I was a hero.////All of this individually is fine and well intentioned. My church was really good 
        |eople and they did demonstrably support me during my deployments. However, when I was stateside the aggregate effect on
        |me personally was I didn't want to go to church or be around people because of how draining it was to interact with so 
        |any people I knew mostly tangentally. It felt like being mobbed, I sure as fuck didn't think of myself as a hero and it
        |was painful to be told I was. I slowly distanced myself from public interaction. It felt like I owed them stories and i
        |teraction as thanks for their support. They all also knew me better than I knew them because my parents were very good 
        |bout keeping the church as a whole updated with how I was doing.//////Thank God my family was amazing and I had a great
        |circle of close friends to keep me stable, because I pulled out of group social interaction entirely.//////IF YOU ARE A
        | ACQUAINTANCE: The upshot is, respect the suffering soldier's desire for privacy and normalcy. Don't call them a hero, 
        |ecause it's a thing to say. If he got a medal for heroism, okay, you can tell him he's a hero. If he just served and po
        |sibly got injured he may not feel like a hero and it hurts to be told that. Hell, he may have fled like a coward when s
        |it went down. He may have let a buddy die. Combat is madness and these things happen more than civilians realize. You c
        |uld be rubbing serious salt in an emotional wound. If you're a distant friend or acquaintance, you can tell them you're
        |there for them if they ever need to talk. Maybe a phone call or email. Don't mob them at a party, church, social gather
        |ng etc. PLEASE don't ask them for stories unless they offered on their own! ////If you're a close friend or a family me
        |ber BE THERE for them. Get involved in their life and watch to see how they're adjusting to reintegration with civilian
        |life. This is when it's okay to intrude on their private time, when you are a CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND or FAMILY. Kill the
        | with kindness, if they're hostile and unresponsive. This is a little bit like dealing with a depressed or suicidal per
        |on, you can't just let them chill and trust they'll work it out on their own.//////That's all I can think of off the to
        | of my head. I'm happy to talk more if you have other questions.//////PS: if it seems I'm coming down hard on well mean
        |ng people who were trying to help and didn't realize they were hurting, I don't mean it that way. I have no blame or ir
        | for them, they couldn't possibly know and no one could have told them but me, I just wasn't equipped to do so. Now, I'
        | telling the people I can.


            |That's really solid advice for acquaintances, family and close friends.  I had similar feelings upon returning.  I 
            |sed to get drunk and talk about the war...  I tended to get one of two responses...  "That again?!" or being used a
            | a prop by the pro-war people of what I good guy I was because of the things I did.  That shit got old.  So I stopp
            |d talking.  That's not a good answer either.  Therapy works.  I highly support it for all returning vets whether th
            |y think they need it or not.


                |I was pretty fortunate that none of my post war interactions were in any way political. The people around me we
                |e simply pro-soldier and kept their feelings for or against the war private. I can think of only one exception 
                |here this jackass was super anti-war (which is fine) but he was hounding and harassing me to go AWOL to support
                |his anti-war stance. Fortunately he was a friend of a friend and I only saw him once. I don't know how I would 
                |ave handled your situation. Probably badly.


                    |I don't think that dude understands the life wrecking ramifications of going AWOL.


                        |Fortunately, I did.


            |Spot on. Also, the question that makes me want to choke a motherfucker out is SO FREQUENTLY ASKED IT BOGGLES MY MIN
            |: "Hey man, so uhhhh, how many people did you kill?" It's usually young college males hyped up on CoD or BF3, and f
            |els like they're just trying to get a story out of me to tell their frat buddies.


            |Just out of curiosity, what do you mean by "kill them with kindness"? I'm not in this situation right now but I'm v
            |ry curious as to what I should do if I am.


                |It's the idea that you are kind towards someone who may be reluctant or even hostile to your kindness. The hope
                |is your kindness will eventually win out over their negative responses, thus you have "killed" the mean them an
                | helped a healthier them emerge. It's similar to turning the other cheek, loving your enemies, tough love, and 
                |o on.////Edit: it's not easy either. If you haven't tried to be a good reliable friend and be kind to someone w
                |o actively hates you at the time, it's extremely painful for both parties.


        |Iraq vet diagnosed with chronic PTSD here. I actually have just recently been through the Army's Warrior Combat Stress 
        |eset Program (which I would recommend to EVERY vet just returning), so I've pretty recently just started to recover fro
        | my PTSD side effects (excessive drinking, explosive anger, chronic depression, etc). I deployed 10-11, which basically
        |means it took me 2 years to admit I had a problem. What makes me (and my buddies) feel better are the people (family, c
        |vilians, friends, it doesn't matter) who at least attempt to understand or accept that we have been through some shit, 
        |nd just try to deal with us. We know we're fucked up in the head, that's where alot of the anger comes from. I can't te
        |l you how much better it makes me feel when I start to have a panic attack or an anger outburst and someone just says, 
        |Hey, it's okay man. It'll be alright", and genuinely means it. It seriously warms my heart and soul, especially hearing
        |that from a stranger (I've freaked out in public before and a stranger helped me cope). Sadly, it's mainly only other v
        |ts who've been there and done that that can lend support.


        |Would love to hear about OP's experience with PTSD to help civilian's understand what sufferers deal with. I'm sure the
        |e are many who have been in combat who struggled with this, and it would help people know a bit better what it's like a

                    |The ignorant dickhead probably downvoted you.


    |First off, THANK YOU for your service.  My question is this: what is the state of the VA?  What needs improving?


        |Shortage of qualified service providers (Doctors, dentists, psychologists, psychiatrists...) makes it so that you have 
        |o wait weeks, months before you can be seen. The docs push antidepressant meds for everyone and everything, it's scary 
        |tuff. It's like they make a fat commission or something. Also, they pay like shit, so you get the bottom of the barrel 
        |ocs. Regulations that is designed to fail soldiers with mental issues. I could go on


            |I work at the VA, and I can confirm a lot of that. The meds they push have been shown to be effective and are well 
            |tudied, but that doesn't mean that they work for everyone, or that everyone wants to take them. All the people I ha
            |e worked with are good providers, but the system is weighed down with bureaucracy and things just take so long to g
            |t done.


                |&gt; I work at the VA, and I can confirm a lot of that.////Do you think the government healthcare will help the
                |level of care provided by the VA or make it worse?////


                    |I'm commenting only as someone who uses the VA, so feel free to correct me, but the VA is essentially socia
                    |ized healthcare. It is federally funded. The doctors are federal employees.  ////The level of your co-pay i
                    | dependent on a disability rating you were given when you were discharged from the military. If you're rate
                    | high enough it's free and if you're not rated high it is still quite cheap -- almost like a formality more
                    |than a necessity. ////So I don't think the ACA will really have any affect on the VA system. 


                        |Former Navy Corpsman and current RN, I would expect the ACA to make the civilian medical system more li
                        |e the VA. Especially as we have started the wave of Baby Boomer retirements that were due to stress the
                        |system anyhow. According to [AARP 8,000 Boomers](http://www.aarp.org/personal-growth/transitions/boomer
                        |_65/) retire per day currently.


                        |, the ugly side of the ACA that many are not willing to acknowledge as a possibility. 


                        |Given that both systems are government fubded and run socialized health care do you think obamacare wil
                        | be run as poorly as VA?


                    |I don't work at the VA, but I use the VA. My guess would be if premiums are affordable then fewer vets will
                    |use the VA, especially if they have a condition requires frequent visits. That being said, if someone is a 
                    |isabled vet then they will probably still have to use the VA regardless of how cheap premiums get, that is,
                    |if they get cheaper at all. It's not really government healthcare, it's just a requirement to buy insurance
                    |with an expansion of Medicaid/Medicare. If you make X number of dollars a year after your service, your pre
                    |iums might even go up, which could increase dependence upon the VA for retired vets who still have a job bu
                    | have experienced higher insurance costs for what might be a family of 4. Not saying I'm for or against it,
                    |but it's completely different than a single payer system used by other countries. I just typed this whole p
                    |st and realize it only applies to the USA, sorry.


                    |The government healthcare will damage the level of care throughout the country, not just the VA.

            |I can vouch for the dental side of the VA in Arlington, TX.  I am a hygienist in a private practice and we just did
            |about $45,000 worth of work on a guy from the VA.  He had been going there for years and the dentists there would n

            |Yeah, what's up with the drug stuff?  Thorazine shuffle all over the place.  Not just that though, the SATU's are l

            |What is the attitude within the actual military (soldiers and command) on soldiers with PTSD, are they actually rec

    |ld have made a difference but decided not to. But it is comforting knowing that the army is doing everything they can to ma
    |e his, and most of everyone in that position's lives better. It is very comforting knowing that you are doing this to both 
    |elp yourself and help others to know what it is like. Keep it up. Thank you again. 


    |Hey there! Thank you so much for doing this. I have a close family friend who suffered a TBI through a gunshot wound to the
    |head. You guys are an inspiration to me, and I never imagined the capability to which you could still live a normal life or
    |even function after such a tragic incident. I've got one thing I want to share with you, and a couple questions(on behalf o
    | my friend).////One thing I want to share is Superbetter.com. I hope you have taken a look at this already in your recovery
    |process, but if not, I strongly urge you to check it out and watch [this video!!!]( http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal
    |the_game_that_can_give_you_10_extra_years_of_life.html) . Jane mcgonigal is a TBI survivor who basically made this game whi
    |h helped her get through the anxiety and depression that she suffered through her injury, and break through from PTSD to Po
    |t-Traumatic Growth! ////Also, if you have some time, check out the Lifehacks series of tedtalks. There are a couple other T
    |I survivors who've used this experience to grow and ultimately become a stronger, better, more in the moment person.//////S
    |oo questions! How is your mobility from the brain injury? My friend relates very well to stroke victims as his left side ha
    | gone from completely immobile to slightly useable in just 2 years. I imagine that because of the rest of your injuries the
    |e are more aspects to the recovery process, but I know he would be interested to hear how you fair.//////Has this experienc
    | made you more aware of the important things in life? For instance, do you feel that you should now persue the things in li
    |e that truly matter to you, rather than things that you feel you 'have' to do?//////Thank you again for this! I truly hope 
    |ou can discover the joys of Post Traumatic Growth as my friend has, and turn this experience into a rebirth of your own sel
    |. :)////Edit: the link I posted was broken so I fixed it. Please watch! Also Amy Cuddy, another Tbi survivor does an excell
    |nt talk on her story aswell.


    |The PTSD, does it ever lessen. Have you found a way to dull your reactions, and not freak in front(or privately) of everyon
    |. If so, what is the method?


        |I don't hang out with "everyone"


    |I was in Bagram (RC East Near Kabul) and I heard about this. Honestly bro, I thought you died. I'm really glad to hear that
    |you didn't and I wish you the best of luck.


        |Army strong! I'm fucking resilient if anything else. I had a lot of people scared...


    |Sorry if you already answered this question. I didn't see this asked so I figured I would.////What do you remember of your 
    |omatose state of mind? What was the craziest dream-thing?////Did you ever just want to be euthanized?////I'm not sure if yo
    | know the song" One" by Metallica. Your situation reminds me of the story behind the song.


        |I dreamt that my wife was selling me off to a shady group of people who kill wounded vets and then cash in the death be
        |efits.


    |I used work for the VA before having to leave due to health issues (I am not a veteran or active military, so I was unable 
    |o get accommodations EDIT TO ADD: my particular VA only had accommodations for vets/military unless you had been there a ce
    |tain length of time, which I hadn't.  I did not want it to seem I begrudge anyone else their accommodations, because I don'
    |; just wish I could have stayed there longer).  I definitely heard a lot of the concerns you express about having to wait f
    |r appointments, the pushing of certain meds, etc., and I can't blame you.  There have been great improvements, but there is
    |still a long ways to go, and some areas are better than others.////While I'm not a vet, I worked with several (as coworkers
    | the majority of clients were vets too, of course), and there were a few different takes on this: How do you feel when peop
    |e, especially strangers or people you barely know, say "thank you for your service?"  Some I knew didn't mind,I some felt i
    | unnecessary but well-intentioned, others felt uncomfortable about it, and a few even disliked it outright for various reas
    |ns.  Just wondering your take on it.////Also, what do you think would be helpful for those of us who are lifelong civilians
    |to know in terms of how to better support vets/military and their families while they are deployed, overseas, etc.  I never
    |knew anyone who served very well until I was an adult (excepting my now-deceased WWII vet grandfather, who got out as soon 
    |s he could and did not even care to identify himself as a vet), but after meeting so many, especially after having worked a
    | the VA, I wondered what more I could do for the men and women away from their homes and families.////Thank you.


    |When driving or walking around do you ever get spooked by stuff on the side of the road or the way some cars are driving(go
    |ng slow, or scrappy cars parked)


        |I have a good one for this.////I'm an EOD tech and have been deployed seven times. My second deployment was to Baghdad 
        |n 2007, and my team defused just about 120 IED's in our six months there. Granted, most were very easy/straightforward 
        |nd we weren't in much danger. However, you treated EVERY box and garbage bag by the side of the road as a threat.////Wh
        |n I got home, I drove from NC up to NJ to visit my family. About half way into the trip, I'm driving North on 95. As I 
        |as cruising along in the right lane, I saw a cardboard box by the side of the road. I freaked, and slammed on my brakes
        |coming to a screeching halt right next to it. Luckily, no other cars were around. I immediately came to my senses, pull
        |d over, and realized how fucking dumb I was being. ////This was before they started doing a mandatory two-week "cool-do
        |n" period at home station after a deployment so you can decompress, talk about shit with mental health professionals, a
        |d make sure stuff like that doesn't happen. 


    |How do you feel about Republicans not letting laws that will care for veterans go through the House?////Was there ever a po
    |nt in combat where you thought to yourself what am I doing out here?////Do you have an opinion about kids playing violent s
    |ooter games as fun since you have actually been in a firefight?////What is being in a real fight like? What did you think, 
    |eel, see, hear etc.////Thank you for your service to me and the rest of the country.


        |Fuck Republicans.//No.//I think games are games. Let your god damn kids play. Pay attention to them instead of limiting
        |their play time.//I don't think it's hit me how dangerous it was just yet. I still have teenage invincibility syndrome.


            |Are you worried about your benefits stopping because of the shutdown?  You mentioned your education money has stopp
            |d because of it, but apparently the VA disability benefits will stop soon also. Will you be okay?


            |Brother (army from long ago), thanks for your service. Please do not fall into this "blame Repubs for everything" c
            |ap. The Dems are playing dirty too. 


            |Sounds like you aren't as mature as you think someone should be in order to join the military. Teenage invincibilit
            | syndrome is likely to get you or your mates killed out there


        |&gt;How do you feel about Republicans not letting laws that will care for veterans go through the House?////Wow, what a
        |vague and obviously loaded question. 


            |But... Republicans... *aren't* letting laws that care for veterans go through the House. How is that a loaded quest
            |on unless you think this statement in untrue?


                |It is loaded because he/she did not provide any relevant sources or mention exactly what they were talking abou
                | AND generalizes all in one sentence... how is it not loaded? Please. 


                    |I know what a loaded question is. But the premise of this question--that Republicans aren't letting laws th
                    |t will care for veterans pass the House--is a true premise. Just because someone discusses the actions of a
                    |group doesn't mean it's automatically a fallacy of generalization. It's not a matter of opinion--you can ch
                    |ck the Congressional Record.


                        |&gt;Letting laws that will care for veterans////This sentence doesn't even make sense within the scope 
                        |f the congressional record////In 2012, Republicans blocked a $1bn dollar bill that was aimed towards he
                        |ping Iraq &amp; Afghanistan vets find employment (There is currently a 11% unemployment rate amongst th
                        |se vets). It was not blocked because the Republicans "don't care for the vets".. it was blocked because
                        |there is no friggin way the country can afford that. It violated the budget in 2012 and the democrats l
                        |kely did this as a way to pull off some clever political grandstanding. ////In fact, as of now, Democra
                        |s are blocking bills that would continue the funding of Veteran affairs... so... "Why are Democrats not
                        |letting laws that will care for veterans go through the house"? ////It was a loaded question, but it wa
                        | also a stupid question. There is always more to the story than a simple "Republicans/Democrats suck! Y
                        |u agree, right? Cause they are doing this!" &lt;void of sources/evidence/explanation&gt;. ////


                            |Don't act like Democrats are the problem here. Republicans can't hold the budget hostage until they
                            |get their way regarding the Affordable Care Act, then shut down the government, and *then* want to 
                            |ut back the parts people are fussing about because they're feeling some heat. I don't blame the Dem
                            |crats for letting them feel it. It's a consequence for their own actions. ////It's like a 2-year-ol
                            | having a tantrum because he can't have a cookie before dinner, and saying, "Well I won't eat anyth
                            |ng then!" When he starts to get hungry he says, "Okay. I'll only eat cookies." Now the parent is a 
                            |ig meannie because he won't give the kid a cookie. ////So yes. The government isn't shut down becau
                            |e the Republicans don't care. It's shut down because they care more about stopping the ACA (which i
                            | already a law).

    |I have a friend that survived a similar attack in Iraq, he lost sight in one of his eyes and is dealing with PTSD. He's ref
    |sing treatment for the PTSD because he doesn't want to give up his Second Amendment rights. How helpful is the treatment fo
    | PTSD?


        |Is there a source for his belief?  I know each state is different, but does being treated for PTSD then exclude a perso
        | from firearm ownership?


            |There's a box on the purchase form that says something along the lines of 'have you ever received prescribed psychi
            |tric help' which can disqualify you.


                |That's horrible.  We send people to war to ostensibly fight for their country, then strip them of rights that p
                |ople who never served a day can enjoy?  Fuck everything about this!!!


            |It's the reason he gave me, and as far as I know having a mental illness could exclude a person from passing a back
            |round check but I haven't looked into it.


    |Thanks for doing this AMA. While there is a lot more awareness about military and combat specific PTSD, etc it is still a l
    |rgely misunderstood and mysterious affliction to the majority of the civilian population. It also is a sort of boogeyman fo
    | those of us who are in uniform like if we do not talk about it it won't happen.////My brother survived a number of IED inc
    |dents when he was in Iraq. He is now back home, off active duty, and in school. He is not the same and we are trying to fig
    |re it out and it is really hard. Our dad is a Vietnam vet and another brother has also been to the sand box but the one bro
    |her just will not speak to anyone. Can you offer any advice that might help us?////Additionally, I am in the chaplain corps
    |in the Navy and have been a VA chaplain as well; a lot of what we do is dealing with the knock on effects of PTSD. Even wit
    | all of the training we receive what you, and so many others, are dealing with remains a mystery. Can you lend a little ins
    |ght into your life, your emotional state or progression through the course of your day/week/etc?////Obviously your wounds a
    |e pretty significant and you have struggled and overcome quite a bit. Some things are big and others are small. What are wa
    |s that friends, families, etc can support someone such as yourself? How do you feel that the community around you has faile
    | to provide support and how can we do it better?////Lastly, I want to again extend to you my gratitude for doing this AMA. 
    | sincerely hope that your *person* makes a full recovery even if your body is not able to. I want to reassure you that ther
    | are people who love and care about you very much. I lost a cousin to suicide after he lost his legs in an IED attack, not 
    |o mention the Sailors, Marines and others who I have lost (including my own chaplain) to suicide. I care about this a lot. 
    | whole lot.


    |First off, Thank You.  Second, I'm very interested in PTSD and plan on pursuing Psychiatry, with intention to specialize in
    |research for the illness.  ////I understand if you don't want to answer my questions, but since this is an AMA....My questi
    |n is how has this affected your daily life?  What are the symptoms, how frequently do you notice them, to what degree to th
    |y impinge upon your daily life, and to what severity? Also, how does the military treat survivors with PTSD?  Is there any 
    |ort of support system or do they provide psychiatric counseling?  I am aware that historically, PTSD was overlooked and tho
    |e afflicted were not given the attention or care that was needed and I am curious if this issue has been addressed in the m
    |litary.  ////Thank you for everything.  Also, have you heard of the trials being conducted to treat PTSD using MDMA?  Its w
    |rth a look into:  //http://www.mdmaptsd.org///


        |I'll comment on my experience. The military (Army) urges you to seek help, says you're not alone, basically the whole n
        |ne yards. In reality, it's just about the complete opposite. Almost everyone in my immediate chain of command knew I ha
        | PTSD, but after 2 years (when I finally realized it) I went and had to literally find the help I needed. There are *so
        |e* programs in the Army that help, and they help alot. The problem is that they're not advertised, like, *at all*. If y
        |u want help, you have to hunt it down and find it yourself.


    |are you hooked on oxy's?


        |No, but I came close. I was aware enough to back the fuck away FAST! ////Acupuncture works man.


    |Hey brother, I have no questions.  Thank you for serving and for persevering through these injuries.  ////I hope you are do
    |ng well and that your staying active.  Please keep on top of the PTSD.  I have a lot of friends who have served and while I
    |don't know you directly to me you service is what makes our country great.////Take care and don't let yourself get trapped 
    |n the past.  


    |How does you anxiety manifest? Are any of it triggered by recognizable thought patterns? Can you describe the moment before
    |your stress reaction occur? Have you developed tics?////Have you tried psychedelics?////Here's an [interesting talk by Dr R
    |bin Carhart-Harris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT5dZDnJ6J4) about how psychedelics works on the brain. He relates them 
    |iologically to other life-altering religious experiences.


        |Mostly, anxiety happened right after I woke up from coma, and lasted until I could discern dreams from reality, so mid 
        |eptember?


        |Guy has PTSD and got blowed up and you are telling him to fucking trip?


            |I asked if he had tried them. «Finding god» has helped many, and scientists are starting to figure out some biologi
            |al key elements in these experiences. I just think it's interesting.


    |Do you remember anything from your coma? Like were you having a very vivid dream that lasted forever, or is it kind of like
    |when you wake up and can remember some vague events from your dream but can't remember the details?////Also thank you for y
    |ur service. Veterans and active duty soldiers will always have a special place in my heart for what they have to go through
    |(I have a few cousins who served and told me stories).


    |My name's Marissa, I'm 17, and I have PTSD. I hate that doctors have no clue what it entails or how to help with it. It mak
    |s me feel like an alien. And if doctors don't know what to do....I hate how not even my boyfriend feels comfortable trying 
    |o help. We've been dating for 9 months and I have to hide myself when I'm with him because I don't want to scare him away. 
    |sometimes all I can do is cry because I'm embarassed to have PTSD. 


        |I don't know if this would be triggering or helpful for you, but it was helpful for me to read autobiographies of peopl
        | with PTSD. It made me feel that I wasn't crazy. I liked "When Rabbit Howls." I know there are arguments that book isn'
        | factually accurate, but it was accurate from the point of view of the author's perception, and that's all that matters
        |to me. You just want to find someone else who sees things the same way sometimes, you know?


            |Definitely. Thanks, I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels so different. We're perfectly normal socially, and ever
            |thing, but emotionally?  Ha.


            |What's When Rabbit Howls about?


                |It's the autobiography of a woman who has [Dissociative Identity Disorder](http://www.aamft.org/imis15/content/
                |onsumer_Updates/Dissociative_Identity_Disorder.aspx), which has recently come to be understood as a form of PTS
                |. She suffered terrible abuse as a child, but managed to pass fairly well as a normal adult.


        |Hi Marissa,////Sorry to hijack your comment to OP, but I also have PTSD (26f). ////There are therapists and psychiatris
        |s out there that specialize in PTSD, it may take some work to find one that works for you. ////And please don't feel em
        |arrassed, there's no reason for it. Something real and traumatic happened to you. 


        |I hope you've looked into EMDR therapy?


        |How did you get your PTSD?


            |Bad childhood...y'know.


                |&lt;3


                |oohhh


    |Thank you for your service.


    |Give me one soapbox rant you wanna share about the way we treat our veterans.////Then give me one heart-felt and detailed e
    |planation why you look forward to waking up tomorrow.////Thank you for volunteering, thank you for sharing, and thank you f
    |r reading.


    |Thank you for your service. 


    |I have no question. Just hope you stay strong and ask for help or accept it when you can. A dear veteran friend of mine suc
    |umbed to her PTSD a year ago today. //Know that people love and care for you. 


    |do you recall anything from when you were in the coma? people's voices? music? dreams? anything?


    |I work in a research lab that specializes in helping soldiers with TBI through use of advanced neuro-imaging techniques.///
    |What kinds of deficits have you noticed due to your TBI?  What areas of your brain were impacted the most, to the best of y
    |ur knowledge?  How have these deficits impacted your life?////I just process the data at my lab, but never get the opportun
    |ty to actually interact with soldiers or other subjects.  So I'd like to tell you thank you for your service.
