How do Antidepressants (SSRIs and SNRIs) treat Anxiety Disorders?(/r/AskScience: Got Questions? Get Answers.)




    |I'm a psychiatrist who works with children and adolescents, and I will provide some evidence, though I will give you the mo
    |t complete answer:////WE DONT KNOW.  ////That they work is not in question (despite what some prominent naysayers will clai
    |), as the metaanalysis of many of the SSRIs shows that they work, and they work both clinically and statstically more than 
    |lacebo.  They perform as well as talk therapies in most head-to-head trials, and in fact, may be even more efficacious when
    |combined with those therapies.////The mechanism of action has always assumed to be serotonin.  We know that serotonin depri
    |ation (even dietary restriction of the amino acids that produce serotonin) INDUCES depression, anxiety, and suicidal thinki
    |g.  So SSRI's, that block the reuptake of serotonin in neurological synapses, were assumed to be the treatment.  More serot
    |nin=less anxiety.  Right?////Wrong.  The effects of SSRI's do not match the timing of the neurological effect of serotonin.
    | The effect persists after the serotonin levels return to normal, and the SSRI's take MUCH longer to work than the simple i
    |crease of available serotonin.////Now we look at second messenger systems.  It gets increasingly complex.  I've seen almost
    |every pathway implicated.  Serotonin is definitely important, but it's more complex than we currently know.  When the secon
    | messenger systems are identified, I firmly believe we will have an explosion of psychopharmaceutical targets to explore.//
    |/While it's frustrating to not have an "answer," I feel a lot of the times "dumbing it down" to "your brain needs more sero
    |onin" is a disservice because we know its not entirely true and we for whatever reason try to make a complex thing simple./

    |world when we're looking at the brain.  functionally, we know SSRI's work for most people (not all, and no, we don't know w
    |y).  However, the why is very up in the air right now.////EDIT: as an aside: if you're interested in the brain, you're goin
    | to have to get used to not knowing completely.  You can be part of the understanding process, but we are not in an era of 
    |rain science where we know things definitively.  That's about the only definitive thing we know about the brain.  For me?  
    |hen I prescribe SSRI's, I evaluate their effectiveness and ensure that they are safe through careful follow-up and screenin
    |.  I leave the "why" to people who are way more sciency than I am, and trust that one day, we'll know why and have even bet
    |er treatments available.////EDIT2: thank you, oh great internet, for reddit gold.////EDIT3: I'm gonna make a round of repli
    |s now... to those sending PMs, I will reply... but to future PM-ers, please do not ask me personal clinical questions or op

    |sition to help you!  I can answer generalized questions, but I need to put a boundary up for YOUR safety.


        |This is an excellent answer.  ////The best description of psychopharmacological therapeutics I've ever heard was this: 
        |///"It's like pouring gasoline on a car and hoping some gets into the gas tank."  ////Joseph J. Pancrazio (Bioengineeri
        |g Chair at Mason University) said this at a AAAS conference on neuroenhancement about a month ago, and I thought it was
        |brilliant.       


            |brilliant quote, really.  i'm not ashamed to admit I often feel this way.


            |I'm a pharmacist. I like to use a slightly different car analogy. I tend to use it to describe pharmacology in gene
            |al, but it works here, too.////Imagine your brain is an engine. It's very intricate, and now it's making a grinding
            |sound. We're gonna have to do something about it or it'll tear itself apart. Think of these drugs as a big honkin' 
            |rench, and we can hit the engine with it until it stops making that grinding sound. We have a lot of experience wit
            | hitting engines with wrenches, and we know that hitting the engine with certain wrenches in certain spots will sto
            | that sound, but maybe we'll dent the engine. Maybe the a.c. won't work as well after we're done, and we're always 
            |orry to see that happen. But our view is that having to open your window to cool yourself is a small price to pay f
            |r keeping your engine running. You might disagree, and that's fine--it is your engine, after all. I'm just a mechan
            |c trying to keep it running as long as possible.


                |I was reading that stimulants like ritalin and dexedrine are actually the safest psychiatric meds out there. Is
                |this accurate? I've always assumed that they were quite dangerous, but this implies that ssris have a greater c
                |pacity for harm. 


            |It's more like after a few decades of pouring various things onto a car, someone figured out that certain liquids h
            |d a better chance of working. Then someone figured out that if you put certain kinds of liquids in this one port, a
            |lot of times you suddenly have a fully functioning car. But no one knows exactly why or how that is working.


                |The salient point being, that if something else is wrong with the car that can't be fixed by throwing certain l
                |quids at a port, we still have to resort to pushing.

                |&gt; The salient point being, that if something else is wrong with the car that can't be fixed by throwing cert
                |in liquids at a port, we still have to resort to pushing.////That kind of takes the point away from the quote. 
                |he port in the metaphor is the knowledge of how things work. If we had that knowledge we could develop more exa
                |t means of treatment that are more frequently effective, but we don't, so we're continuing to pour gasoline all
                |over the car.


            |Importantly though, the gas-&gt;car example seems to imply an understanding of *what* we are pouring over the car./
            |//What is gas? One way of understanding something is understanding what it does to something else. ////Hormones wer
            |n't conceived of by a human in a relatively "simple" process like inventing a car to move people and things in. The
            |same intuition often doesn't apply. ////I know whenever i'm learning about endocrinology, someone often ends up say
            |ng: It seems like a ridiculously difficult way to do this but this is how we do it. For example, in blood pressure 
            |ontrol, we might have tons of different hormones all trying to reach the same end of raising BP, and it may seem ri
            |iculous and ineffective but there are good reasons for why this mesh of cycles is the one we have. ////The car exam
            |le works if we remember that we have no good idea what exactly gas tanks, gasoline or cars really are :)

        |Just to add on to just how bad our knowledge is on how to treat mood disorders (because it's really scary).////- "Today
        |s treatments remain sub-optimal, with **only âˆ¼50% of all patients demonstrating complete remission**, although many mor
        | (up to 80%) show partial responses."//(paywalled: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627302006530)/
        |//- **Our manner of treating these mood disorders have been the same for the past 5-6 decades.**  Basically trying to i
        |crease serotonin, dopamine, or norepinephrine (all different neurotransmitter chemicals that neurons use to signal one 
        |nother).  So it's no surprise that it's the same percentage of people that respond to treatment as time goes on and we 
        |evelop "new" drugs.  ////- "The mechanism of action of antidepressant medications is far more complex than their acute 
        |echanisms might suggest...However, all available antidepressants **exert their mood-elevating effects only after prolon
        |ed administration (several weeks to months)**, which means that enhanced serotonergic or noradrenergic neurotransmissio
        | per se is not responsible for the clinical actions of these drugs."////- Which means that there's some downstream effe
        |ts that are mediating the actual drug action we care about.  This explains why so many "depression" drugs work for thin
        |s like PTSD, anxiety, OCD, eating disorders, and chronic pain syndrome.  It's hardly a targeted thing, and different dr
        |gs probably have vastly different net effects past the increasing [insert chemical here] stage.  ////So yeah, there is 
        | lot of things we don't know but we have to keep on treating people because, hey, what else can we do in the meantime?/


            |Actually, the reason why there is a delay in SSRIs effects isn`t due entirely to downstream effects. The dessensiti
            |ation of autoreceptors (who when they detect flooding of the synapse inhibit firing) takes a few weeks, and that is
            |when the mechanism of increased serotonin starts working

            |great reply.  as I'm clinical, I appreciate the tools we have... combined with therapeutic approaches, we generally
            |do very well.  We're miles ahead of where we used to be.  Remember, despite the first bullet point, TCAs are FAR le
            |s effective than SSRIs.  The SSRI generation changed a lot for the better.


                |I was under the impression that in terms of efficacy MAOIA &gt; TCA &gt; SSRI, but that the side effect profile
                |of SSRI/SNRI/atypicals was so much better, that in most cases it was "good enough".


                    |noooooo ssri &gt; maoi = tca


        |I'm really happy that this was the top comment. Is there still concern that selective publishing of positive findings h
        |ve overestimated the benefits of SSRIs?


            |This was a real thing, no doubt.  Bad pharma was bad, and the withholding of negative studies was detrimental and p
            |ovided (ultimately) fodder for skepticism.  The current science around SSRI use tries its best to control for this 
            |mong other factors.  There is always that concern, and "source of funding" is a critical aspect of review of any pu
            |lication.  We should never relax against bias, whether it is financial, personal, or borne out of "desire to help."


                |Bad pharma is still bad.  You're throwing chemicals into children's brains and you have no idea what they're do
                |ng in there.////As someone who was a suicidal child myself, who kept getting pumped with drugs to treat my "dep
                |ession", ill tell you something right now:////If someone had been able to see that it was because I was being c
                |nstantly raped by a family member, they would have immediately understood the ramifications of what they were a
                |out to do to me-- which was to effectively chemically shut me up until adulthood.////You're sniffing at the wro
                |g end of this dog, doc.

        |I'd also like to add one thing about drugs used to treat anxiety disorders &amp; OCD. Cycloserine, an antibiotic used t
        | treat tuberculosis, [has been shown to be incredibly effective when used as an adjunct to exposure therapy.](http://ww
        |.healthemotions.org/symposium/set2.pdf) It's thought this works because it acts as an agonist for glutamine in NMDA rec
        |ptors. NMDA receptors are incredibly important in memory &amp; learning. Cycloserine isn't a drug used for maintenance 
        |f anxiety disorders. It's specifically used as a tool for exposure therapy, and is most effective if given within an ho
        |r, before or after, therapy. It also loses efficacy the more it's used. 


            |Glutamate is likely the next major wave of pharmacological agents.  It is unfortunately wrought with major side eff
            |cts and "exciting and promising" research that hasn't been fully fleshed out yet.  It's a promising field, and I've
            |remembered reading a meta-analysis of cycloserine in exposure therapy that was mostly positive.  Because I happen t
            | work alongside a world-expert in OCD, I asked this to her just now... it seems the effect may be more mild than we
            |initially hoped, but it still demonstrates some usefulness in improving the speed of recovery.


        |Just to add to the weirdness surrounding serotonin, buspirone (a direct serotonin receptor agonist) *also* takes 2-4 we
        |ks for therapeutic effect, and is not efficacious when dosed as needed. If simply adding serotonin was the required fix
        |this wouldn't really make sense; you should be fine for as long as buspirone was in your system.////In pharmacy school 
        |hey taught us an interesting hypothesis for this. Blocking SERT (the serotonin reuptake transporter) increases the amou
        |t of serotonin in the synaptic cleft...but this also ups the amount that can bind to inhibitory pre-synaptic receptors,
        |which for a while actually *decreases* natural serotonin production, until SERT is downregulated due to constant stimul
        |tion.  ////Similarly with buspirone, it displaces serotonin from its post-synaptic receptors, thus leaving more to acti
        |ate pre-synaptic receptors and again decrease production for a little bit. The reason its direct agonism isn't efficaci
        |us in and of itself may be due to the fact that it binds a specific receptor subtype, and this one may not be all that 
        |seful. However, if the hypothesis about how it eventually increases production of serotonin via downregulation of pre-s
        |naptic receptors is true, then this could explain that because the increased serotonin production would activate all re
        |eptor types.


            |So this is why depression and suicidal ideation can increase in the first few weeks after beginning an antidepressa
            |t?


                |That's actually usually attributed to the fact that antidepressants tend to restore energy before restoring moo
                |. 2-3 weeks after initiating therapy you might still be just as depressed, but suddenly be cured of the lack of
                |energy that went with it. Once your volition is restored you are in danger of acting on your depressed mood/tho
                |ghts by killing yourself.////I'm not entirely sure how that fits into the hypothesis I shared above; again, the
                |real complete answer to all of this stuff is, "These things work, we can prove it with data, but we really don'
                | know *how* they work.."


        |One of things I love in this topic is how anxiety is related to depression. While a lot of people might anecdotally sug
        |est that anxiety feeds into depression there is a really pretty cool mechanism for it. Cortisol (a hormone that gets ci
        |culated during periods of stress) seems to be a transcription factor for the serotonin transporter protein! One of my f
        |vourite things to mention when depression comes up.


            |I've not heard that explanation!  Can you send me a source sometime here or in pm?  I can hunt for it but i feel I 
            |ill forget amidst all the replies.


                |I'm unaware of any direct evidence that the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) is under control of the glucocortico
                |d receptor (Nuclear hormone receptor for cortisol).  But there's indirect evidence (in skin) (http://www.ncbi.n
                |m.nih.gov/pubmed/23161175), and there associations between regulatory regions of the serotonin transporter gene
                |and response to chronic stress (http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(09)01272-4/abstra
                |t), which suggests something is going on in the enhancer region of the gene under stress.//


                    |thank you!  Reading for me.


            |Once again, in English, please? Recovering hypochondriac dad here, with enough understanding of medicine to have *s
            |opped* with the over-the-top self-diagnosing. My 16 year old son was just started on an SSRI this week, and I'm try

                |its a proposed way that SSRI's may help anxiety.  Don't concern yourself dad.  Talk to your doctor!  SSRI's are

        |Thanks for such an in-depth answer. As someone with a crippling anxiety disorder I can only hope we find out why what w
        | have works so we can improve on it. 


            |that's how it works... we refine, refine refine!  I hope you find treatments that help.


        |Thanks for your extensive write-up. Two questions out of interest in this matter:  //What is your stance on the 'antide
        |ressants don't outperform placebo's' debate?  //What is your stance on the 'exercise is just as effective as antidepres
        |ants' debate?


            |My stance is what the current treatment tells us:  ////a) even if we include the negative studies, the SSRI effect 
            |n depression (NNT=6-10) and anxiety (NNT=3-5) is greater than placebo and both clinically and statistically signifi
            |ant.  ////b) I used to accept the science of the time that "for mild-moderate depression," SSRI's are the same as p
            |acebo/exercise/supportive therapies, however the more recent science pretty much debunks that... SSRI's are superio
            | for depressive and anxious symptoms vs. placebo in ALL levels (mild, moderate, and severe).  I haven't seen head-t
            |-head studies with exercise, but the effect of exercise is weak at best for anything more than a mild depression.  
            |///Depression is rarely due to "lack of effort," which is where the anecdotal effort to exercise seems to come from
            |////That being said, i routinely recommend exercise to all of my patients, not only for the mild psychological bene
            |it, but to the benefit of their entire health.////I'm sorry, I'm at work and cannot source this.  If it's important
            |to you, I will make an effort to do so.


                |I think a pretty good followup question is  -&gt; how good is the placebo? I believe there's some research show

                    |It is currently deemed unethical to give a patient a placebo treatment.  There are moments I struggle with 
                    |his, but overall, I agree.  There is VERY STRONG support that SSRI's are a better approach for anxiety and 
                    |epression anyway, so that adds to the ethical struggle.////Physicians used to write certain codes on prescr
                    |ptions to instruct the pharmacist to create a placebo.  This is no longer considered ethical.////**Also, pl
                    |cebo pills cause all of the side effects you mentioned above, as well as being less efficacious.**


                    |Side effects are collected in a catch all manner.  In trials, the rate of side effects of the active drug a
                    |e compared to placebo.  Even with placebo, patients still routinely report all of the above side effects ar
                    |und 1-2% of the time.  The actual side effects are those that are reported statistically significantly abov
                    | the frequency of the side effect in placebo.  All of the side effects found regardless of this comparison 
                    |re reported so that post-marketing data can be gathered to ensure that the studies didn't miss something si
                    |nificant.  SSRIs are generally considered a pretty benign drug that few patients discontinue due to side ef
                    |ects.  The older antidepressants before SSRIs had many more side effects and were thus harder for patients 
                    |o tolerate.

            |Thanks, Dr. Smartypants!


        |Interesting. SSRIs sound as though they have a similar mechanism to MDMA. Is MDMA an SSRI? If not, what differs? (obvio
        |sly chemical makeup, I am curious why MDMA would not fall in the SSRI category)////If this is a stupid question, much a
        |ologies, I'm not particularly familiar with biology


            |SSRI's block the reuptake of serotonin (and affect other receptors) which increases serotonin in the synapse.  MDMA
            |stimulates the release of MULTIPLE neurotransmitters including serotonin.  Because it effects the transporters that
            |normally keep serotonin in the presynaptic cell, it's kind of the same effect.  However, because MDMA stimulates th
            | release of the other neurotransmitters, it's not the same.////I will say, however, that proponents of MDMA recreat
            |onal use focus so much on serotonin with MDMA that it's a frustrating thing to witness.  MDMA is not an established
            |treatment for depression or anxiety.  I'm not against the research of it and its analogues, and I do believe if it'

                        |nformation.


                        |I think, particularly when it comes to psychedelics, you need to dis-aggregate "anxiety". Someone with 
                        |eneralized anxiety, who might be absolutely paranoid about any loss of control of bodily function, ment
                        |l process, or social inhibitions (a 'control freak'), will not have a good time on psychedelics unless 
                        |hat person receives a lot of help from fellow drug takers, or pairs that psychedelic with another drug

                        | phobia, post-traumatic stress, existential angst) might benefit from the clarity of mind and alternati

                        | therapeutic value.////What do you think of this reasoning?


                            |gotta say that as the skeptical guy i am, i start from a position of "interesting but doubtful" and
                            |try to convince myself.  There is so little evidence for me to say anything except "we'll see."  I'

                            |apy).


                        |This is just an anecdote, but I suffered from anxiety for quite a few years.  I took MDMA last year wit
                        | friends and my anxiety disappeared almost completely for the duration of the 'trip'.  I had been takin
                        | Mirtazepine for about a year before this and it helped, but it was nothing compared to this, it really
                        |felt like some 'miracle cure'.////I'm never going to take it again as I just wanted to try it once, but
                        |it was a pretty amazing experience.  I'm sticking with psychological solutions, I'm in the best state I
                        |ve been in and improving, I'll get over it eventually.


                            |there was a time that MDMA was used in psychotherapy without much ethical consideration... i think 
                            |here may be a place for MDMA research.  Street MDMA is just far too risky (check out http://www.ecs
                            |asydata.org/stats.php sometime!)


                    |We are currently studying LSD as an antidepressant here a at Kings College, London, UK. So far in trials wi
                    |h a psychotherapist it is showing more success than any commercial anti depressant available on the market.
                    |I work under Professor Nutt before anyone asks.


                |I do agree. I'd like to see more research. I think there is a lot of potential in MDMA. It is almost a shame th
                |t recreational use is so popular. That seems to have a lot to do with why MDMA is scheduled as it is in most de
                |eloped countries. I think the recreational obsession is somewhat of a hindrance to research in this area. 


                    |Yes, and to be fair, it shouldn't be.  The recreational use of MDMA is entirely different from its therapeu
                    |ic use.  I'm always astounded to see advocates for RECREATION tout it's use as a medicine.  The same "the s
                    |ience doesn't show it's harmful" arguments exist in the "the science doesn't show it's helpful" side, and y
                    |t every proponent shoves poor science down the naysayer's throats.////I am not anti-recreational use of a d
                    |ug, if it is safe.  I'm fine with evaluating safety.  Therapeutic use of a drug is NOT RECREATIONAL.  


                        |I think the most interesting line of research with respect to MDMA is it's effect on the mirror neurons
                        |and the implications for autism, rather than any comparison to SSRIs.////Even more fascinating is the i
                        |plications for cognition, which while largely unexplored to date, seem tauntingly obvious.  The same ne
                        |ral networks which aid in our own locomotion are activated when we see others perform the movements and
                        |are also implicated in our ability to empathize with another's thoughts - putting ourselves into their 
                        |ognitive rather locomotive shoes.  That's impressive abstraction for the network and might play a criti
                        |al role in abstract thought altogether.


                    |It is unfortunate that research is stifled by law, as many psychedelic compounds are potential therapies fo
                    | different psychiatric illnesses. But I think it is wrong to not allow people to explore their consciousnes
                    | with the use of these compounds. Check out maps.org to see what the latest research entails for things lik
                    | mdma assisted therapy for PTSD, ibogaine for addiction, psilocybin for end of life anxiety etc. some very 
                    |ool and wonderful stuff. 


            |SSRI's and MDMA do not have the same method of action. MDMA is a serotonin releasing agent, causing an abundance of
            |serotonin in the synapse by essentially dumping it all out.   SSRI's also increase available serotonin in the synap
            |e but via different mechanism which blocks the reuptake of serotonin that has already been released.   Taken togeth
            |r, SSRIs reduce the effects of MDMA by reducing the amount of MDMA transported to its primary point of action.  MDM
            | not only has effects on the serotonin system but has effects of the dopamine and norepinephrine systems as well.


            |The brain scans from the ABC documentary Ecstasy Rising showed that normal serotonin function was recovered after 2
            |3 months of ecstasy abstinence. I am under the impression that MDMA depletes serotonin reserves, while SSRI's block
            |re-uptake (keep them used longer). Also post-MDMA depression that lasts almost a week afterwards is a pretty common
            |user experience.


                |absolutely... for many drugs (heroin, cocaine, mdma, amphetamines), depression is definitely in the withdrawal.


        |&gt;That they work is not in question (despite what some prominent naysayers will claim), as the metaanalysis of many o
        | the SSRIs shows that they work, and they work both clinically and statstically more than placebo.////What do you make 
        |f the idea that they're merely "active placebos"? There seems to be a steady trickle of meta-analyses which which show 
        |ery little difference in effect size between conventional anti-depressants and a placebo with discernable side effects.


            |These meta-analyses are not as rigorous as I would like, and they discount some (obviously) impacting trends.  The 
            |ore sites a study uses, the higher the placebo rate.  So the "gold standard" - a multi-center randomized placebo-co
            |trolled study - may actually be not so golden - recruitment initiatives and payments, inappropriate criteria applic
            |tion, etc, feed into this, though it's not well understood.  When you control for this effect, the separation betwe
            |n drug and placebo becomes much more obvious.////I work with children and youth, and the evidence for SSRI's in chi
            |dren with ANXIETY is very compelling.  The evidence for SSRI's in children with DEPRESSION is *slightly* less compe
            |ling, but still statistically and clinically significant.   


            |I think a big factor here is that *placebo effect* is highly variable between institutions in all clinical trials, 
            |ut particularly those that involve self reported measures (pain, depression, anxiety--http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/p
            |bmed/8740611).  So the more sites you include in a study, the more variable the placebo effect is going to be, and 
            |he more that will increase error bars on effect sizes you compute.

        |Hey, I have a couple of questions. I'm actually happy that this post blew up on this sub - I was considering posting a 
        |imilar question myself. Why are anxiety and depression both treated with SSRI's? As someone who has mild anxiety, I jus
        | don't feel like being anxious is like being depressed at all. I feel panicky and my heart rate skyrockets when I'm anx
        |ous. I don't really know a lot about depression, but I think feeling sad/hopeless/unmotivated is completely different t
        |an being in a constant state of panic with a racing heart. How do SSRI's treat both mental illnesses even though they s
        |em completely unrelated and have completely different symptoms?////Also, why do SSRI's treat panic disorder? I understa
        |d panic disorder is pretty similar to anxiety disorders, especially GAD, but how is it that they can prevent panic atta
        |ks? Panic attacks are a whole cocktail of awfulness - panic, racing heart, numb face/limbs, chest pains/tightness, feel
        |ngs of heart attack/death, hyperventilation, faintness, nausea, heart palpitations, derealization, etc. How is it that 
        |ust messing with your serotonin prevents all those symptoms? It seems like serotonin has little to nothing to do with b
        |dily numbness, panic, heart palpitations, hyperventilation, etc.////These are questions that I've wondered since I star
        |ed taking SSRI's, so I would be very interested in any answer you have for me! 


            |why they are both treated with SSRI likely relates to a common neurological pathway.  both depression and anxiety a
            |e highly comorbid (if you have one you have a much greater chance of the other).  That being said, my answer doesn'
            | get much beyond that.////Anxiety, long term, can lead to depression.  Depression can have comorbid anxiety.  They 
            |re related, and having one increases the risk of the other.////The way that SSRIs work in panic attack is likely -a
            |most entirely- to do with the fear response and serotonin's role in it - the receptors don't completely match up bu
            | most of the studies, it looks like in our fear response centers (amygdala, limbic system), serotonin receptor inhi

            |That's like saying "we know our solar system "is dumbing it down.  A number of highly detailed mechanisms have been
            |proposed and are promising for the second messenger systems in antidepressant action.////SSRI treatment is a risk/b

            |reatment is the best option.  It's not a "large chemical hammer".   I do think it's a chemical hammer though, an im
            |recise tool we use to the best of our knowledge. Most people who take SSRI medications encounter none-to-nuisance s
            |de effects.


                |I think it's much better to be explicit about the fact that we're essentially just trying random shit, there is
                |no theory as to why this is effective, and as far as I know, we're nowhere close to developing one. We might be
                |close to finding more drug targets, but that's not even close to the same thing.////Sure, blunt instruments are
                |great in the face of disease, if you have nothing else. Radiation and chemotherapy were used to treat tumors lo
                |g before we understood the basis of cancer or why those treatments were efficacious.////But there is a huge dis
                |ervice being done to the public by people who describe depression, anxiety, etc. as a problem of serotonin leve
                |s, or mental health problems as a "chemical imbalance" in the brain more generally. That is bollocks, and it gi
                |es people the wrong idea about the nature of their problem and how it can or cannot be solved.////So, by all me
                |ns, continue to give people SSRIs, if it's effective and has few side effects. But let's not pretend we underst
                |nd what we're doing or the nature of the problem we're treating.


                    |you need to really better understand how medical science works.  Our understanding does not "pop in."  It d
                    |velops, through targeted experimentation, observation, and testing.////We understand a lot about the brain,
                    |way more than the generations before me did.  However, there is still much more to learn.  Why must you boi

        |Hi, ////I was wondering how a SSRI is different than something like sumatriptan (serotonin agonist?) prescribed for mig
        |aines. I don't really know how it works other than affecting something related to serotonin and I hope you can help!///
        |Thanks


            |Because of the multiple serotonergic activities of sumatriptan, it seems that it causes more anxiety and depression
            |as a side effect.  I've not seen any evidence of its use to treat depression.  Because the SSRI likely works throug
            | a balance of serotonergic AND second-messenger systems, I suspect sumatriptan is just too rawly serotonergic.////I
            |don't regularly work with sumatriptan, so I don't know too much more about that.

            |t's very complex and not that simple.


                |I don't know how related this is, but it's a thought I had. Some people say that when you give stimulant medica
                |ions to people with ADHD, it slows them down. And when you give the same medication to someone without ADHD, it
                |speeds them up. That's supposedly the main paradoxical effect of stimulants with respect to ADHD. But I don't t
                |ink that is entirely true. I believe that if you give *anyone* a low dose of a stimulant, it slows them down. I
                | you gave an ADHD individual more stimulant than they need, it speeds them up too. 


                    |I don't know the answer to it.  the textbook answer is that therapeutic doses of stimulants to people witho
                    |t ADHD have a similar side effect profile, with hyperfocus being increased.


        |In op's post, he says giving them More serontoin seems counter productive, but isnt that how ADD treatment works?////So
        | is it known why ADD medicine works and could it be for the same reason?


            |i mostly work with emergency psychiatry (Depression, suicide, psychosis, etc).  I'm not an ADHD expert, but the dop
            |minergic system is the one most implicted in ADHD, in the prefrontal cortex and ... some other area I forget.


        |How do you feel about the usage of deprenyl and / or the usage of psilocybin as a means to treat patients with depressi
        |n that have been otherwise unresponse to SSRIs or MAOIs? 


            |Psilocybin - not really my area to comment but very skeptical.////Deprenyl - MAOIs are tragically underused, due to
            |a overhyped, nonsensical approach to an unlikely side effect ("the wine and cheese effect").  The general algorhitm
            |I adhere to is:////(this is only for the pill side of the equation)////* Try SSRI 1 - to full tolerated dose////* S
            |itch to SSRI 2 - to full tolerated dose////* Switch to Non-SSRI - (Mirtazepine, venlafaxine, bupropion) based  upon
            |patient profile/selection (each has its side effect profile)//(my addition, most don'tdo this) Switch to MAO-I////*
            |consider combination therapy, consider diagnosis, consider symptomatic treatment, consider ECT


        |What's this I hear that statistical evidence suggests SSRIs are no better than placebos?  Even 60 minutes spent a segme
        |t interviewing these naysayers. Is this because placebos are very powerful psychological treatment devices or that the 
        |ata is being misinterpreted?


            |garbage in garbage out has part to do with it... the increasing placebo rate over the past 30 years and the correla
            |ion with larger studies and placebo rates has something to do with it.  Despite all of this, SSRI's are still super
            |or to placebo, but the bar is artificially raised by the recent trend of increasing placebo response.


        |Much like **acupuncture**, with respect to meta-studies supporting it, medical science not being able to really explain
        |it, and it working clinically.


            |acupuncture does not likely work clinically.  comparing it to sham treatments leads to negligible results. the proc
            |dure of acupuncture helps people, likely through expectancy/placebo.


        |To add to this- someone asked me the great question the other day of why does an ssri sometimes makes these symptoms wo
        |se? I have a friend doing research in this area and her response is basically that in some people, an ssri can actually
        |affect the receptors as well making them less able to receive the serotonin. I thought it was rather interesting and a 
        |ood thing to know when diving into clinical neuroscience. 


        |I've heard that after a time, SSRI's induce epigenetic methylation of neural DNA that could account for the delayed res
        |onse to the drug. Do you have any info on this?


            |I understood a portion of that!////No, in all seriousness, methylation and other processes of epigenetics are reall
            | taking off and I do my best to catch up, but I don't know enough to answer in a qualified way.////Epigenetics is a
            |huge component of 2010+ psychiatry, and I'm very excited as it also starts answering the nurture-nature question in
            |a very interesting way.


                |He is asking can SSRI's turn genes on and off in your brain/nerve cells. I wish people would add english after 
                |heir technobabble.


        |Have you heard anything about the efficacy of rTMS when treating depression and or mood disorders?


            |most studies show it to be of mild effect... perhaps moderate.  it's not as strong as most biological treatments, b
            |t seems to be very safe.


        |What do you think of the increased risk of suicide with SSRIs compared with placebo?


            |overhyped mostly, but an important black box warning... what we know:////treating depression with SSRI (NNT=5-7) fa
            | outweighs the risk of increased suicidal thinking (NNH=86+), and time to suicidal thinking is DECREASED with SSRI 
            |reatment.////likely, the initial scare was due to secondary outcome measure science rather than primary outcome mea
            |ure science, and the increase is likely very low.////In young people, I still warn about it.  the rate seems to be 
            |bout 1/80 to 1/125 of increased thinking vs. placebo, but clinically its much less.


        |[deleted]


            |this used to be true.  now, all studies must be registered with the federal government and must be reported on rega
            |dless of the outcome.  selective publication is no longer allowed.////bias, on the other hand, persists.  one must 
            |lways guard against it.////that being said, it's not all bullshit.  being aware of bias is important but it doesn't
            |invalidate the result.  but when non-biased sources confirm it, you feel better.

            |See above!  If they work, I suspect it is worth it.  If you don't feel that they are doing anything for you, then a
            |trial off of them is warranted.  Speak with your physician about it!


        |If we know that serotonin deprivation induces depression, then shouldn't tianeptine not work since increases reuptake o
        | serotonin?  Am I missing something here?


            |there are likely multiple pathways to depression.  we do not use SSRE medications in Canada so I have very little e
            |perience, sorry!


                |I'm still curious why we should think we know that serotonin deprivation induces depression.  An increase in se
                |otonin helping ease depressive symptoms doesn't show that a lack of serotonin causes depression.  If I put on a
                |blanket I'll be warmer, but I don't get cold because of blanket deprivation (at least not in the relevant sense
                |.


                    |the serotonin deprivation comes from very early studies (50s and 60s), where drugs and treatments that depl
                    |ted serotonin caused tremendous depression and anxiety.////a great overview of the serotonin hypothesis is 
                    |ere... though it doesn't mention the above://http://www.webmd.com/depression/features/serotonin


        |I dont know about the US but in the UK it is felt that SSRIs are ineffective in treating depression in those aged less 
        |han 18 years with fluoxetine being the only one to have limited evidence to support its use. Is there a physiological r
        |ason for this or is there just not enough research carried out in the subject? 


            |Probably the latter.   citalopram separates in youth as well.   for anxiety, all ssris save paroxetine are useful i
            | children. ////we need more child studies! ////interestingly.. no study of TCAs in children had ever separated from
            |placebo.   like.   ever. 


        |I'm pretty sure that the answer to this is we don't know but I'm going to ask anyway. During SSRI withdrawal I experien
        |ed brain zaps. I don't believe that is a technical term but I always wondered what the heck is actually going on under 
        |he hood. What is a brain zap?


        |What are you feelings on the current growing ideas behind the neuropsychological theory of antidepressant treatment? Wh
        |reby long acting antidepressant treatments (SSRIs) alter the balance of emotional and experiential processing from a mo
        |e negative bias to a more positive one, resulting long term in a change in appraisal of emotional stimuli. Catherine Ha
        |mer of Oxford University is leading the way in this growing area of research (http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/195/2/102.
        |ull, http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=101229&amp;RelatedWidgetArticles=true, http://www.sciencedi
        |ect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322309013195). In addition, could you give a psychiatrists view on recent advancements
        |in being able to tap into these biases by antidepressants in a preclinical setting? As I think it may help drug develop
        |ent in the future, not only in terms of drug screening but also reducing the number of non-effective treatments getting
        |into clinical trials (http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v38/n9/abs/npp201369a.html).


        |SSRI'S are the worst medication there is. I took prozac and eleva for 6 months and nearly committed suicide, i was so d
        |ssociated. Came off them and i still feel dissociated but a lot better and happier.


        |As you said, there are prominent nay-sayers, and let me preface this by saying I'm in no way "sinency". ////As you say,
        |it's a big unknown why SSRIs work, and many possibilities have been suggested, and you yourself, as you say, leave the 
        |why" up to the sincey folks. So taking that into account, is it possible that "Big pharma", for lack of a better genera
        |ization, is more interested in profit  than real working treatment? How likely is it that SSRIs really don't work that 
        |ell, and it's the attention, care and therapy that most often goes with it that makes the difference. Could this "big p
        |arma" be influencing studies that make it seem like SSRIs are effective? Perhaps not intentionally deceiving, but large
        | profit-seeking institutions are built around making their product preform well, and perhaps that becomes a self fulfil
        |ing goal.

    |7th year behavioral neuroscience graduate student here with a focus in drugs of addiction. I have also been taking SSRIs fo
    | 6 years, and I've read a lot about them and been to multiple lectures, classes, etc... ////While everyone is mostly right 
    |bout the actions of SSRIs and SNRIs, I wanted to add that there is a functional neuroanatomical component to this system th
    |t is being ignored. In short, there are many areas that help regulate the stress system (aka the hypothalamic-pituitary-adr
    |nal axis), which include the amyglada and hippocampus. SSRIs increase serotonin output onto these areas, and via second mes
    |engers increase brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BNDF). BDNF, in turn, increases dendritic branching and thus increases 
    |egulation of this dis-regulated HPA axis. This process usually takes about 3 weeks, and this is why SSRIs take a few weeks 
    |o work. ////Contrary to what DijonPepperberry stated, SSRIs may not even regulate the serotonin receptor density in the bra
    |n ([source](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0028390894900736)), but it may change the receptor sensitivity
    |and interactions with G-proteins ([source](http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v26/n5/abs/1395838a.html)). ////So, this is th
    | best answer I've gotten so far as to how SSRIs work and why it takes so long for them to work.  ////Here are some more in

        |You're probably more into the neoropharmacological side than I am, but I don't believe I've mentioned receptor density

        | best explanation for how SSRI's work and why it takes so long is still very much in the "proposed" category and not in
        |the "established" category.////We move closer every day.


            |I totally agree. I must have read your post wrong. I just wanted to clarify that action isn't only at the serotiner

            |all antidepressants except a very few (prozac being one) have significant discontinuation syndromes from stopping t
            |em immediately.  please consult your physician, as there are safe ways to stop taking medication.////SSRI discontin
            |ation syndrome should not be confused with addiction - if something benefits you, and treats an illness, it is a he
            |pful thing.  Stopping it causes discontinuation, in the same way that stopping high-blood-pressure pills can make y
            |ur blood pressure skyrocket.  This is not addiction, this is a rebound effect and a known phenomenon for many medic
            |tions.


        |Another reason why SSRIs take several weeks to kick in may more broadly be "altering gene expression takes a while."


    |I'm a medicinal chemist; my PhD thesis was on the development of new antidepressants.////Here is my understanding of the "s
    |ory" behind SSRIs and SNRIs:////In the 1950s, two anti-tuberculosis medications (isoniazid and iproniazid) were accidentall
    | found to be effective as antidepressants and later discovered to be a monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Their antidepr
    |ssant effect was then attributed to this activity, and chemists started making new MAOIs to improve their effectiveness.///
    |In the 1960s, Clomipramine (another MAOI) was discovered to relieve anxiety without causing either sedation or stimulation,
    |which was a common side effect of MAOIs. Researchers discovered that this drug primarily inhibited the reuptake of serotoni
    |, and correlated its biological effects with this pharmacological activity. The chemists got back to work and made a bunch 
    |f improved serotonin reuptake inhibitors which led to the SSRIs we know today (Prozac, Citalopram etc).////In recent years,
    |serotonin reuptake has been combined with noradernaline reuptake ihibition, as noradernaline is also closely associated wit
    | mood. This led to the SNRIs and SNRI/SSRI reuptake inhibitor drugs we use today. Why do we use them? Because clinical tria
    |s prove their effectiveness. How are they *supposed* to work? By increasing the amount of neurotransmitter floating about i
    | the brain. Why does this help with anxiety? More "successful" transmission of signals in mood-associated pathways in the b
    |ain leads to less anxiety and long-term structural changes on the micro and macro scale, helping the patient to overcome an
    |iety.////That's my two cents. I hope you enjoyed this history lesson helps to put things into context!


        |i truly love the history of medicine, thank you!

    |/**Here's the short version**. Stress hormones are regulated, in part, by the hippocampus. The hippocampus is degraded by e

    |Verbatim from Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics:////"SSRI treatment causes stimulation of 5-
    |T1A and 5-HT7 autoreceptors on cell bodies in the raphe nucleus and of 5-HT1D autoreceptors on serotonergic terminals, and 
    |his reduces serotonin synthesis and release toward pre-drug levels. With repeated treatment with SSRIs, there is a gradual 
    |own-regulation and desensitization of these autoreceptor mechanisms. In addition, down-regulation of postsynaptic //5-HT2A 
    |eceptors may contribute to antidepressant efficacy directly or by influencing the function of noradrenergic and other neuro
    |s via serotonergic heteroreceptors. Other postsynaptic 5-HT receptors likely remain responsive to increased synaptic concen
    |rations of 5-HT and contribute to the therapeutic effects of the SSRIs.////Later-developing effects of SSRI treatment also 
    |ay be important in mediating ultimate therapeutic responses. These include sustained increases in cyclic AMP signaling and 
    |hosphorylation of the nuclear transcription factor CREB, as well as increases in the expression of trophic factors such as 
    |DNF. In addition, SSRI treatment increases neurogenesis from progenitor cells in the dentate nucleus of the hippocampus and
    |subventricular zone (Santarelli et al., 2003). In animals models, some behavioral effects of SSRIs depend on increased neur
    |genesis (probably via increased expression of BDNF and its receptor TrkB), suggesting a role for this mechanism in the anti
    |epressant effects. Recent evidence indicates the presence of neural progenitor cells in the human hippocampus, providing so
    |e support for the relevance of this mechanism to the clinical situation (Manganas et al., 2007). Further, repeated treatmen
    | with SSRIs reduces the expression of SERT, resulting in reduced clearance of released 5-HT and increased serotonergic neur
    |transmission. These changes in transporter expression parallel behavioral changes observed in animal models, suggesting som
    | role for this regulatory mechanism in the late-developing effects of SsRIs (Zhao et al., 2009). These persistent behaviora
    | changes depend on increased serotonergic neurotransmission, similar to what has been demonstrated clinically using depleti
    |n strategies (Delgado et al., 1991)."//////O'Donnell JM, Shelton RC. Chapter 15. Drug Therapy of Depression and Anxiety Dis

    |So... is there no point in going on them at all then, I'm reading in these comments that they work just as well as talk. I'
    | an extremely depressed person and am wary about trying an SSRI because I don't want it to push me into a further depressed
    |suicidal state. I also don't want to stay how I am now. Is it worth it if I combine it with cognitive therapy? Or should i 
    |ot even bother 


        |I think support systems and having someone to talk to is critically important in reinforcing the effects of both CBT an
        | antidepressant treatment. There are growing theories in the depression literature that antidepressant activity may be 
        |ased not only on the extensive science discussed in this askreddit, but also the way in which we perceive and remember 
        |xperiences we have. This means that antidepressants (and perhaps CBT) may act to remediate depression through making pa
        |ients perceive everyday interactions and subsequent memories of those activities more positive, such that the overwhelm
        |ng negativity or anhedonia towards life or activities are reduced. The reason I believe seeking support throughout your
        |treatment is important is because it will help to reinforce these effects. This is area if you're interested is known a
        | the neuropsychological theory of antidepressant treatment and Catherine Harmer from Oxford University has been one of 
        |he frontrunners in building it (http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/195/2/102.full). Hope this helps and you seek the treatm

    |m see almost everything as threatening, and it's easy to see that SSRIs may help with that, as they help with similar negat

    |be no doubt they were the most effective drugs for anxiety.

        |Out of curiosity where did you get your information? It seems to be off. At least from my understanding. I am talking f
        |om experience as I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia and have spoken with psychiatrists and therapists 
        |n this subject.////&gt;It can sometimes be linked to depression, but often isn't.////This is the main reason I logged o
        | and commented, because from my understanding this is wrong. ////&gt;Anxiety disorders are often comorbid with other me
        |tal disorders, particularly clinical depression, which may occur in as many as 60% of people with anxiety disorders. //
        |/Source: http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/understanding-comorbid-depression-and-anxiety////I also wanted to add
        |that Sertraline helped me A LOT personally. Just as much if not more then the CBT therapy I did for half a year. I have
        |been off/done with both since February and have had no large anxiety spikes nor panic attacks luckily! //////////////


            |From my clinical psychology textbooks and various journals over the years. That estimate is the highest I've seen f
            |r comorbidity by quite a long way, and certainly in panic disorder the rate is nowhere near that. The rate is defin
            |tely significant, but what I was saying was depression and anxiety are not the same thing as far as we know.////If 
            |ertraline helped you, that's great; it does help some people. Just not all. It's never going to be as effective a t
            |eatment for anxiety as benzodiazepines. And i wouldn't call either a cure.


    |Sort of a follow-up question: What causes the sexual side effects of certain SSRI's? I'm currently on Lexapro and my stamin
    | has gone from average to "Are you done yet?" and sometimes I can't orgasm at all. 


        |Upregulation of serotonin generally (since that's what you're doing by inhibiting serotonin reuptake transporters or SE
        |Ts) leads to serotonin increase at several different types of serotonin receptors. Some are more linked to anxiety (5-H
        |2a, for example; this one is also stimulated by LSD and gives you hallucinations, and is inhibited therefore by 5-HT2a-
        |pecific antagonists to treat schizophrenia) while others like 5-HT3, if overstimulated by serotonin, may lead to sexual
        |dysfunction. It's a rather unfortunate side-effect of specifically the antidepressants that target serotonin (including
        |SSRIs, SNRIs, TCADs, and I presume MAOIs/alpha 2 antagonists).////BUT! NDRIs, or norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhib
        |tors, actually don't affect serotonin and therefore don't have sexual side-effects (or weight gain). Different set of p
        |tential side-effects here though; increasing dopamine may precipitate psychosis, especially in schizophrenics, and the 
        |rug may induce a tremor, anxiety, and insomnia.////As a 2nd-year med student I can't exactly tell you "well you should 
        |bviously switch to X medication," but if you truly hate that sexual side-effect, it may be worth a shot to have a chat 
        |ith your PCP about an NDRI like wellbutrin.


        |I was on lexapro for a while but had to stop because of the sexual side effects. Ask your doctor about Wellbutrin. I'm 
        |n it now and not only does it treat my depression/anxiety better than lexapro, I can still bang like a race horse.


    |I would like knowledgeable people to shed some light on this:////Some people say it takes an SSRI weeks to work. Some peopl
    | say they can notice effects in less than 1 day. If we exclude placebo effect, what is different about the people who notic
    | effects in less than 1 day?
