            |As a Brit, the closing of a fucking Canyon seems fucking ridic.


    |lol he can't possibly keep the whole place closed with one sign. 


    |I'd still go see the Grand Fissure.


    |well............ good luck with that!!//


    |exact same cloud formation... hmmm


    |The scenic shot just makes our sanctions on nature, like this, seem so arbitrary and subjective.////The clouds just billow 
    |long like "w/e dude"//


    |I'm pretty the sure the photo on the right has been shopped, I've seen quite a few shops in my time. 


        |I thought it was the left one thst was the shop


    |Grand Crack is awesome.  


    |Seriously, this is the actual problem in a picture. If government thinks they need to staff the canyon, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.


    |IS THIS SAUL FROM BATTLE STAR GALACTICA????


    |It looks like a fractal set


    |shuts down everything you can

        |Why outsiders, Father? 


    |It's cool to imagine the editing of this image. It seems to show that the land grows closer together, stretching itself out
    |of time and making straighter gaps in the earth. ////The top and the bottom of the image are identical, but the land got cl
    |ser together. So, it didn't just scoot down into the gap.//This would be a cool gif to watch.


    |This just reminded me of a really delicious brownie or cake


    |Grand Canyon's on Native American land. Glad I can still visit anytime.


    |This one sign is going to prevent me from going inside? Okay. 


    |It took me far to long to get this.


    |You know what would have been funny. Evel Knievel walking away from the sign with his head down George Michael style. 


    |Has science gone too far?


    |Obama closed it out of spite..am I right? why the hell would you spend more guarding it than paying to keep it open???


        |&gt;Obama////Congress.  


            |No, Don't you know?////The rest of the entire government is perfect and not corrupt. It's just that 1 guy.


    |I don't get it what the hell is so funny about this?!


        |Yeah... it's not really "funny." It's more like "Heh, yeah that's about right" material.


        |What's funny is that when the sign meant it was closed, it meant it was closed for viewing by the public as there's no 
        |ederal workers to oversee the activity, but OP took it in a literal tone and photoshopped an image of the canyon physic
        |lly closing to make it just a crack rather than a canyon.


    |THE GRAND CANYON MIGHT BE CLOSED. BUT YOUR MOM IS NOT.


        |...and both the grand canyon and your mom can be seen from orbit.


    |Land of the free.....but you can't even go and see it's national wonders.....what a joke


        |The existence of national parks, open or closed, should not be taken for granted.////http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natio
        |al_park


            |Yay! I just watched Ken Burns' National Parks because of this shutdown and I feel the same way!


        |Maybe you shouldn't have shut down the government then.


    |"That'll teach those Democrats!"


    |My husband and I have a long-standing joke that's relevant!////In our first month as a couple we went on a trip to the gran
    | canyon, first time for both of us. We showed up early morning, just before sunrise, and we couldn't see the canyon... It w
    |s dark, there were too many trees, and we weren't sure where the road was taking us. ////We drove for a few minutes, then s
    |arted joking that the Grand Canyon was gone, we missed it! They closed the attraction and relocated it to China. It now res
    |ded on the south side of the Great Wall of China as a surprise to invading Huns (I get my history from Mulan...) and they r
    |named it The Grand Death Trap. Let's turn around!////Moments later we saw that canyon as the tress opened up and bricks wer
    | shat. We still call it the Grand Death Trap to this day.


    |Hmmmm. My wife's vagina did the same thing. 


    |I'm just glad they finally fixed that thing.


    |The US government is a fucking joke.


    |Ron Swanson Sr.? 


    |how the fuck can a canyon be closed? america srsly ...


    |Can someone please explain why they close places that really don't need people to run? I can understand buildings and stuff
    |getting closed but do they really need to close something that requires nobody but yourself to look at


    |Even the Earth is like "Y'all need to find a way to help each other. Until then, I'm closing some areas and opening others 
    |BOOM Yellowstone explodes)." 


    |Technically that's not the Grand Canyon, it's part of the Little Colorado just to the east of the GC.  It's just outside th
    | borders of the park.


    |Looks like a winking Sphincter


    |No looking!


    |You know, there is a bunch of unguarded offroad trails that lead into the Grand Canyon. Have you been to the southwestern s
    |de of the Grand Canyon or did you just leave the same way you arrived? ////Some people making these comments probably have 
    |ever been to the Grand Canyon.


    |Government so annoying, even the butthole of the earth clenches.


    |Where's the "Detour" sign?


    |That Grand Canyon is very tight butthole//


    |Tight Butthole.


    |I got scared a little bit. I though the pictures were actual before/after photos and that the park was closed because the g
    |vt didn't want people to see what was happening.


    |A funny post with a deeper meaning is truly the best.


    |You have to pay to see the Grand Canyon, are you having a fucking laugh? 


    |ypu know I don't really see the humour in this...especially with the shutdown going on. ..I mean that's people out of work 
    |nd tourism money not coming in...you understand why its more ironic and not funny?


    |They're reopening the Grand Canyon!////http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/state/government-shutdown-update-gov-jan-brewer-negoti
    |tes-deal-to-reopen-grand-canyon-national-park


    |It's been reopened or will be in the next few days. Someone switch the picture round and prepare to reap the karma.


    |Is this what you typically find in creationism news sites?


    |You made me think of the Grand Canyon as a butthole.


    |tight butthole


    |If I went there, I would steal that sign. Both as an outlet for my frustration, and as it is a piece of history.


    |I thought this was going to be a joke about my mother//


    |http://i.imgur.com/3HoShM2.jpg


        |Is that Kurt Vonnegut's drawing of an asshole?


            |It looks more like a cat's anus.


        |E. Pluribus Anus


        |I... what?


    |Maybe if the old man in the pic did a jigg on the road to entertain other dissappointed people, shit would work itself out.


    |Someone bring in rumplestilskin and say his name. It'll open right up again.


        |and then close again once he's split in two and swallowed by it..////Enough time for pictures?


    |lol


    |What is stopping you from just going around him?


        |Apparently there are still law enforcement guys who are working just to give tickets to people who come on the parks wh
        |n there aren't regular rangers that actually do real work around.


    |This shit was on the frontpage when I went to bed a few hours ago why the hell is it on there again? C'mon people, get it t
    |gether.


    |You can't just CLOSE the Grand Canyon.


        |Yea you can. Its on Native land.


            |I meant it in the sense that its the fuckin Grand Canyon. Its always gonna be there.


    |You can still visit the grand canyon through the native reservation! 


        |They don't allow outsiders.


    |Random comment.////A random downvoter will downvote me anyways. 


    |Much of the Grand Canyon in on private property, just go to one of the many Injun gates (who owns much of the "park") and p
    |y a fee much less than the "american" side and enjoy the park./////I've enjoyed the park on the Injun side many times////


    |[Less than 12hrs and we have a Repost](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1o8v2l/my_dad_after_6_months_of_trip_planning_

        |I don't think you know what the word repost means.


            |I don't understand why you are being downvoted for this
