The stomach naturally produces more stem cells than previously realized, likely for repair of injuries from infections, digestive fluids and the foods we eat.(/r/science)




    |Is it wrong to say that the stomach produces stem cells when the cells in question are other specialized cells that revert 
    |ack to stem cells when needed? Also, as I understand it, stem cells can turn into many different kinds of cells, but I wasn
    |t aware that cells could revert back to a stem cell state. Can someone help clear all this up a little more?


        |Stem cells initially are termed 'pluripotent' meaning they can differentiate (turn into) many types of specialized cell
        |. They follow a sort of map, change into types of cells, which allows them to further specialize and differentiate unti
        | they reach the 'terminal differentiation' point. What scientists have recently found is that it may not be so terminal
        | Certain cell populations can revert back or signal the production of stem cells due to injury stimuli. Mammals aren't 
        |ery good at this but reptiles and amphibians can use stem cells to regenerate substantial parts of their body. A lab in
        |Japan recently developed iPS cells. They are induced pluripotent stem cells. They take a skin biopsy and through a fair
        |y simple protocol can develop a line of stem cells based on an individual patient. They can then use those stem cells t
        | grow all types of cells using that persons genetic background opening the door for personalized medicine.

                        |Are ethical considerations really holding us back?////I would have thought that if stem cells were so c
                        |pable the research would simply relocate to other countries and/or states that don't have these ethical

                    |They still need to work out more of the kinks in the technique before it can safely be used therapeutically
                    |(as opposed to for research purposes). Accordingly, regulatory bodies in the US and Europe do not currently
                    |allow iPS cells to be used therapeutically. Furthermore it still has a much higher failure rate than embryo
                    |ic stem cells.////Hopefully, however, iPS can be made more reliable in the coming decades. It promises a fe
                    | advantages over embryonic stem cells, such as the ethical issue as well as (in some cases) lower susceptib

                        |Is the lower rejection due to using the patient's cells vs. another person's embro cells?  What about i
                        | someone kept their own embro cells for later in life?


                            |You cannot save your embryonic cells for later because, as far as current technology is able to rel
                            |ably do, removing an embryonic stem cell leads to death of the embryo (even though, theoretically, 
                            |emoving a cell shouldn't affect much).////We might suppose a lower rejection rate with induced plur
                            |potent cells because if we can create a personalized treatment derived from a patient's own skin ce
                            |ls, then there would be no immune rejection.////With that said, it will probably be much cheaper an
                            | easier to mass-produce treatments derived from an existing stem-cell line (either induced-pluripot

                            |use of a lentiviral vector carrying 4 transgenes (Oct4, Sox2, KLF4, and MYC) that are sufficient to
                            |revert a somatic cell back into a pluripotent state.  Lentiviruses work by incorporating these gene
                            | into the genome at random and multiple locations.  Initially, it was worrisome that incorporation

            |such as the adult stem cells found in your bone marrow) can turn into a limited number of cell types, such as fat a

            |nitor, for instance, turns into heart cells or blood vessel cells).  And some progenitor cells (myoblasts - muscle 
            |rogenitor) only turn into 1 cell type (muscle).  Stem cells are generally responsible in the body for helping diffe
            |entiate and repair injuries, which is why it makes sense that the stomach (high turnover in cells) would have a bas

        |renewing epithelium of the gastric corpus occurs almost exclusively in the isthmus of the glands, from where cells migr
        |te bidirectionally toward pit and base. The isthmus is therefore generally viewed as the stem cell zone. ////So the cor
        |us (latin for 'body') of the stomach is basically the main part of the stomach. In the inner lining of the stomach the 
        |pithelium has many glands producing a variety of proteins, gastric acid, etc. The isthmus is a central region of this g
        |and that has classically been considered to be the 'stem cell' zone where cells migrate in both directions (look at the
        |image) both upwards and downwards into the base.////&gt; We find that the stem cell marker Troy is expressed at the gla
        |d base by a small subpopulation of fully differentiated chief cells.////So yes, these cells at the base they studied ar
        | a special population of the fully differentiated cells (ie, something we *wouldn't* call a stem cell). Chief cells are
        |the cells in these gastric glands responsible for producing enzymes that help start the digestion process.////&gt; By l
        |neage tracing with a Troy-eGFP-ires-CreERT2 allele, single marked chief cells are shown to generate entirely labeled ga
        |tric units over periods of months. This phenomenon accelerates upon tissue damage.////This is the important part of the
        |r finding. That using fluorescent tags they were able to observe the movement of the original cells at the base, and fo
        |nd that they were basically able to reproduce all the cells in a single unit (ie, from the bottom they saw it move into

        |produce the other types of cells in the gland.////&gt;Troy+ chief cells can be cultured to generate long-lived gastric 
        |rganoids.////This just means that they can use these cells in a lab environment to produce a collection of gastric glan
        |s that can maintain themselves (ie, replace dead/dying cells and keep it alive and working).////&gt;Troy marks a specif
        |c subset of chief cells that display plasticity in that they are capable of replenishing entire gastric units, essentia
        |ly serving as quiescent “reserve” stem cells. These observations challenge the notion that stem cell hierarchies repres
        |nt a “one-way street.”////So this just concludes by saying that these marked cells seem to serve as reserve stem cells,
        |that under normal circumstances they just go about their business (quiescent meaning resting/dormant), but when called 
        |nto action by the stomach are able to replace all the other cells in this gastric unit.////That's just the abstract, I 
        |aven't read the full article yet. But I just wanted to also address a few of your questions. The word 'stem cell' itsel
        | is quite arbitrary, meaning that there are many things we call stem cells that may not really be 'true' stem cells, an
        | the word is used in so many different ways that it can get scientists and the public confused. For instance what we te
        |d to call a haematopoietic stem cell that originates the various types of blood cells isn't really a 'true' stem cell i
        | that it's already fairly differentiated itself, but is able to produce many subtypes of other cells. So really you sho
        |ld think of these as progenitor cells, as they are quite organ specific and not akin to the stem cells people usually t
        |ink of (like embryonic stem cells). The word we use doesn't really matter as much as understanding what it can/can't do
        |(which also changes with our ever evolving understand of them).////And also with regards to 'reverting' back to a stem 
        |ell, it does exist and it's called dedifferentiation. Although our understanding isn't clear, it has been implicated in
        |being involved in the formation of tumours and cancers for instance. But again bear in mind that these 'stem cells' may
        |be closer to a fully differentiated cell type than the stem cells the public like to think of.


            |It's really quite incredible how our bodies work,  and this is jUst scratching the surface. 


                |... and then they repair that surface.

                |&gt;For science


        |In the most general sense, Stem Cells (SCs) are cells meant for maintaining cell populations -- they're resistant to mu
        |ation, divide slowly, and don't really have much function besides eventually becoming differentiated cells, which lose 
        |he ability to divide, but gain a necessary function instead. ////Stem cell niches (populations ) are very carefully reg
        |lated and a stem cell can divide symmetrically to produce two stem cells, +1 to replenish the population, they can divi
        |e asymmetrically to create a differentiated cell and a stem cell, +0, or they can divide to form two differentiated cel
        |s, -1 to a popultion. //This is key in areas like the GIT(GastroIntestinalTract), where epithelial lining is constantly
        |sloughed (shedded) and so stem cell niches need to be carefully situated, e.g. your intestine's Krypts of Lieburkhins, 
        |o these maintained populations can differentiate and replace dying cells.//It's also similar to your muscles and their 
        |atellite cells -- little popuations of stem cells used, i.e. differentiated into more functional cells, when muscle dam
        |ge occurs, e.g. from working out. ////We can force de-differentiation, reversion to a more naïve state, or trans-differ
        |ntiation, basically partial de-differentiation then guided differentiation to a similar state, by playing with intrinsi
        | factors (the genetics and epigenetics within a cell) as well as the extrinsic factors (signals outside the cell), but 
        |hese processes don’t really occur naturally unless you're on the road to cancer. Trans-differentiation is often easier 
        |han producing artificial, fully naive cells when using two similar populaions, e.g. Hepatic (liver) cells trans-differe
        |tiating to Pancreatic Beta cells (Insulin-producing pancreas cells), since they share a common lineage not that far bac
        |. As far as sharing cell-fates goes... Well, before going into that here's a quick primer on germ layers. ////All of th
        | cells in your body were derived from naive/potent/de-differentiated cells arising from one of three germ layers... The
        |Ectodermal layer (Neurons, Skin, Nails..etc), the Mesodermal layer (Muscles, Heart, Gut, Kidneys...etc) or the Endoderm
        |l layer (Trachea, Bronchi, Liver&amp;Pancrease...etc). Now that you know what those three germ layers are,  here's a su
        |mary of what stem cells can actually be in terms of potency (Their potential to differentiate into various lineages)://


            |Totipotent SCs -- Can become any embryonic lineage (Endo/Meso/Ectoderm) or Extra-embryonic lineage (includes placen
            |a). //--&gt;This would be the initial zygote cell, i.e. fertilized cell.////Pluripotent SCs – Can become any embryo
            |ic lineage (Endo/Meso/Ectoderm). //--&gt;This would be when your unicellular-zygote has divided to about 16 cells t
            | form a morula then a blastocyst with separate populations for extra-embryonic tissue (Tropho), and embryonic tissu
            | (Inner Cell Mass).// These are the famous stem cells everyone thinks about, ESCs or Embryonic Stem Cells, and are 
            |ontroversial as they’re derived from an embryo.////Multipotent SCs – Can become multiple lineages/fates, but only w
            |thin ONE germ layer. //--&gt;This could be germ layer cells the moment they split, i.e. an Ectodermal cell that can
            |become skin/hair/nails/neurons, or a less naïve / more differentiated and lineage-restricted cell that still mainta
            |ns multiple potential fates, e.g. your hematopoietic progenitor cells that can become numerous immune/blood cell ty
            |es.////Unipotent SCs – Can only become one cell fate, but are still Stem Cells that maintain and replenish certain 
            |opulations. A good example of this would be the precursor populations that maintain your spermatocytes. ////(I shou
            |d also add that there’s technically a step between Multipotent and Unipotent, Oligopotent, but it’s really just a m
            |ltipotent SC with further differentiation/lineage-restriction...////An example of the jump between Multi-to-Oligo p
            |tent would be a hematopoietic progenitor cell that can become multiple myeloid lineages (Red blood cells, white blo
            |d cells, neutrophils..etc) AND lymphoid lineages (T-Cells, B-Cells, NK-Cells…etc) and is thus MULTIpotent. The mome
            |t this progenitor differentiates / restricts itself to a myeloid or lymphoid lineage it becomes OLIGOpotent, and ca
            | now only differentiate into the multiple fates from either one lineage or the other // -- i.e. either TCells/BCell
            |/NKCells or Neutrophils/RedBloodCells/WhiteBloodCells...etc


                |Oh and to give a general run down of some of these terms I keep throwing out there -- here's an example of a St
                |m Cell's fate with a summary at the end...////1)Fertilized Zygote can become Embryonic or Extra-embryonic tissu
                |//{Totipotent}//////2) Once sufficiently divided, some of these Totipotent cells differentiate into an Inner Ce
                |l Mass population only capable of becoming Embryonic tissue //{Inner Cell Mass is now PluriPotent} //////3) The
                |e Pluripotent Inner Cell Mass cells now further differentiate to split into 3X populations --  Ectoderm cells, 
                |esoderm cells and Endoderm cells. //{Each population is Multipotent}////4) Following one of these populations, 
                |ome of the Endoderm cells will split and differentiate into Hematopoietic SCs. //While still Multipotent like E
                |doderm cells, they're now more differentiated than naive Endoderm cells and can no longer become the other Endo
                |ermal lineages such as the Gut or Cardiovascular cells... //Their lineage and fate is restricted because they'r
                | becoming increasingly specific and gaining more and more functions suitable to only one role...//////5) These 
                |ematopoietic progenitors will now split into a lymphoid (potential B-Cells/T-Cells/NK-Cells) or myeloid lineage
                |(Includes various Red Blood Cell or White Blood Cell types).//{These cells are now Oligopotent, until they're r
                |stricted to a single fate/potency}////Each step, 1--&gt;2--&gt;3--&gt;4--&gt;5 Captures the basic concept of St
                |m Cells... //As a cell gains specific function and adapts to survive in a specific environment, i.e. as a cell 
                |IFFERENTIATES, it loses POTENCY (The ability/potential to form various cell types) and thus its fate and lineag
                | becomes limited -- a term called LINEAGE-RESTRICTION. Cells with less lineage-restriction are termed NAIVE, be
                |ause they've undergone little change from primordial cells, can still divide, and are less limited in what they
                |can become//////...Whew, that's a way to kill 20m. I wrote this all from memory and I'm not an expert in the fi
                |ld, so fell free to correct or challenge me on any of this if I'm wrong, and if anyone wants something further 
                |lucidated I'll try my best... Had an awkward time balancing correct descriptions with laymen's terms so most of
                |what I wrote is heavily simplified.//


        |Can a stem cell turn into a stem-cell maker?


            |A stem cell is a stem cell maker, every cell that is called a stem cell has three basic principles:////1. they are 
            |apable of self-renewal//2. it is not fully "specialized"//3. can give rise to "specialized" cells////So yeah every 
            |tem cell is a stem cell maker. If they all would just become "stomach cells" none would remain.


                |Thank you.


                |Given this, why can't we clone/"renew" infinite embryonic stem cells from one embryo?


                    |You could in theory. In practice these cells are very sensitive. There is a very good illustration in an ar
                    |icle about cell fate determination. It looks like a pinball machine.//The cell starts from the top and goes
                    |to the bottom. There are a lot of things that can direct its way during that way, outside, inside, factors,
                    |expression patterns, physical changes etc. It bounces down and arrives at specified fate. This could be ski
                    | cells, liver cells etc. [Article](http://biologie.univ-mrs.fr/upload/p56/allis_et_bemstein.pdf) It is on t
                    |e 3rd page.////Now just intuitively if you think about it where is easier to keep the ball? At the bottom y
                    |u have to do nothing and the ball stays there. At the top the ball requires some interaction to stay there.
                    |This is very true it is a challenge to keep embryonic stem cells undifferentiated, even with the best metho
                    |s some of them spontaneously differentiate into something, then you have some muscle cells, or brain cells 
                    |r blood cells among the stem cells. The chance of them spontaneously differentiating goes up the more they 
                    |re kept in the undifferentiated state.////To add to this every time the stem cells divides there is a chanc
                    | one of the new cells will start differentiating down the line so every cell division also carries a risk o
                    | the cells spontaneously differentiating.//Finding out how to keep cells in an undifferentiated state for a
                    |long time is a very heavily researched area. Just like you pointed out it would mean we could have almost i
                    |finite embryonic stem cells to research on.////The other thing is, yes in theory these cells could self ren
                    |w infinately. In practice this just means a long time compared to other cells. In a petri dish or culture a
                    |ter some time these cells can die.////If we could solve these problems there is still a problem before trea
                    |ment. An embryonic stem cell does carry the immune compatibility of the individual. So if I take an embryon
                    |c stem cell from an embryo and put it in my liver or generate a new liver out of it, it would be killed by 
                    |y immune system instantly. Or I will have to take immunosuppressive medication with all of the side effects
                    |////So to make stem cells for my treatment you are going to need:////- my embryonic stem cells(pretty hard,
                    |you are going to need a time-travelling device and since gathering embryonic stem cells kills the embryo, I
                    |will not be born) or //- don't use embryonic stem cells, use a different kind harvested from my body(like H
                    |SC or hematopoietic stem cells taken from my bone marrow) or //- use induced pluripotent stem cells that we
                    |e made from my cells so they are 100% compatible with my immune system.////I beleive the last option is the
                    |best, we don't need to kill embryos for stem cells, we don't need eggs from a woman, we just need skin cell
                    |, or [a urine sample with some cells in it](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v7/n12/full/nprot.2012.115.
                    |tml), a couple of scientific magic cocktails and we have a cell that is essentially like an embryonic stem 
                    |ell. If this method is perfected, in the future stem cell therapy will skyrocket, because they are essentia

    |Judging from a dozen different medical papers, a theory that hasn't yet jelled is an odd one, but one that needs to be exam

        |Strictly speaking it's not "inflammation" but the cytokines produced by immune cells. Depending on the cytokine chemica

            |I didn't want to bring that up, because there are so many parallel functions to cytokines, including histamines and

                |the abdominal wall and into the matured follicule, then the egg can be sucked out. It is preferable to harvest

                |e assisted pregnancies have an increased chance to be twins or multiple twins.////So the eggs that are harveste
                | from women are in fact unfertilized, but they were harvested artificially, they could have become a natural pr

                        |ainst this method. Those cells will be thrown out and destroyed anyway, they could be used to further s
                        |ience. I for one can very much justify using those cells. ////Problem is there are not many of them. Un
                        |erstandably during assisted reproduction doctors are trying to have no "leftover" cells, nothing should
                        |go to waste, still there remains a few, but not every time. Second problem is not many clinics and doct
                        |rs doing assisted reproduction know that they could(with the consent of the patient) donate these cells
                        |to stem cell research or they have the same concerns regarding this field as the general public, so the
                        | refuse.////Using harvested eggs only for the purpose of making stem cells in my opinion is a bit waste
                        |ul even when a woman donates it freely. There are finite number of those cells and every one of them co
                        |ld produce a healthy child, I could see why it is shaky to just gather and use simply donated eggs when
                        |there are lots of infertile couples trying to finally have a child, either through egg donation, or ado
                        |tion etc.////If we could somehow harvest eggs that went through normal ovulation, did not get fertilize
                        | and about to be ejected out from the body during the menstrual cycle, well that would be easier to jus
                        |ify. Unfortunately this would mean a single egg, and you would have to wait a month for the next one an
                        | until that store the first one somehow in a freezer. Complicated, slow and not guaranteed you even get
                        |perfect fertile eggs or find an egg at all, it could have broken down before menstruation. This method 
                        |s not really feasible.


    |Great explanation here on this as this is the first time I've heard of the cells specifically repairing previous damage.  W
    |uld this eventually lead to helpful treatments of those battling cancer in this region?


    |As a person with chronic GERD, I hope this is true.


    |The body is an amazing thing how knows what elese its hiding from us


    |The stomach is our primary brain... it is truly a superior organ.


    |For repair of the foods we eat?


        |From the foods we eat. I know my stomach needs repairs from those margaritas, chips, and jalapeños from last night. 


    |I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but does anyone know, or have an idea, how long it's going to be until rest
    |ration of body parts will be a thing? I'm really hoping that the technology will be able to reverse a circumcision in my li
    |etime, but others obviously have more important needs for the technology. 


        |There was a great episode on Friends about that... "A California Roll".


            |Link? They talked about stem cells on friends? Seems a bit early?


    |So, what's the best way to support the growth if stem cells in my stomach?////e.g. diet, exercise, lifestyle, etc.


    |Ahhh ////Stem cells. That makes more sense than sperm cells////Was confused for a minute there


    |Is this why animals lick their injuries?


        |Unless they've been hurling their stomach contents regularly, no. Saliva (along with tears) generally have an enzyme ca
        |led lysozyme that degrades bacterial cell walls, killing the bacteria.


            |Plus, wounds are tasty.


    |so christopher reeves never had to eat all dem babies?


    |Is this maybe why drugs like lovenox can be derived from pork stomach? ////Don't mind me, I'm not a scientist 


    |Maybe this is an explanation to how [Michel Lotito](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Lotito) survived all those years.


    |Next big thing for the churches to go after "Do not make humans from feces"... any bets?


    |My friend's girlfriend's dad is one of the researchers in this paper. Would anyone be interested if I got him to do an AMA 
    |r something similar?////No promises, but it's worth a shot.


    |I just ate some taco bell and im pretty sure my stomach is producing some serious stem cells right at this very moment


    |i'm just astonished how advance the human body is yet developing robot seems to be giving more importance then preserving a
    |d improving the condition of current living humans. 


        |Trying to build mechanical creatures may give insight to how some of us fleshy creatures work. 


        |&gt;  developing robot seems to be giving more importance then preserving and improving the condition of current living
        |humans////Can you say why you feel this way? Having everyone who is currently handling robotics suddenly switch to stud
        |ing biology and whatnot would be nearly impossible, so we end up doing both things at once.

    |Are you telling me I've been eating all these embryos for no reason?


    |[deleted]


        |Adult stem cells are use for repair and growth. That's been well known for quite a while now. The primary difference be
        |ween adult and embryonic stem cells is that adult stem sells lack the degree of pluripotency (the ability to turn into 
        |ny other kind of cell) that embryonic stem cells naturally have.


            |It seems to me that the findings outlined in this article indicate that adult stem cells have a little more pluripo
            |ency than we were givein them credit for, right? An injury stimuli results in adult stem cells to... (forgive me he
            |e, not a scientist) turn into a different kind of cell?


                |Maybe not all kinds of adult stem cells, but some definitely appear to be more versatile than once thought.


        |Since birth?


        |All the time! It's been a while since my last class so I'll be vague, but your body produces a great deal of stem cells
        |to replace cells that die off. Things like [mesenchymal stem cells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell)
        |are produced throughout adult life to serve somewhat specialized purposes, like the stomach ones mentioned here. Resear
        |h has shown there is potential to turn these adult, specialized stem cells into more general [pluripotent stem cells](h
        |tp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell) which can then be used for something like growing a new organ
        |for someone out of their very own cells!


    |This ties into a recent study that suggested keeping the umbilical cord attached to the baby longer since it gives more tim
    | for the baby to absorb more stem cells improving health. 


        |I don't really see how it ties in at all, embryonic stem cells from the umbilical cord are entirely different from thes
        | gastric gland cells. Care to explain?


        |I've read that its roughly 3 mins that you should keep the umbilical cord attached, since its still "downloading" diffe
        |ent cells 


    |Soon u wont be donating blood. But stem cells


        |"Soon?" [It's been around](http://www.hema-quebec.qc.ca/donner/cellules-souches/registre-des-donneurs/index.en.html) fo
        | quite some time now.


    |And yet the damn thing still can't handle an evening's worth of Mexican beer.


    |I need all of those in my gut that I can get


    |Or to repair the damage after eating a Chipotle Burrito...


        |Or buckyballs...


    |So the more food we eat, the more stem cells we produce? SEE WORLD, AMERICA IS JUST FULL OF SCIENTIST HEROES!


    |In 20 years we'll discover we're 100% stem cells. 


        |Lol oh that explains everything xD


    |Stem cells are great and all but we haven't figured out a way to actually use them safely I.e. People suffering from horrib
    |e seizures after about a week.

    |Seems like the main discoveries of the past few decades is that the guts are a bit more ~~miraculous~~ remarkable and activ
    | than we thought.////Better?


    |Starting to seem like you cant even shake a stick without hitting something that produces stem cells.


    |very interesting!


    |why dont they just use plants for stem cell


        |plants and animals have very, very, different cell structures.


    |But no, scream the progressive scientists, this means we can't experiment on unborn humans anymore!!!


        |Does it hurt to be that stupid?
