u/not_always_sane describes getting pulled over while on his motorcycle with a dog on board(/r/best of reddit)




    |I'm sorry but this is not bestof worthy. The comment is not that good, especially for r/motorcycles. And for some reason u/
    |ot_always_sane doesn't like to use subjects. 


        |Could someone explain to me that every bestof I've read a) is voted to the front page and b) has some variation of "thi
        | isn't bestof material" as the most upvoted comment.


            |I try not to be a dick, if I find myself wasting time in a subreddit that I don't like anymore, hitting the unsubsc
            |ibe button is enough for me. ////The main reason that made me complain about this post was that from the title I wa
            | expecting some epic story about whatever. This was not an epic story, was not good or even entertaining. Was short
            |and disappointing. ////I don't think r/bestof is lowering the level. I think the subreddit is seeing an increase in
            |subscribers. There are now a lot more submissions than 2 years ago. Reddit is also way more popular now than when I
            |first came here, so now we have to filter a lot of low effort content. 


                |With more subs has come the trend of "If it's more than 6 lines long, post it to BestOf". 


                |Yea... And like in every democracy there is stuff that *you* dont like but alot if people enjoy.////Instead if 
                |hining over it just press that downvote and trust that your vote has been heard.////What belongs or not in best
                |f isnt for you to decide.////The majority wants it. Then it does belong here.


            |every bestof you've read a) is voted to the front page and b) has some variation of "this isn't bestof material" as
            |the most upvoted comment.////I think you did a pretty good job explaining it yourself, but since you asked...////


            |Well you see there are 2 schools of thought. Let me start with the former. If a comment is posted purely in an info
            |mational manner, that is to say to procure in an individual, or individuals (straight or gay) some increase in base
            |knowledge, than that comment has served its purpose. On the other hand, when a comment ordains itself with humour i
            | an attempt to win over popularity with the masses at the expense of integrity, then one might question who or what
            | also why and how, such a comment came into existence. Because in the end, isn't that why we are all here? Hope it 
            |elped.


        |And yet, it made it to the front page.


            |Slow day today


                |We need some gov shit to rage at.

                    | have. You won't notice shit unless you love NASA or national parks. gib gold pls.


        |Agreed. I'm gonna forget that comment in like ten minutes. Probably an indicator that it really isn't some amazing subm
        |ssion, merely a funny story. This is the kind of comment you see in AskReddit threads all the time - why is this one so
        |noteworthy?


        |Made it sound kinda telegraphic. Bit like Hemmingway.////Sounds kinda neat.


        |Lol what is the bar set at for r/motorcycles? I've been subbed there for a while and I feel as though this is the shit 
        |e live for...//


            |I've also been subbed for a while. And sure, a big percentage of the submissions are pics of ninja bikes, or rants 
            |bout cagers but in the comments I've always encountered good advice and discussion. The sidebar is also great.

            |Yes, it is my opinion. I have opinions of my own, and sometimes I share them with others. 


    |Love the comments in here about how this is a shitty submission. ////I thought it was funny, provided picture proof, and I 
    |ould have never seen it as I don't visit /r/motorcycles...it also meets all 8 rules required by /r/bestof...////So what's t
    |e deal? ////It's also funny that the majority of users here commenting about "this is what /r/bestof has become?" have been
    |members for like 5 months and 8 months. As if they know what this placed used to be. People have been arguing about bestof 
    |ince I first got here and probably way before that. ////If people upvote it, it's what they want and thus it is best of. //
    |/I upvoted this thread, to me, it's best of. 


        |The problem people have with the recent submissions to /r/bestof is that it's becoming more of an r/pretty_okay_comment
        |. Bestof used to be just that, the best comments from various subreddits. They would be interesting, thought-provoking,
        |extremely well-written, etc. It seems like we're getting a lot less of that and a lot more submissions like this one, w
        |ich is, you know, pretty okay, kinda funny, sure it's a good comment, but it's not up to snuff when you compare it to t
        |e quality content that used to be posted here. That's not to say there wasn't stupid stuff in the past too. There was. 
        |t just didn't dominate the front page, and was usually downvoted fairly quickly.////&gt; If people upvote it, it's what
        |they want and thus it is best of.////That doesn't really follow. People can upvote anything, that doesn't make it fit t
        |e motif of the subreddit. You mentioned that this post fits the explicit criteria of the subreddit, which is true, but 
        |o does literally any comment from a non-default subreddit. That doesn't mean it *should* be representative of /r/bestof
        | just that it won't get deleted. Obviously lots of people voted for this post, and I'm not even arguing that it should 
        |e removed or should be downvoted, but it's certainly far from the bestof quality of even 6 months ago. And that's what 
        |eople resent. This place, where we used to go for really interesting content, no longer provides us with that, and ther
        |'s not really anywhere to go to get that back.

        |I agree entirely.////Everyone seems to expect /r/bestof posts to be something that vaguely disproves something another 
        |edditor said. Guess what? There's a subreddit for that: /r/yougottold.////There's no rule that comments must explain so
        |ething complicated to be worthy of r/bestof. This particular submission had a funny story that included pictures. It's 
        |retty much better than any comment made in the entirety of r/funny and r/aww, yet people are complaining that this subm
        |ssion showed up on their front page.////I unsubscribed from /r/motorcycles a long time ago because it was mostly people
        |posting pictures of their bikes. In my opinion, this r/bestof submission contains some of the most enjoyable content I'
        |e seen come out of r/motorcycles.

        |Its a cool story but you see that kind if stuff in most askreddit threads anyway. 


        |It's just a comment. And it's poorly written about a stupid story. I want to see interesting posts here that provoke th
        |ught, not just a one-off comment. 


        |Happened with /r/depthhub.////That place is not what it used to be.


    |This got to my front page. Reddit should consider removing bestof from its defaults if it can't be managed any better than 
    |his.


        |That's the problem with `reddit` and cutesy animal stories.  Not so much bestof itself.

    |Looks just like my Heidi who turns 17 his month!


    |fuck that guy for risking his dog's life, and fuck you OP for this shitty submission.


        |Why are you so angry?


            |I cant disapprove of something without being angry?


                |I don't know, can you?


                |&gt; I cant disapprove of something without being angry?////Evidently.

    |Are you retarded, OP? How is this best-of-worthy? 


    |This post didn't even suck my dick, definitely not bestof material. 


    |So this is what /r/bestof has become ... I shake my head in disgust at you all!


        |Shaking your head at the internet, is it working?  I recommend shaking a stick.


            |Well of course if I typed it then I must of literally been doing it, what with figurative expressions not existing 
            |n the internet. 


    |Wow the dog did something cute. Cop must be raging.


    |Down with this sort of thing. ////Careful now.

        |What. 


            |Just something dumb he posts in a million different submissions. Check his history.


                |Still better than most bestof submissions.
