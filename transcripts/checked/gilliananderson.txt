            |doesn't look the second movie. looks like the earlier seasons to me.


        |Honey badgers!


    |Hello David and Gillian, thank you for doing an AMA!////I think The X-Files is one of the most influental shows ever, and h
    |s really paved the way for a lot of great shows after it.////My question is, was there ever a plot line that came out of th
    | writers room that made you stop and say "Seriously?"


        |Some of the one-offs.  Like the killer cats episodes.  Todos los Bichos.  They were domesticated killer cats.  


            |So there's a scene where Scully is attacked by a killer cat.  So they had made up a cat on a stick that had moveabl
            | arms and legs, but I'm allergic to cats, so they made it out of rabbit fur instead.  The fur kept coming off and s
            |icking to my lipstick, and I was peeing my pants laughing.  So we were either cutting because I couldn't keep a str
            |ight face, or we had to keep re-applying my lipstick because the fur kept sticking to my face.  


                |It was Kim Meadows, because Kim came up to us, we were being bratty and poor Kim came up to us and he had pages
                |and pages of notes from the writer because there was a scene where the guy comes in and tell us the dog was kil
                |ed (It was killed by a cat, but we didn't know that yet) and we were supposed to have some kind of emotional re
                |ction to a dog dying that we didn't know.  Kim came over and it said something like "The agents should react ap
                |ropriately to Fluffy's death, Fluffy was a beloved dog" and we had never met fluffy, we hadn't even met the guy
                |who owned Fluffy, and we were supposed to weep. 


                    |[Clip from the gag reel of the Fluffy scene, followed by David fighting an animatronic cat George of the Ju
                    |gle style about a minute later.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=vcxYtZ0eT4E#
                    |=414)


                        |I dont care what you say, the clip at the 9 min mark is comedy gold. I died.


                            |RIP Seringol


                        |Wow, I did not expect to see Mulder asphyxiating &amp; sodomizing Supervisor Skinner.


                        |WHAT THE FUCK


                        |The part where the editors dubbed over Chris Carter was fantastic.


                    |Fluffy must have been one hell of a dog.


                    |That definitely made me LOL.


                |Or changing your pants because you kept peeing.


                |I hope that was Gillian's response, and not David's...


                |LOL!


    |Don't you guys think Queequeg deserved better?


        |Yes.


            |No. That dog killed people with its farts and it deserved to die a nasty death in the mouth of that alligator or wh
            |tever it was. Ugh.  I had to shampoo it, or walk away every few seconds, because these puffs of nastiness kept happ
            |ning.


                |"Puffs of Nastiness" should be your band name.


                    |This is downright epic.


                        |Nice band name


                    |go to r/bandnames, make this a submission!


                |I never thought Gillian Anderson would make me pee just a little.


                |this is quite possibly the best thing i've ever read on reddit hahahaha


                |this is the funniest thing I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It explains your face in our photo with "qu

                |Dog farts are so damn horrible! My friend has a dog that farts around so half the time I'm at his place and the
                |dog is around I have to hold my breath.


                |LOL!

                    |Wow, this is weird.  I was just about to correct you, but then I realized that Bryan Cranston was in both t
                    |e Drive episode of X-Files but he was also in the movie *Drive*


                    |He is quite responsible. He knew that Cranston could do a serious role whereas the studio (I think? Maybe o
                    |her producers?) doubted it after seeing him in Malcolm and Seinfeld.


                    |It's the ep that Gilligan realized Cranston's full potential; that's the role that lead to Heisenberg :)


                        |Yeah.  I knew this, but I somehow hadn't connected it with the fact that he wrote the episode.


                    |That episode of the x-files is pretty much the entire reason Bryan Cranston was asked to be WW in Breaking

                |Holy shit, I didn't know he wrote Bad Blood! That's my favorite episode!


                |Soft Light and Drive were really, really good episodes.

            |Hello David: Have you seen Gillian on the video Extremis? She's pretty hot there. Why do you think that so many men
            |and even women find Gillian so hot and attractive? What do you like the most about Gillian physically and of her pe

                    |sorry xD I confused the post here ... not my intention, I'm wrong post in your account.


        |Yeah, Vince Gilligan!!  Science!!


        |TIL


    |You're even hotter now than when the X Files was on. Is it some secret alien power you've got?


        |Yes.  Gillian is every bit as hot, and hotter.  It's somewhat shocking. 


            |Get off David's account, Gillian.


            |We're looking at you, too; only Keanu Reeves matches your seeming immortality. What's your secret, pilates?


                |Good tequila and The Who. Keeps you young forever.


                |And Nicholas Cage.


            |Obviously, there is some sort of supernatural influence making you guys get hotter as you age. I think you have the
            |plot of XF3. Get on that.////(Seriously, thanks for both of you being a formative part of my teenage years, and the

            |How hot is Karen in real life? She makes my pants tighter. 


        |David, will you marry me already? 


        |It's just what the 90's did to people. 


    |Hey David, after that documentary you were in about male models, did your hand modeling career ever take off again?


        |Uh yeah, I'm a hand model Mom, a finger jockey.  Until the day I die. 


            |David, whenever my 2- and 4-year-old daughters ask us the same question repeatedly (which is A LOT) my wife or I us
            |ally answer with "Are you kidding? I just told you, like, a minute ago." Thanks for that.


                |My understanding is that was more or less ad-libbed, because Stiller had forgotten his next line and just repea
                |ed himself instead.


                |I read that the line wasn't in the script. Stiller forgot his line and just repeated the question so Duchovny i
                |provised and went with it. Makes it that much cooler.

            |"You freaking idiot!" Is probably the best line in that movie.


            |He's not like those faceandbody boys. 


            |I love you.


            |Yes, but why *male models???*

        |my favorite would be Flukeman because Darinn Morgan was in the suit, one of our great writers.  And I had never met him
        | and I never did meet him, because he was in the suit and it took so much time in makeup. So when we did that show, I n
        |ver actually saw Darin's face.  A couple of months later I was on a flight from Vancouver to LA and a guy sat next to m
        | and started asking me a bunch of inane questions.  I thought "Oh my god, I have 3 hours to sit next to this guy."  And
        |I was despairing.  ANd then he handed me a book and said "will you sign it to my nemesis?" and I said "what do you mean
        | and he said "I'm Darin Morgan, I'm Flukeman." 


            |My favorite Monster of the week used to be, well I would normally answer that it would be Tooms.  But on the first 
            |pisode that we shot, Tooms 1, It was my birthday when we were shooting it.  I turned 25. And Doug offered me a birt

            |take him up on it.

                |I watched when I was around 10. The one that scared the shit out of me was where the guy could slip through the

                |ck. Good times! I recommend showing your kids this episode on halloween in a few years!


                    |Haha Tooms - that dude was perfectly cast as a next-level creeper.


                    |I didn't like the idea when I first read about it, FBI meets Kolchack was what it looked like. Then, I got

                |ently used Scully as an example of a female role model because of her intelligence, and looking back I can trul
                | see what an impact her character had on me.  Thank you!!


                |First episode I watched: War of the Coprophages, when I was 5, scared the shit out of me. Came back at age 7 an
                | fell in love, so I'm sure they can handle it.


                |When the show started, I was about 9. I was relentlessly scared shitless, but it was OK, since both my parents 
                |lso watched it. I never admitted to it, of course, but it wasn't a coincidence that I sat in the middle every t
                |me the show was on.////So, yeah, I would say around that age is brilliant. Precisely scary enough to be really 
                |cary, but not enough to get too many nightmares.


            |Thanks for responding! Do you actually have the pinball machine?


            |The first X-files episode I ever watched was Excelsis Dei, the one with the old people's home and mushrooms, and it
            |left me traumatized for weeks!


                |that one is pretty darn creepy!


            |Is the pinball machine in your house?

            |"Home" absolutely terrified me when I was a kid. I had to sleep in my parents room for 2 nights after I saw it.

        |I would masturbate in a red speedo.


            |I don't know? I'd put on a nice dress and some tasteful heels and take it from there.

    |David, what are your plans after Californication? I personally adore this show (shhh I watch it for the plot) and am sad to
    |know the next season's the last!


        |I've got a movie that I want to direct and just looking at stuff, nothing planned at the moment.

                    |Yep it's called I Want To Believe, it's more of a long stand alone episode. 


                        |Yeah.  Didn't really get that great of ratings.  I honestly think that if it had been on FOX or AMC or 
                        |ome other cable network, it would have been received better.  It's like...an okay episode.  It's not st

                |Yeah and make it about aliens again. What the fuck was that last one.Jesus.


                    |Did you even watch the show? 80% had nothing to do with aliens... It's not out of the ordinary.

                |great underrated movie.


            |David, ff you got Gillian a guest role on the last season of Californiacation that would be **EPIC**!  Love Califor

            |*What movie?* Can you tell us anything more!?!


            |Evolution 2? Please say Evolution 2! 


            |Going to piggyback on this to say: Californication is amazing and if it weren't for you I probably wouldn't have gi
            |en it a chance. It started as something fun and relaxing to watch, but became much more.////I've been a big fan sin
            |e The X-Files, partly because Mulder was a character I could relate to. Your character in Californication is pretty
            |much the opposite of that, but I'm fascinated by his ways.////Thank you for bringing these two very different chara
            |ters to life!


            |** David, How many songs have you written so far? are you going to release them? **


            |Is the movie you want to direct something that you have written? //I think it would be great if you directed XFiles

            |What can you tell us about the movie?


            |I absolutely love Californication and I had no idea it was ending. This ruins my day.////It better not end with Han

            |So... that's a thing. Back in 20...


            |of course it exists!


                |Is it a thing? Then a subreddit exists for.


        |I tried watching it for the plot (season 1), but everytime my wife walked in to the room it appeared to her I was watch
        |ng porn. "But it's about his family relationships, writing, the industry, and it's hilarious!" I appealed to her. "OK" 
        |he said, then the next time she walked in a nun was blowing Hank. I sighed and turned it off.////^(but I kept watching 
        |ecretly sssh)


            |Lmao I think by the end of season 1 I was totally invested in the characters' lives. Just couldn't stop watching. B
            |t def no complaints about the gratuitous DD butt and VPL...


        |I had not heard it was the last. But I am kind of glad. As a fan of the show, I am glad they're not going to keep it mo
        |ing until it gets cancelled.


        |It's a sequel to Evolution, right?////*Right?*


    |Who amongst the both of you, should I have with me to have a better chance of surviving a zombie/alien apocalypse?


        |David, definitely.  No, you would.  I just saw World War Z.  You'd win, I'd die in a second.


            |You'd have to take off your heels to run.  Can your little legs reach the pedals?

    |David and Gillian, despite the various DVD collections FOX has put out over the years, you guys have never done a commentar
    | for an episode together. I realize this is probably because you live on separate continents, and maybe FOX hasn't brought 
    |t up. But would you be willing to do some together? Maybe if FOX puts the series out on Blu-Ray in the future? We would lov
    | it -- and it doesn't even matter if you don't remember anything about the episodes you watch. It might even make it better
    | :D


        |This is conspicuously unanswered.  On the thinnest of evidence I'm going to call x-files bluray megapack with super spe

            |they live on different continents?


    |What were your reactions to Bree Sharps' "David Duchovny" song and how did the filming of the music video come about? 


        |It was all Gillian's idea.  I thought it was really funny.  A friend of mine, Joe Blake who's a casting director, was d
        |ing a faux country doc called "Dill Scallion."////It was early in the faux docs business.  He had a lot of country musi
        | and he came across this song and sent it to me. And I was like "Wow! I have my own song!" and I would play it in the c
        |r because I thought it was a good song, I was pleased, I thought the tune was really good.  And then I memorized it bec
        |use I listened to it a number of times.////And then I got caught singing along to it with the window down in the car.  
        |f course they didn't know the song.////I just sped up. 


            |And then these 2 writer's assistants made the video.  It was meant to be a Christmas present to me, a private thing
            |  I guess they must have leaked it?  You'd think I'd have leaked it from my previous story, but I don't know how it
            |got out there.  I was not aware that that was what they were doing.  It was a surprise gift, which was nice. 


                |This reminds me of that Simpsons episode where you just keep talking. 


                    |"it's like a lava lamp."


                    |Untold mysteries of... untold mysteries.


                |It was sent around the world as a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy on VHS. I had a very poor quality version

            |I got that mental image of an extremely famous person singing along to a song about themselves. That is gold. Thank
            |, David. 


            |I'm so happy in my little heart right now imagining this. You have no idea. :')


        |He has a copy of me singing this on a DVD for UNICEF charity - poor man! LOL!


        |Lined above, but [here](http://youtu.be/Wijp4-3giNw) it is again.


    |David, did you keep the red speedo from The X-Files ;) #ddd


        |That was MY red speedo.  It's in the Smithsonian.  Really.


            |The Smithsonian actually hasn't put the X-Files stuff on display. Fans always ask them about it, but it's all in st
            |rage. :-(


                |I heard this asshole keeps smoking inside and screws with the box where all the X Files stuff is kept. 


                    |HA! I get it. Nice


                    |I think I dated that asshole... 


                    |Thanks for the gold! 


                |Is it in that huge warehouse with all the crates from Raiders of the Last Ark? 


                    |I'm afraid I can't comment on that, but I can confirm we have top men looking after it.


                        |Who?////


                            |Top.  Men. 


                |They all take turns sniffing the speedo and wearing it as a facemask. They're strange birds at the Smithsonian.


                |Sounds like a conspiracy to me!


                |Finally the real reason for the government shutdown. To keep the Smithsonian closed so they can't reveal all th
                |se secrets...


            |RIGHT. Can you get it back so we can have a reprise of your ~performance~?


            |as it should be!


            |How did I not know that you're so cod damn hysterical?! All of your comments are making me guffaw. You guys are awe
            |ome, thanks for this AMA!


            |Wish I could confirm, but the Smithsonian is closed.


            |Side story: I was so into X-Files (and you, *blush*) when I was a teenager that my brother and sister-in-law bought
            |red speedos, "signed" your name onto them, and gave them to me for Christmas. They told me that they got it from so
            |e Hollywood auction.////For *two years* I was gullible enough to think I had "your" speedos from that episode. *bur
            |es face into hands in shame*


            |It's true - I've seen it.  Sadly however, the red speedo is being furloughed ... so until the #shutdown is over... 


            |I would like to wear that speedo on my face.


        |#ddd is not red; try #f00.


    |Gillian, you voiced a wolf in one of my favorite movies, Princess Mononoke. Can you talk about how that was? I really enjoy
    |Miyazaki films, so just curious.////PS David, I love the way you say "muthafucka" in Californication.


        |I love Miyazaki films too! The original voice in the original Japanese version of the film was played by a famous Japan
        |se transvestite, so as you can imagine they had a very deep voice.  I tried to emulate that voice, miserably.  So I alw
        |ys feel like I failed.


            |Have you ever noticed that our voices were higher in the beginning of the show?  As we relaxed, our voices relaxed.
            | Also, I went through puberty. 


                |I think only dogs could hear the frequency at which your first lines were said.//(I kid I kid, the fandom refer
                | to you both in season one as "infants" xxoxox)


                |Then second puberty.


                |Didn't everyone who watched this show go through puberty? I was 13 when the show started.... Now that I look ba
                |k, that show was like my puberty in a sense......( Jesus that sounds so creepy when I say that!)  


                |What how young were you? 


                |stop being cute, I'm a straight male


                |By your responses here, you hit pause at 16 and haven't resumed since. ////Y'all put on the best Q&amp;A I've s
                |en on Reddit. ////(ok, well, tied with Snoop) 


                |right you are madafakaaaaaaa


            |You didn't fail. Your voice stands out in the film. 


            |Nonsense! Your voice is amazing as goddess the wolves! It's hauntingly savage.


            |Nah, you were great in Mononoke. The problem is that those Japanese voice actors are the masters of voice acting. T
            |at is literally all they do and they are very good at it.


            |I LOVE all the Studio Ghibli films and that is the only one I haven't seen! I'm more of a Totoro, Ponyo and Kiki's 
            |elivery Service kind of girl. I will definately be watching it tomorrow though! 


            |No!  That was my favorite movie for years, and your voice was absolutely perfect for Moro!


            |I didn't know you were the voice for the wolf, but it was really great! Overall the voiceover for princess mononoke
            |was very good, which usually isn't the case with Japanese to English voiceovers for anime. ////Usually I watch japa
            |ese audio with english subs, but I've never done it with princess mononoke cause it was so good!


            |No way! In my book, you're tied with Minnie Driver for best voice work in the movie! 


        |!!!!!!! I HAD NO IDEA!!!!!!!!//


        |Damn.. That first thing was news to me, and I've seen that one recently.


    |Hi Gillian and David!////Quick and dirty question: who was the guest star on the X-Files who most blew you away with their 
    |erformance and made you say "wow."?


        |Brad Dourif as Luther Lee Boggs.


            |I just watched that episode this week. I love how Brad Dourif just randomly pops up in these kinds of roles and ste
            |ls the show.


                |He was on some episodes of *Star Trek: Voyager* as a murderous Betazoid.  I know, it doesn't make sense, but th
                |y wrote his character so that he had no telepathic abilities.  He starts out as a cold killer but ends up using
                |his, erm, *talents* to die a hero.  ////Watching Dourif and Tim Russ act together was a bright spot in an other
                |ise dreadful season.


                |Dourif is crazy in everything he does, really good in The Green Mile


                    |No. He wasn't in Green Mile. Are you confusing him with Doug Hutchison and Luther Lee Boggs with Tooms? ///
                    |And I've never even watched X-Files. 


                        |Oh shit, you're right. My apologies. I Don't know why I get that guy confused with other actors. ////My
                        |other frequent confusion is with [Lance Heinrekson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000448/) and [Stehen Mc
                        |attie](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0570385/?ref_=nv_sr_1)


                            |Maybe it's because those two are the creepiest mugs in film. 


                                |Yeah, but they're in all my favorite sci-fi movies :)


                    |He wasn't in The Green Mile. 


                    |And Wormtongue in LOTR. He totally nails it.


                    |&gt; Dourif is crazy in everything he does////While certainly typecast most of the time as an intelligent b
                    |t unhinged bad guy...he does have other parts.////He plays the doctor in Deadwood for instance.//


                        |Where he played an intelligent but unhinged good guy.


                        |Or Dune, where he played the intelligent but unhinged bad guy.


            |http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM-Qmxkc2JQ


            |Every Brad Dourif performance blows me away....


            |He was one of my favorites from Deadwood. That guy can act.


            |Dear God yes.  *Beyond the Sea* is easily my favorite.  Well, maybe second, after *José Chung's From Outer Space*. 
            |Love that Dourif is able to convey Don Davis while looking or sounding nothing like Don Davis.  *Acting*.


            |Truth - he was superb. 


            |That is such an awesome choice; Brad Dourif is an amazing character actor.


            |&gt; Brad Dourif////Holy shit, wormtongue


            |He was really a cut above an extremely long list of inspired guest performances. Whoever casted for X Files deserve
            | one billion dollars.


            |Brad Dourif is an easy "wow" answer in a lot of his roles. 


            |That man does creepy well. 


        |Steve Railsback from Duane Barry.


            |I don't know why, but I remember him from that Ed Gein movie. 


            |I went to HS with his niece!


        |And have you enjoyed him in Breaking Bad?


        |i think you both meant to say kathy griffin as lulu and betty


        |    wow//                 so guest star//           many performens                   wow//

        |such act//             wow


    |Are you believers? (In UFOs, aliens, etc)


        |It wouldn't surprise me.   It's just the fact of it.  The Universe is bigger than big.


            |Odds are we are not alone. ////There used to be in the Middle Ages, you've heard the phrase "the ship of fools" whe

                |I think the visual I am getting from Dentists and Proctologists in the same sentence is too nauseating for this
                |hour!


                |I think it's an excellent theory. It would explain so much. Why was this never explored on X-Files?


                |I think with the right pitch, this could get studio support.


                    |Better to do it as an indy film. Hollywood would just use it as a vehicle for Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller.


                        |In this case, that seems appropriate.


                |Scully would have something to say. And it would likely be very scientific and condescending. Followed by "Muld
                |r, you're nuts!"


                    |And, of course, Mulder would end up being absolutely correct.


                |You're both right.


                |What a strange race where proctologists and dentists are B-arkers. I'm sure Douglas Adams would have approved.


                |*squee* He said it.

        |s and 2 things happened.  One was that I wore pantyhose and a dress outfit and I really felt for women because I was no
        | fat but I felt fat as soon as I put the women's clothes on because they were tight in really strange places.  And the 
        |ther one was that when I would get off work and go swim at the Sports Connection in West Hollywood and I would shower a
        |terwards, and it looked like I was wearing fur shorts, because I only naired up to mid-thigh.   So no, I didn't get pic

        |Seriously, I've wanted to bang him since I was 12 years old. 


        |confirmed


            |Agreed


    |hey david and gillian, what was the most embarrassing moment each of you had on set? xxxxx 


        |Well I think I told this story at Comic-Con but we were shooting an episode in LA, we were shooting Arcadia, and so the
        | were flushing all of their garbage psychic and otherwise, and there was this monster that was made out of all of that.
        | And we had a bit of a crowd watching, just because we weren't locked up in a McMansion, and I hadn't seen the monster,
        |and I shot my reactions of being terrified first and girding myself to battle it, and then the poor guy came out in the
        |monster suit, and Michael Watkins had the best line because I said "That's not a scary looking monster" and he said "He
        |looks like the guy who fucked Mrs. Butterworth."  Mrs. Butterworth is a maple-syrup bottle.  That was embarrassing for 
        |e to react in front of spectators at nothing as if I was terrified. 


            |I can think of plenty outside of the show.  In retrospect, embarrassing was my pastel purplish pantsuits, they were
            |'t even natural, like Lycra.  Or the fact that we materialized the cell phones out of midair because they wouldn't 
            |ave fit in our pockets.  Or where would we get the giant flashlights from?


                |WOW! never thought about that!


                |I bought one of those flashlights because of the show 


                |Im curently rewatching the shows and... in the first episodes there werent even cellphones; I think cells becam

                |so...plot driven inventory hammerspace?


    |So do you look as good in a faux leather suit as you did a decade ago?////Also, David, do you?


        |My question is: when did I wear a faux leather suit?  I don't remember wearing a faux leather suit but it sounds like a
        |good idea. Please remind me.

                |Had no idea this existed. I'll be in my bunk…


                |I had a poster of a picture from that shoot in my room as a teenager. ////That picture saw quite a lot. 


                |Aww, I already have that one! I want another in better resolution!


                |Looks like latex, not leather.

                |Haha, awesome.  I've now made this my laptop's wallpaper.


            |I have no logical reply for you. I'm officially out of the question asking race. ////Also, x-files movies. We need 
            |ore. 


            |This a valid question. Even in the drunkest of stupors I think I would remember wearing a faux leather suit.


            |I remember you wore a speedo in an episode and I gotta say, it kick-started my puberty. 


            |I'm not sure, please provide the after shots while we find the other pictures.

                |That was rubber, not leather! No wonder we were confused.  I had to put baby powder all over my body to get it

        |Leather?  Have I been living a lie all these years, by thinking this was a tight rubber suit?


            |Previous comment from Gillian confirms rubber.


    |Thanks for being the woman who showed me that science wasn't just for boys.////In fact, I think one of the greatest gifts o
    | the X-Files is that the lead male character is irrational and nonsensical.  It has been done since, especially in the genr
    |, but it was the first show I saw that challenged those roles.////So, no questions, just plain old thanks from a long time 
    |an and (now) woman of science.//////PS: Thanks for having Alvin Law on the show.  He's from my hometown and a huge inspirat
    |on//PPS: Thanks for Califonication, Mr. Duchovny.  I love that show.


        |There's a lot of women who have come to me and told me they have gone into some form of science because of Scully, whic
        | I think is really cool.  Thank you. 


            |I'm only slightly embarrassed to admit that my best friend and I used to wear pant suits and carry homemade FBI bad
            |es to school to be like Scully...we were 12. She's now a doctor and I have a PhD in neuroscience ultimately because
            |Scully inspired us to be scientists.


            |I'm one of those girls. Thank *you*.


            |yep. My sister finally became inspired and motivated and happy in high school when Scully came on the screen. She a
            |pired to to go into pathology immediately, and now is doing great work in cancer research. That role influenced her
            |entire course of life. Being a science-gal suddenly became supercool, a huge confidence boost for schoolkids who go
            | bullied.////Thanks for making Scully so amazing, Gillian! It really touched teenage girls.////edit: words


                |Must. Not. Ruin. Beautiful. Words. With. Dirty. Mind!!!


                    |oh dear, how did I miss that one... 


                        |because you're an unforgivable sinner.


                    |But those beautiful words are... so touching.


                |how do i reach these keeeeeds... apparently with a tough ass kicking female co-lead in an alien drama


                |Boy, thank god Gillian didn't end up playing a hooker.////I never knew she was such a labor market trend setter


            |I'm another one of those girls. :) 


            |Your last AMA was one of my favorites. You're so sweet, and you talked in support of your sister's "illegal marriag
            |." You fit right in here on reddit.


            |Not even kidding in the slightest. Scully was absolutely a female in science role model for me early on. Heading to
            |med school next year. Many, many thanks!


            |I work at "a big tech company" (I am a guy, it's a male dominated industry) and your name comes up *frequently* whe
            | I am interviewing women graduating from the sciences. Your portrayal of Dana Scully was inspirational to a great n
            |mber of people.


            |Thank you for your reply.  It means a lot to me.  


            |Scully also made being a smart woman cool. And normal. =) 


        |Castle is also like that. ////Richard Castle is a manchild with crazy ideas and his partner, Kate Beckett, is clinical,
        |cold, and a badass.


            |Many examples of it exist since, and probably before.  Firefly, Bones, Voyager...all have similar characters.  Scul
            |y was my first :)


        |The lead male character may have seemed irrational and nonsensical, but he was not in any way. Mulder was the only one 
        |ith his head on straight.


            |That's true, but he didn't always know how to get his point across to non-believers.


                |Yes...well, try having something so clear and obvious to you be dismissed by those around you because you are "
                |motional" and "irrational".  Men are passionate, women are irrational.////Mulder did not have his head on strai
                |ht.  He was nuts.  If he were sane, he would have learned to speak in 3 word euphemisms and mastered corporate 
                |peak so he wouldn't have to struggle so much in the FBI as a rogue.  I can thank X-Files for teaching me that, 
                |oo.  :)


                    |The interplay between the two characters was invaluable to its success. Mulder was a rebellious, brash and 
                    | brilliant investigator who was the only one to see through the layers of conspiracy. Scully was a conformi
                    |g, honest and equally brilliant scientist who provided a yin to his yang, forcing scientific accountability
                    |to his discoveries. Mulder was the impetus, Scully was the legitimacy. ////Another brilliant move was makin
                    | Mulder a religious skeptic while Scully was the believing Catholic. That was a brave move that ended up gi
                    |ing each character balance and depth.


            |It really did start to bug me after awhile. After all the crazy shit that they saw together, and how many paranorma
            | things Mulder was right about, Scully would still roll her eyes at him and say "Mulder, I'm sure there's a reasona
            |le explanation for this?"


                |On the other hand, just because one unlikely thing exists, that doesn't prove another unlikely thing also exist
                |. If aliens visited us tomorrow, would that make the existence of the tooth fairy more likely?


        |wish I could upvote this a thousand times.


        |Uhhh way to miss the entire philosophy of the show. Mulder is in no way "irrational and nonsensical." His theories were
        |always right, Scully was just more pragmatic with her approach. I guess some people just see what they want to see.


            |Uh...ya....only "some" people see what they want to see....//In the real world, the way Mulder behaves, his theorie
            |, his frantic efforts to shake truth into others....it doesn't matter that he is right.  He would be considered ins
            |ne, irrational.//We know he is right because we are watching his experiences, not because of the "philosophy of the
            |show".


        |This is true, but the funny part of the show was that Mulder was virtually always right. Every show Scully was proved w
        |ong and within just a few seasons she had straight up witnessed paranormal activity of every stripe, and yet she'd star
        | the next ep as skeptical as ever and rolling her eyes at Mulder. 


            |That is what a science education does to you.  True story.


        |What about Cheers?


            |... the lead female roles were walking disasters.

            |I wasn't always a woman.  Like the vast majority of human females, I started as a girl and matured through many sta

        |They can come back to advertise XF3 ANYTIME.


        |Honestly, in the vast majority of celebrity AMAs where they advertise something, it's done extremely tactfully. Like, j

        |underrated reply


        |Their goes that theory. Secretly promoting Bravo network I see...


        |Asa Akira did one yesterday and the only thing she was advertising was her butthole.


            |True.  However that is most assuredly a product that is for sale.


                |"I sell buttholes and butthole accessories."


            |Yes, she was selling her proxy butthole. Some kind of sleeve for a torch device IIRC.


        |They're "advertising" their conference at the Paley center. 


            |Also, keeping fans happy isn't just something that's fun to do. It's good for future employability!


        |That's because an admin from Reddit was with them helping them post (and encouraging them to do it).

            |I'm gonna go out back and do a... parameter check.


            |Yeah so underrated, who could forget that  hour and a half (possibly) long commercial for Head and Shoulders


                |Funnily enough, they had to buy all of it themselves. Head and Shoulders hated the idea and refused to support 
                |hem in it. The movie guys said fuck it and did it anyway. The "commercial" at the end was like the last thing t

        |I actually enjoyed that movie and forgot about it.

        |Not unless you want a solid gold dancer on your hands...


        |Back when I still owned DVD's, this was one of the 5 or 6 movies I owned. Just so I could always show it to people that
        |had never heard of it. 


        |You forgot Julianne Moore!////We watched this for a class I had in school comparing science fiction movies to real scie

        |I saw this movie. Just wanted to let David know it was pretty mainstream when it came out. Nowadays, it may be more obs

        |I can not upvote this enough.


            |You could create more Reddit accounts? :p


        |One of my favorite movies!


        |One of my favorite movie of all time. I loved the way Orlando and David played off each other. David with his drier sin

        |OK!


            |Concise and ambiguous. I love it!

            |That's what I thought!////There's a show, young Hannibal with Gillian Anderson in it.//////Well I don't think she's
            |inside of him yet.


    |Hi Gillian and David. This question is for Gillian - Thank you for being such a strong woman for us ladies everywhere on an
    | off the screen. What's it like to be held to such an honor from when you were so young and essentially right off the bat? 
    |ould you prefer it the way it is a different way? Thank you again!   //***XF3!!!***


        |Well first of all, thank you very much.  That is not something I think about on a regular basis, but I think that the f
        |ct that there are people who aspire to be strong women, with integrity around the world, inspires me. 


            |Started watching X-Files at age 11, and I always looked up to Scully as a strong female role model.


            |There are very few strong and realistic portrayals of women in sci-fi. I would say Scully and Buffy are in a small 
            |nd select class of 'real women' on tv.


            |My coworker idolizes you as a strong female role model. She just quit her job to be a cop. Also, her email password
            |is "scully92". 


            |They're doing it for the children.


            |Hi Gillian, is it true your Myers-Briggs personality type is ENTP? ([Source](http://www.celebritytypes.com/entp.php
            |Anderson))


            |:-)


            |[deleted]


                |Pro-tip: don't be that guy.  I am pretty sure Gillian Anderson doesn't want to think about your preteen weenie,
                |and I doubt you'd have had the audacity to say something about it to her in real life.  It's not funny, it's ru
                |e.


        |OZZIE!! She answered you!!!!!! I'm so happy for you and can only imagine your reaction, congrats!!


            |Thank you! I still cant believe it.. someone pinch me! 


    |David - your references to vegetarian Tofurky eatin' zombies in Hollywood AD and Scully's non-fat Tofutti Rice Dreamsicle i
    | The Unnatural are some of my favorite. Are you vegetarian/vegan? 


        |I've recently become vegetarian again, or that's my intention.  I generally eat whatever is put in front of me, so I ma
        | eat meat if it's put in front of me, but I will not seek it out, so I would classify myself as a vegetarian.////


            |In the X-files, mostly people got eaten. 


                |I have no idea why you felt the need to emphasize that, but now I'm mortified it's simply because people were l
                |ft in front of you and you ate all of them.


                |Esteban was eaten


                |Nice. Had to come back for the one-liner huh?

            |Oh wow. That's just like me. Why do you try to be a vegetarian, David? I'm very much on the same mindset as you, I 
            |elieve. I even wrote a mini essay why I try to cut out meat. https://medium.com/the-ingredients-2/11a5e4d54d12


    |What is one storyline or idea you wish would have made it into The X-Files? Could be something left on the editing room flo
    |r or just an idea you had along the way. Love you guys!


        |Yeah, you know we weren't in the writer's room so we didn't really know what ideas they were thinking about doing or no
        | doing.  So I think by the time we were done, all the parts of the buffalo were used.  


            |Thanks for answering my question! I've been a huge fan for a long time, so that just made my day!

    |This AMA is like an internet wet dream.


        |Yes, yes it is, and everyone...came? It's gotta be some kind of record.


    |Hello, Gillian and David. My question for you is:  Do either of you still keep in touch with any of the producer/writers fr
    |m X-Files - Carter, Spotnitz, Gilligan, Morgan/Wong, et al?  Any chance of working with one or more of them outside of an X
    | project?  Sorry, that was TWO questions.


        |I'm in touch with Chris and Howard Gordon I see occasionally. Maybe Bowman, he calls every now and then, he works on "C
        |stle."


            |I talk to Kim Manners sometimes in my sleep.


                |:'(


                |Wait that just broke my heart.


                |&lt;3 


            |Since you've directed Bones before, has Rob Bowman ever asked you if you'd like to direct an episode of Castle?


            |I would love to see you guys on Castle.


    |Okay, time to get serious here. No more fluffy softball questions. Be honest about what I'm about to ask you.////Captain Ki
    |k or Captain Picard?


        |Gillian says "who's Captain Picard?"////And for David, it's not even a question, because there is no Captain Picard, th
        |re is ONLY Captain Kirk.


            |Kirk, eh? And Gillian Anderson asked "who's Captain Picard". [I...see. Well. Okay.](http://i.imgur.com/ieIzg.gif)

                |I think you got down voted by David Duchovny


    |Hello! What are your top three music albums?


        |Umm, let's say.  The White Album by the Beatles.  I like Stevie Wonder's Songs In the Key Of Life.  Who's Next by the W

            |&gt;the Who////My man.//


            |TIL that David Duchovny and I have similar tastes in both music and choice of alcoholic beverages!  Cheers to good

            |Okay, she says Rumors, an all-time best, then you say Who's Next... Another of the greatest albums! Phew, D &amp; G
            |have good taste in rock and roll!


            |Holy guacamole, I've been validated!  I share music taste with Fox Mulder!


            |C'mon David, I was 100% sure you'd also bring up Exile on Main St.!


            |No love for the Stones?//


            |Hell, you both have good taste. Although we're similar ages, so maybe it's just that.


            |You're awesome.


            |You are my hero man. This just confirms it.


            |I would have guessed some Warren Zevon.


        |I still really like Jeff Buckley's Grace album.  Fleetwood Mac's Rumors.  I don't know which Radiohead album is my favo
        |ite, probably OK Computer.


            |Damn fine taste, Gillian. 


            |jeff buckley!


            |Deciding which Radiohead album is my favorite is also a struggle for me. Do you have a favorite Radiohead song?


            |&gt;probably OK Computer.////Brilliant and relevant. I knew Gillian was my first star-crush for a reason.////"I wis
            | that they'd swoop down in a country lane, late at night when I'm driving. Take me on board their beautiful ship, s
            |ow me the world as I'd love to see it."


            |Gillian,  have you seen David's Redskins video that's set to Empire of the Sun's We are the People? i remember you 
            |aying that was a fave song of yours


            |If you haven't already, watch the Jeff Buckley Live in Chicago DVD. [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0738900672


            |Wow, great taste in music, probably my same picks.  Ever listened to Sunny Day Real Estate's 'How It Feels to Be So
            |ewhat On'?  I think you would really love them.


            |You probably won't see this, but I hope Buckley's "Lover, You Should've Come Over" stands out to you...I can't begi
            | to describe how incredible that song is.


            |Wow, you're pretty hip


            |I've been on an OK Computer kick for the last two months.  I just get lost in it.  Love your taste in music!


            |one of my favorite lines ever, "just because you feel it doesn't mean it's real". So many out there don't get that.


            |I Love you :)


            |This is the correct answer. 


            |im so happy you are a fleetwood mac fan! have you been at one of their 2013 tour stops? there was even christine mc
            |ie on stage after 16 years in the O2 london concert.


            |We that that old, forgotten just came back. 


            |Rumors is the correct answer. One of the all-time best albums!


            |Also, if you love Buckley, check out the album 'Distorted Lullabies' by Ours.  Jimmy Gnecco is definitely up there 
            |ith Jeff in singing skill.


        |I know this is a superficial question but this is the one I want answered. 


    |Did you think Moulder should have bought a digital camera? 


        |That would have shortened the series. 


            |Although back then all he would have gotten were a few grainy, blurred photos before the battery died. And then nob
            |dy would be able to find the right cable because it had a stupid proprietary port.


            |Exactly! X files would be so much boring in this context!


            |It's true - if they had an iPhone the entire show would have been over. Imagine if M&amp;S got that alien ship risi
            |g out of the ice on a Vine? 


        |They didn't exist yet!////Damn kids. Get off my lawn.


            |They did. It just would've been very expensive until about season 3.


        |In 1993?


            |Prototype digital camera technology goes back to the 70's and early 80's, but the first "commercial" digital camera
            |was a Kodak.////&gt;In 1991, Kodak released the first professional digital camera system (DCS), aimed at photojourn
            |lists. It was a Nikon F-3 camera equipped by Kodak with a 1.3 megapixel sensor.


        |Mouldy Mulder?


        |It fit in the '90s but they could never make x-files today. Too many cell phone plot holes to fill.


            |Seems like the first thing writers have to do these days is come up with a reason the characters can't use their ph
            |nes. 


    |How was your experience working on one of the funniest Simpsons episodes ever?


        |Moulder: "Wait a minute Scully. What's the point of this test?"////Scully "No point... I just thought he could stand to
        |lose a little weight."////Moulder: "His jiggling is almost hypnotic."////Scully: "It's like a lava lamp."


        |i wish they answered this. :D


    |Hi there. As I live in Vancouver BC, what were your favorite things and your not so favorite things about our city?


        |Well, Gillian doesn't like the rain.  Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing about Vancouver that i don't like.  
        | LOVE Vancouver, I'm not just kissing ass, it's liveable, it's beautiful and they should love me back (finally).


            |Thanks. The rain can  get to you and considering there was a lot of rainy shoots for the x-files I am not surprised
            | I am glad you did enjoy Vancouver and we would definitely welcome you back anytime.  


            |My wife grew up in Vancouver in the 90s and was(is) a huge X-Files fan.  She was really sad when the show left Vanc
            |uver and I think there was a lot of misinformation at the time about what you thought about the city David.  I'm de
            |initely going to share your comment with her!  And on the off chance that you guys see this, the X-Files are amazin
            |!  I loved the show and we never, ever made fun of my friend who had the giant Gillian Anderson poster in his locke
            | in high school.


            |I'm from Vancouver living in New Jersey for the past few years and trying to get back home. Miss it a lot.


            |Can confirm. We love you back.


            |Van city guy: I love youuuuuuu!


            |We do love you, believe me!


            |Yeah people hated you for that move.  I used to love going to outdoor areas I recognized from the show and playing 
            | files as a kid.  Fluke worm for the win.


    |Hi Gillian and David, I'm pretty fucking excited to get this opportunity to communicate with you both! Goes without saying 
    |hat I'm a massive fan of the two of you and a lot of the work you've done, but the character portrayals of yours closest to
    |my heart will always be as Mulder and Scully. Feel free to answer as many or as few questions as you'd like!////* I'm curre
    |tly re-watching the whole series with my girlfriend (who is also a huge fan) and just recently I was curious to know if the
    |two of you have any favourite episodes of the X-Files that you remember particularly fondly?////* Considering the massive s
    |ccess of the X-Files and the hardcore fandom surrounding the show, do you ever feel as though it over-shadows your efforts 
    |n other projects and does this bother you?////* [Gillian, did you eat that cricket in the episode Humbug?](http://i.imgur.c
    |m/bKOFrov.gif)////* Is Mitch Pileggi just a giant cuddly teddy bear in real life?////* In your own opinion, did Mulder and 
    |cully have a hidden sexual relationship during the series? Actually this question isn't optional.////Thanks a lot for every
    |hing. Best of wishes to the two of you in your professional and your private lives. And if you're ever in Sweden, let me bu
    | you a drink! PS. Gillian, you (and a little Kate Winslet in Titanic) are the main reason why I'm so fond of redheads; and 
    |s not to be sexist, I've got a total man crush on you as well David!


        |Gillian loves Bad Blood.  I do like Post-Modern Prometheus, we all love Jose Chung, we love Small Potatoes, we love all
        |the funny ones, we're easy that way.  


            |And David loves everything he directed. THAT WAS A JOKE. Everything Chris directed. Triangle turned out so good.//


                |I don't feel that it overshadows my work.  I'm sure Gillian doesn't feel that way either. 


                    |Yes, Gillian really ate that cricket in Humbug.////Mitch Pileggi a giant cuddly teddybear? Mitch Pileggi...
                    |e love Mitch.  However in a couple of episodes, he tucked his sweater in his jeans.  And we'll never forgiv
                    | him for that.  Just cuz he was in really good shape and he wanted to show it.  That was in 1893.


                        |In response to your last question: well yes of course they did. 


                            |Actually, Scully had a one-night stand with Krycek.  Kidding!


                                |It's always Krycek!


                                |He was pretty damn good-looking; I can't blame her.////But if I had a choice, I'd obviously go

                            |David! I watched your show since I was a kid growing up in Chile. 


                            |Ahh! Straight from the fingers of the woman who wrote "all things." Question answered! I wonder how
                            |that episode jived with Chris Carter's desire to keep the Mulder/Scully relationship super ambiguou
                            |. 


                        |sweater in jeans is a dealbreaker


                        |That's a good point on the jeans-sweater thing.  A man's got to have principles.


                        |1893? Am I missing something?


                            |You must have missed the time travel series where the cast and crew went to 1893 to do an entire se
                            |son.  I can see how you would have missed it, since it was on [Nickelodeon](https://en.wikipedia.or
                            |/wiki/Nickelodeon_%28movie_theater%29).


                        |Actually, during the last AMA she said she tossed it.


                        |I think you missed the '9' key there. (Either that or you guys are older than I thought)


                    |Not at all.


                        |You have been phenomenal in your series The Fall.  I hope it continues on as long as possible.  I love 
                        |atching you act.  There are few actresses that show your range and depth.  You're amazing to watch.


                    |In that case are you worried that you'll always be overshadowed by your roll in Red Shoe Diaries?


                |Triangle was just GREAT.//I'll never forget Skinner's face when Scully went all in for the kiss in the elevator


                |I just watched Triangle for the first time last night and it blew my mind. I feel like a sequel NEEDS to be mad
                | (to explain spoilers I won't post here). Please make this happen.


                |Triangle will always be a favorite of mine, must have been hell getting those 4 takes done though. Awesome epis
                |de :D


                |So many great episodes it's hard not to love all of them, but my favorite episode is "All Things" - it had such
                |an amazing look and feel to it.  ////Gillian, are there any other story lines you would have liked to explore g
                |ven the opportunity?


                |O.M.G. those are my top two episodes! It's like we're already best friends! Just like I knew we would be....


                |So did you eat the cricket?


                |I may be too late to the party but your scene in Triangle at FBI HQ is favourite scene of the series. So badass
                | 


                |agreed - Triangle was incredibly well done. Well shot, well performed, that was just good TV. They don't make i
                | like that anymore.


            |Every episode written by Darin Morgan are on my top 10 episodes list. Clyde Bruckman's final repose!


            |Almost all my favorites are the Darin Morgan or Vince Gilligan episodes. I think you guys did amazing with the addi
            |ion of a bit more humor. My favorite image is still David standing there while being described in Humbug (and of co
            |rse but I am an FBI agent). It felt like a real turning point in the series. Do you guys have favorite comedic scen
            |s or lines?


            |Jose Chung was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I'm glad you enjoyed it.


            |Just thinking about Post-Modern Prometheus makes me happy.  I don't think there has ever been a better ending to a 
            |V episode.


            |Well, you literally named all of my favorite episodes.////Also, I know you may not reply or even see this, but I've
            |had the biggest crush on you for... ever. I have butterflies just typing this. ////So... uh. Hi.


            |Small Potatoes the children's cartoon on CBeebies (children's BBC)?


            |That scene in Small Potatoes when you're looking in the mirror, complimenting yourself because you're not really Mu
            |der, you're Eddie Van Blundht. Gets me every time. I'm feeling silly just thinking about it.  Definitely my very fa
            |orite episode. And Dreamland 1 &amp; 2. ////You rule. 


            |I know no one asked, but my favorite is Arcadia.////http://x-files.wikia.com/wiki/Arcadia//


            |WOW, Post-Modern Prometheus is my favourite X-Files episode too. That final moment when Mulder and Scully brought T
            |e Great Mutato to a Cher concert was just unforgettable!


            |Jose Chung and Small Potatoes are my two favorites, I feel so validated. :)


        |I would also like to hear about Mitch. Ama request!


        |I woyld have to agree with that last sentiment.  Scully is the reason I like redheads.


    |What was it like behind the scenes during the filming of "Home"?  Did you have a sense at the time that it would become as 
    |ontroversial as it did?


        |&gt; Home////I will never be able to listen to Johny Mathis again//


        |They have repressed ever working on that episode.


    |David and Gillian, love you both!  What are your LEAST favourite episodes of The X-Files?


        |Ooh, I'd like an answer to this as well.


            |The final one. :(


                |Forget that, my least favorite episode was the Lone Gunmen's last appearance. I'm still not forgiving them for 
                |hat... =(


                    |My sentiments as well. It was an interesting episode but the fate of the Lone Gunmen pissed me off. 


                |Haha this was Bob saget's answer to "what was your favourite episode of Full House" hahahahah////That guy is to
                | funny, check out "That ain't right" if you haven't already seen it.


        |The ones with the terminator and burt reynolds


        |&gt; X-File////I would like to answer as well, the idea that it never really ended. I would like another movie where th
        | Aliens and their plot are exposed to the whole world, it can even be half way thru the movie and the 2 main stars don'
        | have to survive, this way the 'war' with aliens can start. The whole main plot of the x-files was to prove it existed 
        |o once its proven Mulder and Scully's job is actually done. 


    |This is quite the coincidence; when the X-Files first aired I must have been  just about 8 or 9 and I remember my older cou
    |ins forcing me to watch some of the more frightening episodes which ended up frightening the bejeebees out of me.////Only a
    |month ago did I begin watching the series in an attempt to get over my slightly traumatic first experience. I'm currently n
    |aring the end of Season 4 and I'm totally hooked!////**My question is:** **Looking back at the series, are there any adjust
    |ents to the characters or the plot that either of you would have liked to change or add?**


        |I wish that the lap dances I used to do as Scully in David's trailer could have been filmed. 


            |Or that David was a better tipper. 


                |This is how you know that AMA is great, interactions and jokes by OP.


            |ok now you're just messin with us.//


            |That was the sound of a hundred shippers dying of a squeal-attack.


                |Who is writing this up as a fanfic??!


            |TEASE!!!!!!!!!!!


            |Not fair, Gillian. Some of us spent our adolescence watching you, and subsequently falling in love with you. Not po
            |nting any fingers.


            |You're not the only one. Great minds think alike, eyy?


    |One of the evil twin girls (Sabrina) from the x-files episode "Eve" is in my wedding's bridal party TONIGHT. She's my best 
    |ans wife. Do you have any memories I can share with her?


        |mazel tov! wtf are you doing on reddit? 


            |Gillian and David are doing an AMA, duh.


    |Could we get a proof pic? Pretty please :)


    |Since vince Gilligan did a lot of writing for x files I'm wondering if you guys have watched breaking bad? if so how did yo
    | feel about it? 


        |I didn't watch Breaking Bad, but I will and I want to.  LOVE Vince, Love what he did on the X-files.


            |Sam here, I am looking forward to seeing it.  Everybody I know watches it.


                |Yes it's amazing!


                |It goes to some dark places, I suggest having a nice fluffy show to watch after each episode.


            |Do you remember what it was like to work with Bryan Cranston?


            |It is freaking brilliant and truly one of Vince's greatest pieces of work. 


            |so your fallout w/ Vince is over?  


    |Gillian, The Fall was spectacularly disturbing. Will you please make a thousand more? 


        |The ending, whhhhyyyyyy?


            |[spoiler alert] Because the amount of evidence was by then overwhelming: the last victim regained consciousness so 
            |ould provide a photofit and she recognised him from the bar.  They had his voice on tape from the phone call, he ha
            | no alibi, he probably left DNA at the last crime scene, the picture his daughter drew.  So I liked the ending as y
            |u knew he was about to be caught.  


                |Very true, but it had none of the satisfaction of him being caught, or at least the police knowing who it was (
                |hich I needed after all the psychological scarring), though to be honest I think that kind of ending was much b
                |tter than him being lead away in cuffs.


        |What a fantastic show. I wish they'd tell us when the second series was coming out!


        |Damn. As big of an X-Files as I am, I came here hoping to see more questions on The Fall. I'm disappointed it wasn't br
        |ught up more or that your question wasn't answered. :\


    |Gillian, can you get a guest starring role in Californication as a sort of Mulder and Scully reunion?


        |Oh, the possibilities.


        |Please!!


    |Question for David.  How did you find it working with Tim Minchin when he guested on Californication and had you seen any o
    | his comedy before meeting him?


    |David, what are the chances of Gillian guest starring on Californication? 


        |THIS 1000 times!


    |David and Gillian! It's fun just typing your names haha.. I've been an admirer of you both since 02'. I know it's totally n
    |t original to say and you may be sick to death of hearing it, but you two are awesome!! It's a wondrously/mysteriously/magi
    |ally fascinating treat watching you together onscreen (I can't pick just one adjective, sorry). You compliment each other s
    |o very well. It's kinda funny how some fans lovingly refer to your pairing as 'life-ruiners'. I think It's because you've s
    |t the bar so high. And I wanted to thank you both for doing so. My question is, do you watch each other's work? Gillian hav
    | you seen Goats? David, seen The Fall?


        |I have seen the animal Goats in Africa! What's goats?


            |Goats is with Vera Farmiga. 


                |Gillian is very good, she came and saw me in a play.  I have to admit I have not seen The Fall, but I will say 
                |hat I will watch it right after I get finished with Old Greg and the Paley Center.  People make a point of stop
                |ing me on the street and telling me how great The Fall is. 


                    |I'm Old GRreeegggggg


                        |I drink Baileys from a shoe.


                            |This is as close to baileys as you can get without getting wet.


                        |D'ya like my downstairs mixup? 


                            |You've seen my mangina!


                        |Twas a daaark, daaark niight..... And the mooon was hiiiigh...


                        |No im old gregg

                    |Dude the fall is really fucking good 


                    |Thank you David! You made my day. &lt;3 (you too Gillian)


                    |It was great.  Also, as Ms. Havisham...was the best acting I've seen.


                    |The Fall really is great.  ~~Gillian~~ Mrs. Anderson is amazing in it.////[edit] Can't believe I was so inf
                    |rmal... I had no right.


                        |This is what happens, when you're in public, and super famous.


            |Haha... He plays a weed farmer!


        |I love The Fall, the cinematography was amazing! 


    |Gillian, your look nowadays is astonishing. How did you manage to look better now than 15 years ago?
