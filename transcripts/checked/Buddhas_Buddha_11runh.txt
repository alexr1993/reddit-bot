|I live in Springfield, and I remember watching this on TV when the hearing was happening (I only had like 20 minutes to spare that night, b
|t I spent them watching that nightmare).  Its weird how you come face to face with your biases at events like this.  This guy gets up there
| introduced as a pastor, and I unfairly brace myself for homophobic ranting.  I was completely wrong.////There was also a lady who walked u
| to the microphone wearing an entirely denim dress, and for someone I thought "Oh no, here we go again", just to find out that apparently I
|m an asshole.

    |To be fair, there was no reason to think it wasn't a homophobic ranting until about two thirds of the way though his speech.

        |ID: c6p53n2, Author: OskarMao
        |He does say at the beginning that he is there in support of a bill which, according to the uploader, proposed "adding LGBT people t
        | the list of minorities protected from discrimination."  Then again, after you'd sat through enough of your fellow citizens' illogi
        |al rants, you'd probably be more inclined to think that the speaker was an idiot who accidentally recommended voting against his pr
        |ferred outcome than that he actually did support the bill and intended to expose the dated thinking underlying the opposition's "to
        |erance will destroy our way of life" argument.

        |You meant to say "no reason to think it wasn't," I presume?////Edit: To whoever downvoted - I was only trying to help -__-

        |But he made his assumption before the guy said a word about his position.

        |&gt;there was no reason to think it wasn't a homophobic ranting until about two thirds of the way though his speech.////His mischie
        |ous smirk flaring up throughout the speech was a pretty big reasons...

        |ID: c6p7gkj, Author: dirtydirtnap
        |Also to be fair, it is OK to be biased against people who wear denim outfits.

        |ID: c6p8ltb, Author: cerealpunch
        |It was more or less 3/5 of the way through for me.

        |ID: c6p7ljs, Author: blahdeblah88
        |Apart from him looking obviously gay and saying at the start that he was in favour of the bill.

    |First time I've seen our city reach the front page, glad its for something good.

        |ID: c6p4f41, Author: cuebasiscool
        |Which Springfield is this? I'm in MO and could expect this here. 

        |ID: c6p4b49, Author: pieguyfly
        |There's been a TV show about you guys for like...20 years.

        |ID: c6p4j98, Author: ImmortalSanchez
        |I was praying for a good outcome to this video as soon as I heard him say he was from here. Hell just looking through the comments,
        |it's obvious people already think Springfield is full of hicks. Last thing we need is some bad publicity on the Reddit front page.

        |ID: c6p4pwb, Author: tacobell243
        |Hell yeah! This is the proudest I've been of my city in a long long time.

        |Hey, C'mon. You guys are doing alright.

        |I can't believe it. I'm a mod over at SpringfieldMO. We're Reddit famous guys!

        |ID: c6p4u0y, Author: Felsig
        |Same here! I was expecting this guy to show the same amount of disrespect that I witness all of the time in Springfield.

        |ID: c6p7kq8, Author: SilverSeven
        |That this debate needed to happen at all is kinda sad

    |ID: c6p44oo, Author: Series_of_Accidents
    |As someone from the area, what do you think of all the comments saying that his delivery was too good and that most of the people proba
    |ly missed it?  I feel like that was probably off the mark, but you're a good person to ask!

        |ID: c6p4aqy, Author: curtisharrington1988
        |I think its important to take into consideration that these hearings went on most of the night.  A lot of the people were probably 
        |xhausted, and had heard a LOT of weird things by the time he got up there.////So I don't think it was so much "over their heads" as
        |much as it was "oh, another person is talking now".////Having said that, the pastor did a really good job.  I've been trying to loc
        |te him to let him know he's temporarily "internet famous" for at least the night.

        |Everything is getting tabled with our current council lineup.  Pretty pathetic.

    |It's called a canadian wedding dress.

    |Don't be so hard on yourself. No good has ever come from a denim dress.

    |The man introduced himself as a Missouri-born pastor at a hearing regarding gay rights.  Your initial response was completely reasonabl
    | and not mean at all. You'd be an asshole if, even after hearing his entire speech, you brushed him off just for being a pastor.  

    |ID: c6p53xa, Author: MarlanaS
    |I'm in Springfield, too, and the first time I saw this I was very surprised by the end of his speech. I was happy that so many people s
    |owed up in favor of the ordinance by not at all surprised that they tabled it. Our city council sucks.

    |Which Springfield is this? Since almost every state has a Springfield I've never heard of people referring generically to a Springfield
    | USA (except of course in regards to The Simpsons).

        |ID: c6p5maf, Author: 80G
        |He says in the begining of the video that he was born in Springfield Missouri.

    |ID: c6p5hyn, Author: that_looks__great
    |So proud of our city for getting this video out there! I love sassy pastors.

    |&gt; I only had like 20 minutes to spare that night////HEY EVERYBODY - THIS GUY A BUSY PERSON - LET'S ALL BE GRATEFUL THAT HE WAS ABLE 
    |O BLESS US WITH HIS PRESENCE

    |This is fantastic.  To be quite honest, I skipped over this post for most of the day thinking that it would be more bigoted remarks fro
    | political/religious leaders hailing from the Show Me State, but this surprised me.

    |ID: c6p5y2q, Author: dusthimself
    |I'm from Springfield too, and it wouldn't have been surprising at all knowing our city.

    |I was thinking, I don't know why I'm even bothering to listen to this shit, they always say the same nonsense and I'm sick of it.  Oh w
    |it.....  I'm so glad I did.  Good point well made.

    |My dad is a pastor. He met my mother through his gay roommate, has stood up for equal rights for decades, and never stopped loving and 
    |upporting his gay son.

    |My apologies, I'm used to hearing an American accent talk rubbish.. However, pleasantly surprised to hear sense, eventually.

    |Wearing denim makes you a homophobe?

        |ID: c6p8j1c, Author: curtisharrington1988
        |Someone didn't read the comment very thoroughly.
