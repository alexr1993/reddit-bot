Kraftwerk - The Robots &amp; Radioactivity (Live '78)(/r/Music)




    |Kraftwerk is amazing!


    |I have every piece of vinyl that Ralf &amp; Florian (Kraftwerk) released from the late 60s until today.  Their work in the 
    |0s was the definition of avante-garde.  They were an extremely important influence on David Bowie during his Berlin period,
    |and of course their early 80s album "Komputer Welt" pretty much innovated most production techniques used by rap &amp; hip-
    |op throughout that decade (and beyond).  They were creating music with synthesizers before synthesizers were ubiquitous...o
    |ten having to create their own instruments.  Their production techniques were likewise revolutionary, giving their music a 
    |aunting and cerebral quality with sound coming at you from multiple directions, fading in and out.  Their uses of repeating
    |rhythm and staccato pre-dated New Wave and obviously helped shape that genre as well.  There is a tendency for people today
    |to look at them solely as godfathers of electronica, but that really downplays the profound impact they had on sound, music
    | and production in general.  Their catalog is much greater than just "electronica;"  in fact, it isn't that at all....it is
    |really novel, weird, and truly unique.////Favorite albums:  Radioactivity and Trans-Europe Express (either German or Englis
    | versions).


        |This. It's easy to people listen to Kraftwerk now and ask "what's the big deal?", but they practically *defined*, in te
        |ms of technology, how music was going to be produced from then on. Nothing else in the 70's sounds anything like them, 
        |ut the 80's? Their pioneering of electronic music practically gave birth to 80's synth pop and everything else that ste
        |med from it.//////Without Kraftwerk, (ok, someone else would have probably done it sooner or later, but that's not the 
        |oint) there's no techno, there's no trance, no dubstep.


        |This is what Kraftwerk sounded and looked like in the beginning: ////[Köln II (live 1970)](http://www.youtube.com/watch

        |I've got an original UK pressing of Autobahn. It's my pride and joy.


    |I actually thought about submitting the non-live video for this song last night, and didn't because music this old never do
    |s well in /r/Music.  ////It's somewhat obvious how influential Kraftwerk were to electronic music.  Less obvious is how hug
    |ly influential they were to hip hop.  


        |I saw an interview with George Clinton where he stated that Kraftwerk were "The most funky thing he'd ever heard."//


        |&gt; It's somewhat obvious how influential Kraftwerk were to electronic music.////The intro to that song sounded suspic
        |ously familiar:////http://youtu.be/2Tv6-pcsxmM


    |Holy mother of strange.//


    |[Amon Duul II](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQZivghQU-Q) are my favorite from my very limited experience in krautrock. Th
    |y are much closer to psych rock and sound nothing like Kraftwerk. I think that's pretty common in krautrock... there doesn'
    | seem to be any specific sound associated with the genre.


        |Basically if you're a German band, you're Krautrock.


    |Seeing them next friday with my dad.////Fun fact: He named me after Florian Schneider.


        |I am also going to the Kraftwerk concert next week in Eindhoven! gonna be fun

    |I'm still blown away by the fact that Radioactivity was made in the 70s, it is an amazing track.


    |Here's the [full video](http://youtu.be/9gcsEDmycRg)


    |aaaaand GEMA. Not that as a German I had any right to enter the discussion on that piece of music/art.

    |Yessss. They invented electronic music. 


    |What? I've listened to Kraftwerk casually for years, so I feel kinda stupid that I'm just now learning they were around in 
    |he 70's... Fuck, I don't even know how to feel about that haha. I'd always had the impression they started in the early '90
    |, and still considered them somewhat if a pioneer of electronic music. Learning they've been jamming for so long blows my m
    |nd and kinda puts their stuff into a larger perspective for me.////


    |Kraftwerk built robots to tour for them so they didn't have to.  They also became operators of pocket calculators somewhere
    |down the line, but that's not what's important.  In the 90s shit got real, and realer scary, FAST.  Using their robot, synt
    |esizer, and appliance resumes, Kraftwerk  merged with Kenmore of Sears Roebuck and assoicates to form Kraftmore as an effor
    | to subvert the personal computer crash of 2000.   And that's when it happened:  ////Nothing at all.  The globe churned and
    |babies were born, and some others were aborted.  But that's all because of Kraftwerk and their devotion to dance, since man
    |dancing is society dancing, and society dancing is a society thriving.  And the latest dance craze? ////Twerking.  Yeah, Kr
    |ftwerk invented it.  No big surpise, breakers used to pop, lock, freeze and spin on cardboard from the boxes of Kraftmore a
    |pliances while listening to Kraftmore boom boxes blasting Planet Rock by Africa Bambatta(which sampled Kraftwerk)   ////Kra
    |twerk actually means white power in German//

            |sorry, next time i'll aim for more.


                |You're funny, don't let any blue arrow tell you otherwise.


        |of course the sheeple would downvote me.  Kraftwerk used to be called Organisation, which was short for an Organisation
