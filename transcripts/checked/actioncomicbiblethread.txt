Madonna Banned From Alamo Drafthouse After Texting During '12 Years A Slave' NYFF Premiere(/r/Movie News &amp; Discussion)




    |Went to see X-Men First Class with a party of 5 people. Got there late, couldn't find 5 consecutive seats. Guy stands up an
    | asks his kids to stand up too, then they shuffle out and sit one row down where there were 4 free seats. As we're passing 
    |hem by I notice the courteous group of people are Sean "Puffy" Combs and his kids. Needless to say, none of them texted a l
    |tter or did anything else retarded throughout the movie.////And that's how I fell in love with Puff Daddy.


        |I've listened to interviews with him and he's a very courteous individual. Can't say I've ever heard of him being a too
        | or anything and this just confirms it. Kudos to his situational awareness, too.


            |You should watch *Get Him to The Greek*.


                |I've got six fucking kids!!! Do you know how many Air Jordans six black kids wear?


                    |[That scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0y_y1mhjBY) is one of the best comedic movie moments I have se
                    |n. So many current TV stars in it too. Jake Johnson from The New Girl, Nick Kroll from The League, Aziz Ans
                    |ri from Parks and Rec, and Ellie Kemper from The Office. They all have one little memorable bit in it, and 
                    |t's all together amazing. 


                        |Chocolate Daddy


                            |I'm proud of those units


                        |And the bartender from Forgetting Sarah Marshall. [Yeah bitch!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-bWf2QD
                        |vw)


                        |best comedic scene for me was that G.O.A.T dialogue between Diddy and Pharrell. cracked the fuck up////

                            |Thanks for the link, that was hilarious!////(In all seriousness, that was formatted weird and I don
                            |t know what to look for, could you link me or give me more info?)


                        |Bahahahahahahahahaha!  Oh man thank you for that. I never saw that movie but that is fucking hysterical
                        | Like tom cruise in tropic thunder or something. I love the league and I like aziz ansari. Watching rux
                        |n and him was hilarious. "Just shut the fuck up man". Thank you for sharing that. Ha.. Still chuckling.


                            |I love the last thing that Kroll says too "I'm sorry for my outburst, I think I'm having a panic at
                            |ack" ////It's missing one little tid bit (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Y-l40swH0)  that Ellie K
                            |mper does. She doesn't say anything but just white girl nods to this super gangster ass song at the
                            |end. Just a little bit which turned out to be hilarious. ////


                        |The only part of that movie I disliked was that it's some kind of a joke that Jonah Hill's character ge
                        |s raped. I hate that shit in comedy. 


                            |I dont think it was completely making light of the rape. Its showed that Jonah was traumatised and 
                            |he other characters were assholes for ignoring it. ////It didnt take the subject very seriously but
                            |I dont think it was pro-male-rape either.


                                |I felt like the movie made it seem like he was cheating, that scene just made me feel really un
                                |omfortable, and I couldn't find any comedy in the rest of the movie because they just kinda gla
                                |ed over it like "yeah, this is a thing that happens... now for more jokes!" then his girlfriend
                                |s solution is to sleep with Russell Brand. I just hate when movies throw that bullshit "you fuc
                                |ed someone so now I get to fuck someone so that our relationship is even" card. No, what you ne
                                |d to do is deal with it like adults and communicate about it. If your solution is to continue t
                                |e escapade of meaningless sex, then you were never fully invested in a monogamous relationship.
                                |The idea that sleeping with someone outside your relationship means that you won something that
                                |your SO didn't is ridiculous, it means that your relationship either needs work or it needs to 
                                |nd.  //It just astounds me how casual people are about cheating and having affairs, or in this 
                                |ase, rape.


                                    |To be fair, when that payback sex comes up in movies, the outcome usually isn't positive. 


                                        |Unless it's a girl doing it, then it's justice and empowering.


                            |How dare a comedy make light of a serious situation with humor!  


                            |Not having seen that movie, do you mean *This is the End*? 


                                |Spoiler alert goddamnit. And no, if you read a couple comments up, they're talking about *Get H
                                |m to the Greek*.


                                    |Dude. You need to see that movie. It's the funniest movie I can remember ever seeing. ////I

                                        |Saw it last Friday - spoiler alert wasn't for me. Now I'm just hoping nobody reads this
                                        |far down so *they* won't get *This is the End* spoiled.//////No one likes getting spoil
                                        |d, man.

                                |Yes

                    |Thank you for saying this! I say this every time Biggest Loser is on and no one gets it. 


                |He makes the movie.


                    |For real. Until that point I had no idea he could be pants-shittingly hilarious. 


                    |Many people make that movie. That movie was a damn good time.


                        |yeah I feel like Russel Brand really stole the show for me


                            |Erm…he _was_ the show…the whole movie centered around him.


                            |It probably doesnt work without Brand.

                    |Yes

                            |No problem I guess I was just the right hip 21 year old for the job. 


                            |He started out as Sean Combs (real name).////Then he was Sean "Puffy" Combs aka "Puff Daddy" (back

                                |At least until he converts to rastafarianism. I'm gonna love Puff Lion. 


                                    |Maybe the Cat Stevens route?

                    |His name is just Diddy now. Drop the P.


                        |Much like R. Kelly,  the P was getting between him and the fans

                    |He also used to go by Puffy.

                    |Where the hell have you guys been at? It's just "Diddy" now.


                    |I hope you're sitting down because I am here to tell you that he is also Sean Coombs.


                        |I wasn't sitting down and because of which I was in no way prepared for that information.


                    |After a google search I now know that P Diddy and Kanye West are not the same person.


                        |This is also news to me.


                    |Ahem,////I believe he prefers to be called P-Diddles.

                |he's geoffrey'd, run for it!


                |He has some solid comedic chops in the movie. There are very few movies where I am laughing hard and for so lon
                | that I seriously need to tap out, and have somebody hit pause. The Vegas party scene is definitely one of the 
                |wo that I can think of.////The other one is the balloon/cow/cross dressing Lucy's scene in rat race.


                |WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?! IMMA FUCKING KILL YOU!! SMILEY FACE!!


                |That movie makes me wonder why Puff hasn't been in more comedies. Get Him to The Greek is probably my favorite

                |*whispers*: I'm not sucking his dick. That's like 100%.


                |Having seen it, I wish he'd consider doing more acting. He has a talent there that has hardly been tapped.

            |My father and I work for the company that owns Ciroc Vodka which Mr. Combs endorses.  We've gotten to eat a few mea
            |s with him and have been in a bunch of meetings with him.  From those few encounterings he's a really cool guy and 
            |onsidering his status/wealth is pretty down to earth.   Even paid for our meals and got me a steak to take home.///
            |//He did bend us over with the deal he got from Ciroc so I'm not sure if that changes things.


                |You got an *ultra-premium* deal.////Seriously, you did. Vodka is vodka, it's a neutral spirit. The only reason 
                |Ciroc* commands top dollar is because arrivistes buy it to show they can, as a form of ostentatious display, no
                | because of any inherent properties of the product. And that's because it is endorsed by Sean Combs, a man famo
                |s merely for his own ostentatious displays.


                    |exhibit a: crystaaaaaal


                    |Yes and no.  We probably could've gotten him for a quarter of what were paying him now realistically.  We j
                    |st didn't know it would b this big.  Its a total first world problem, but still isn't fun seeing him  cash

                        |Cash checks you're paying him? I'm confused. He's making big money cuz y'all are making bigger money, r
                        |ght?


                            |Exactly, fucking rich people complaining about being rich and not being as rich.


                        |the only reason my friends started drinking Ciroc is because either they knew it was endorsed by Diddy 
                        |r it had gotten popular because it was endorsed by Diddy


                    |You're partially right.  Everything is about branding, not just Vodka.  Sugar drinks being the clearest exa
                    |ple.  //  //And yes, vodka tends to be valued less for its distinct flavours than, say a scotch or a port. 
                    | //  //But.  Even if we ignore those who do enjoy vodka's subtleties, there is a significant difference bet
                    |een cheap paint thinner vodka and smooth premium vodka and it does no one any good to pretend vodka is all 
                    |he same.


                |Being a schrewd business man is nothing to be ashamed of.


                    |Let us prey. 


                        |That's often what they do.


                    |I have a hard time agreeing with that blanket statement. ////Some people might say a shrewd businessman mig
                    |t use cheap labor aka slaves - there's certainly something inherently wrong with slavery. ////But hey, usin
                    | slaves is a shrewd business decision, right? 


                        |Correct.

        |The thing I love about Alamo Drafthouse is there is literally NO WAY you could not know about this rule, they hammer it

        |eir forehead as the kind of people who presume all rules don't apply to them. Then we'll all just see them coming from

            |Not only do we have at least one warning before each movie, we give each guest we catch talking or texting a verbal
            |warning before we kick them out. I never feel bad at all about kicking guests out, and usually the other customers 
            |n the theater are happy that we do eject the rude customers, and leave better tips and sometimes notes thanking us.


                |How do tips go at alamo anyways? Seems like you'd get a lot of people who get caught up in the ending and forge

                        |Good on you, I also wear a watch and when I'm at the movies and want to check the time I take my phone

                        |There's also a mathematical formula for figuring out what time it is during the movie.////Suppose you g

                    |Oddly enough the times ive seen it they arent sitting close to me and I feel it would be very rude of me to

                |If someone can pull their phone out and have the light shielded at all times then I don't mind if they want to 
                |heck the time.  But really if you're going to a movie, why would you need to check the time?  Movie starts at 6
                |30, average runtime for a film is 90-120minutes.  So that means you will very likely be out of the theater at e
                |ther 8:00 or 8:30.  Everyone knows this before going in to the movie, so if the film isn't over yet, you can re
                |t easy in knowing that it's not 8:30 yet.  //In fact, many websites tell you the runtime of the film before you
                |go see it, so you can calculate exactly when you'll be out of the theater.


                    |One night while out at lowes my fiance was all hey lets go see a movie so we go to the theater and he picks

                    | I had finished work. They had a shit ton of previews and started the movie late so toward the last half I 
                    |ad to check the time a few times. I had to leave early and didn't get to finish it. I was the only one in t

                        |As long as you did the first one discreetly so no one had to see your phone glare, there's no problem w

                |Do what I do, if someone is talking loudly or texting in front of me, I toss a bit of popcorn to get their atte
                |tion, lean in, and whisper to them to shut the fuck up/put that shit away.


                |See i'll use my phone to check the time, but i'll keep it inside my handbag while I do it to try and reduce the
                |light as much as possible, no way I want to annoy people.////edit: just to be clear it's not like I check it al

                    |Can I ask why you need to check the time during a movie? Are you going to leave halfway through for some ot

                        |I'll check the time if the movie is boring. When I saw After Earth, I couldn't stop looking at the time

                        |you're wondering why I paid to see After Earth in the theatre, I was actually going to see This Is The

                            |No worries, I paid to see Battlefield Earth- but only because after the reviews I *had* to see this
                            |in theaters and watch the reaction of the audience. Good times were had.


                        |Curiosity most of the time. Also sometimes it's hard to judge when a movie will actually end because th

                        |be unsure what time it will actually end.


                            |Hypothetical: you do have plans for after the movie, which is running longer than you previously th
                            |ught. Do you leave the movie early?


                                |Depends on the plans and if I can afford to be late for them, as well as how late I would be. 


                            |Two questions:////1) If you have plans afterwards, aren't you checking the length of the movie befo
                            |e hand?////2) If the adds are of indeterminate length, can't you just check the time once, when the
                            |movie is starting/about to start, and know when it will end?


                        |When I saw Thor in the cinema, halfway through I really needed to pee. So I used my phone to check the 
                        |ime a couple of times to try to guess how long was left and if could hold on till the end(which I did).


                    |Yeah of just bend down and do it as low to the ground as possible. Theres ways to do it.

            |common courtesy to me has always been this:////* during the pre-movie previews when the lights are at full intensit

                |I agree, but the article wasn't written by Tim League, it was written by Indiewire. So no need to accuse Drafth

                    |But why not accuse them? I mean, it really is a blatant coat-tail marketing scheme to publicly ban a celebr

                        |I disagree about accusing the Drafthouse of trying to gain publicity out of it. Anyone following them o

        |I wouldn't be surprised if this is a double dose of marketing.////Madonna's people are probably behind the original art

        |It was certainly a cheap publicity stunt for the film. Might as well jump on that bandwagon.


        |The Drafthouse is a well loved and respected cinema in Austin and expanding to many other cities.  It's often the locat
        |on for a film debut in Austin.  It is not inconceivable that Madonna may one day face the prospect of choosing not to a

        |I dunno about blatant marketing scheme, but it is a bit presumptuous to ban someone like this. It's kind of like me ban

        |There's a very small chance that it was tongue-in-cheek.////Also it was probably made up.


    |I'm totally for this. People shouldn't text during movies.////But when I went to a movie at the Alamo Drafthouse, there wer
    | waitresses taking orders for food and delivering them during the movie. It seems like that's just as disruptive to the mov

        |Absolutely... even more so.


            |Am I the only one whose not really bothered by people texting during movies?////I mean if they're right next to you
            |sure, but most of the time I don't even notice.////A waitress walking up and down the aisles taking orders and serv

                |I'm not bothered by it. Turn the brightness down all the way on any smart phone and it isn't disruptive in the

                |Smart phones now are brighter than the maglite I keep on my keychain. It bothers me.

                | it does ruin that feeling of convivial togetherness that makes being part of an audience so much fun. 


            |Have you ever been to Alamo? They actually have it set up really well and it is as not intrusive as it can possibly
            |be. I mean the servers walk around crouching so the do not disturb people views. They really got it figured out, th
            |t's why they've expanded from just Austin, to nationwide in only the last 6 years. 


            |And the noises of people chewing... oh God.////I don't get why people have a compulsion to eat at the movies. It's 
            |ike going to play a round of tennis and trying to eat while playing. There's nothing that connects the two activiti
            |s and each of them stands in the way of the other. Just plan ahead and have a meal before. It's not that hard.////A
            |so, why are popcorn and crisps the number one choice for food at the cinema? It's as if someone sat down and though
            | of the two loudest possible culinary choices possible. The only thing worse would be someone eating soup while slu
            |ping. I really don't think I could sit through 5 minutes of listening to someone slurping. The chewing isn't much b
            |tter, though.////Could someone who likes to eat at the movies please tell me why the fuck someone would want to do 
            |hat? It's distracting to yourself and everybody else and on some level even disrespectful to the movie. Watching Sc
            |indler's List for the first time while chowing down on a bucket of chicken wings with greasy fingers and face seems
            |pretty vulgar and tacky.


                |As someone who has a bit of a problem sitting down for an entire movie that isn't the Godfather, eating popcorn
                |is the perfect thing for a movie. There's enough in one bag/bowl/whatever that it keeps my hands busy and the p
                |rt of my brain that likes to wander off is kept busy. Also, a full stomach tends to keep me docile enough to si
                | through the rest of the movie (drinks help with that too). The sound of popcorn being eaten has become so syno
                |ymous with any movie-going experience of mine that I always wind up tuning it out. ////Waitresses bringing food
                |out to you sounds either as annoying or more annoying than cellphones.


                |Eating doesn't distract me in the slightest.  Since damn near everyone else is also eating, I doubt it distract

                    |&gt;nobody eats chicken wings at a theater.////I guess you've never been to an Alamo Drafthouse.//


                        |I haven't, never heard of it before today.  That sounds awful.  Do they actually sell it at the theater
                        |  Theaters here in Canada don't allow outside food to be brought in.


                            |Yep, that's how it works. If you're not there at the last minute, waiters usually get your food out
                            |by the time the previews start, but you can still order stuff throughout the movie.////I like it, b
                            |t I can definitely see how it could be annoying to many. I'm always self-conscious when eating chip

                |Austinite here who enjoys going to the Alamo Drafthouse precisely because they have food and beverage.  Having 
                | meal with a movie is enjoyable and it allows my wife and I to knock out dinner and a movie in one shot (only t
                |kes up 2 hours instead of 3+).  We rarely have the free time to go out together so the efficiency helps.  We're
                |completely capable of giving our full attention to the movie while eating (eating doesn't require thinking).  M
                |st people are respectful while eating in the theater and make an effort to be quiet plus the volume of the movi
                | drowns a lot out.  Also, disrespectful and distracting?  Everyone in the theater is there for the same reason 
                | to eat and enjoy a movie.  I'm also not worried about offending the movie with my "disrespect" since it doesn'
                | have feelings.  There are plenty of other theaters to attend if you want to keep food out of it.


        |Yup.  I know that's their gimmick, but I wasn't used to it at first and it annoyed me.  That being said, if I can ignor
        | people walking up to me, past me, blocking the screen momentarily, hearing food wrappers and stuff, then cell phones a
        |en't/shouldn't be a big deal.  


            |I dont really understand why its a big deal anyway...i mean, if the.phones silent, and in someones lap like they us

            |ent actually encoumteted this phenomenon.


        |No, not even remotely.  If the movie is currently playing, they duck down below the tables and they certainly don't hav
        | a bright ass LCD screen shining for everyone to see.  This is such an apparent distinction, that I highly doubt you ha

        |I guess it is to be expected in this subreddit, but personally I think people overblow the texting issue. If you aren't

            |...It's a bright light in a dark room, how do people not notice?////I go to a few theaters very often throughout th
            | week and whenever someone whips out their phone it's incredibly visible and distracting. It makes it hard to look 
            |t the actual movie because it's like someone is sitting there with a flashlight. If the theater wasn't DARK, then y
            |ah whatever it wouldn't matter, but every theater I've been too it's so dark they need tiny little dim lights along
            |the walkways so you know where you are going. How would a bright-ass phone NOT be distracting? Unless you aren't ta
            |king about the texting not being noticable, then....well then sorry I wasted your time.


                |Honestly, I've never had this issue at all. Theatre seats are descending in height, so usually I can't directly
                |see the phone of the people sitting in front of me. Also if I'm focused on something it takes more than a brigh
                | light to completely sway my attention. I'd have crashed my car a thousand times otherwise!////The whole thread
                |has me kinda weirded out, really. Maybe it's just an american thing? Luckily I never text at the movies because
                | well, I want to enjoy them!


                    |The most pointless thing to bitch about ever. When I'm in a movie and see someone texting, it doesn't even 
                    |ross my mind that it's distracting. I just go "oh, someone's looking at their phone. Back to the movie." I 
                    |on't see how someone can be so engrossed in a movie that even a tiny glimmer of light fucks their whole exp
                    |rience up. There's a lot of other shit that pisses me off before texting.


                    |Hmmm, it also has to do with different light sensitivities? I swear it lights up the entire section the per
                    |on with the phone is sitting in. They'll be across the theater and rows and rows in front of me and it's li
                    |e they're holding a flashlight aimed near my face. It really takes away from the experience of immersion in
                    |the movie I pay for, which is why they always show on the screen to not text during the movie, at least the
                    | do in the united states. Do they not show messages like that before the movie in other countries?//// Also
                    | I wonder if maybe american theaters are set up differently? Maybe you have more of a drop in height for ea
                    |h row than we do in our theaters, or maybe our theaters are set up to be darker...who knows? I mean it real
                    |y depends on the theater even within the country so it makes sense that it would vary from country to count
                    |y, I suppose.


                |Because it is a tiny little light in comparison to the huge screen giving off huge amounts of light? I guess th
                |t is how. I really don't notice and I think it is fine for people to use texts if they need to. It's better tha
                | getting up or talking On the phone, after all. 


            |I agree. I mean, I get it. It's annoying and people should not do it, but the seething hatred that has become so co
            |mon is kind of ridiculous. Of course I think it goes in hand with what seems like way too many people taking movies
            |too seriously in the first place. The type of people going to Pacific Rim and then complaining that it didn't forev
            |r alter their lives with thought provoking art. 


            |What is distracting about it to these crybabies? The light? There's a giant fucking screen in front of you and you 
            |oticed the tiny little cell phone light?


                |An entirely dark theater and you don't think people notice this giant bright light? Maybe if all phones were on

                |ss release. This is not a marketing piece for the drafthouse. 


                    |Yes I understand that Drafthouse has excellent value at a price that I can afford*!*


            |She wasn't even at the Alamo Drafthouse. She was in a different theater. 


            |She knew she would get caught because the theater paid her a lot of money to be able to say the kicked out Madonna.


                |She didn't get caught; no one complained and not even the Alamo would kick out Madonna I'm sure.


                    |It wasn't at the Alamo.


                        |That's what he's saying. 


        |Totally. And losing Madonna's patronage isn't nearly a loss. 


            |Madonna could probably almost buy the whole chain out if she felt like it.


    |Texting in movies is terrible.////My only problem with this is that Madonna was allegedly at a premiere in New York (not an
    |Alamo theater) when the movie critic says she was texting. If she wasn't a publicly recognized person, she wouldn't be call
    |d out on the internet and banned for allegedly being rude. By all means, ban everyone - even celebrities - if you actually 
    |atch them texting in your theater, but this seems a bit much.//


        |Don't tell reddit. They're too busy jumping to sweeping conclusions.


    |Maybe she was trying to send photo?


    |Good. People who do this are insufferable. I saw gravity last night and a girl was not only texting through the whole thing
    | but she left the phone on in her cupholder when she wasn't using it, and since she was in the front row, it shined up in e
    |erybody's eyes. Multiple people yelled at her to turn her phone off, but she didn't until the last 15 minutes. I was comple
    |ely immersed until I noticed her phone, at which point it completely distracted me from the rest of the movie. I wish she h
    |d been banned.


        |Ever since mobile phones first started to become popular, I've had fantasies about dressing up in a gorilla costume and
        |smashing people's phones who are using them at inappropriate times. I know it's juvenile and having your property destr
        |yed is not a fair penalty for being rude, but I'll be damned if it's not a satisfying fantasy.


            |Yeah, that would certainly be less distracting.


            |If I ever text or use my phone in a movie theater please feel free to dress up as a gorilla, take my phone, and sma
            |h it. 


        |you have to make a scene - stand up and shout at her inches away from her face "YOU STUPID FUCKING CUNT - TURN YOUR PHO
        |E OFF" ... that usually does it


            |I purposely buy a box of Dots at the movies when I am worried about a texted ruining it for me. They are the perfec
            | size and weight to throw and accuracy is easily achieved.

                |I've had people booted from theatres before - rich-bitch woman from Spain with her kids insisted on talking ful

        |People like you are just as much to blame for not doing anything about it. //////Confront the person, if they don't sto

        |Once had a group of loud teens come in and sit in the very front during a movie. Like an hour into it. They were both t
        |lking and on their phones.  Eventually, an older guy went down and asked them (and specifically this girl) to pipe down
        | I'd say about 20-30 mins later, they got up and left. Someone shouted, "THANK YOU FOR LEAVING."////How does someone no
        |mally get theater management to kick some one out or something during a movie? I honestly thought someone in the projec

        |I had someone in the row in front of me slipping their phone out  for the third time in 10 minutes during some big new 
        |ovie. I leaned over an whispered, ' I'm going to throw your phone against the wall if I see it again.'//No more phone a

    |This is the biggest load of pretentious horse shit I have read in a long time.


    |Id be texting too if i was obligated to go to a screening i didnt want to attend. 


    |This is why I drive 30 minutes to the only Alamo Drafthouse in CO, because I like my movies with a side of buttery popcorn

                |With marketing schemes like this, I'm sure they're doing fine.


                |There is the Brewvies Cinema Pub in Salt Lake City which has the same concept.


            |That's some great news! 


        |The food is okay and a little overpriced but for food brought to me during a movie, I have no complaints at all. 


            |The food is okay, the popcorn is definitely better than most, but I wouldn't go if they didn't have the no texting/
            |o talking policy and reserved online seating. Best popcorn definitely goes to the Landmark chain. 


        |"she was at was at the Lincoln Center Walter Read Theatre, NOT at an Alamo Drafthouse."


            |Admittedly, I did not read anything but the headline before I posted that. 


                |Yeah, lots of people here didn't read it either. Admittedly, I am a fan of hers, and she messed up here big tim
                |, but saying she's the "worst person in the world" and all this is really taking it too far. They're just drumm
                |ng up publicity for the (wrong) theatre. And all the ageist comments and hate in here aren't particularly origi
                |al and there's just so much animosity for her, it's unlike anything I've seen towards any celebrity aside from 
                |aybe Justin Beiber.


                    |Yeah, I don't really have anything against Madona in particular. I was a little girl in the 1980s, it would
                    |be pretty hard for me to hate Madonna since I spent a great deal of my youth in a mirror lip-syncing to Tru

        |I can get that at home.////I like the communal experience of watching a movie with lots of people who live near me, and

        |ust about me and my petty, anal entertainment preferences, but actually involves existing with and getting along with o
        |hers.


            |Oh, stop. Sure, we all like laughing together at the funny parts and gasping at the shocking parts, but can you hon
            |stly say it brings warm communal feelings to your heart when someone basically shines a flashlight in your face whi
            |e you're watching a movie?  ////Besides, the person texting isn't being communal with *you,* they're chatting with 
            |omeone who isn't even in the damn theater. 


                |Yeah, you missed the point. Sometimes you have to put up with other humans.


                    |We shouldn't ask people not to be rude and inconsiderate?  I'm afraid I must respectfully disagree. 


            |Everyone has their tastes and priorities. I go to the theater because I love movies and want to see as many as I ca
            | on a big screen with a nice sound system. There are plenty of theaters that don't have staunch policies on talking
            |and texting, people that want to be able to talk to their neighbors and text freely can happily go to those.  


                |Nobody likes a lot of talking.


        |How loud is texting?


            |for me it is the brightness of the screen lighting up a large area that is the most distracting.


                |Hopefully people who text today put the screen brightness all the way down.


                    |Or dont text in a movie. How hard can it be to go out of the theater or just enjoy the a few hours offline.


                        |or only text during outdoor scenes 


                            |Or don't go to the cinema is you can't not text for 2 hours. 


                    |Even with the brightness all the way down it's still brighter than the surrounding darkness of the theater.
                    |Peripheral vision is really good at picking up dim lights.


                        |oh have to wait until a scene that's very bright, also only for emergencies 


                            |Even a really bright scene is not going to overpower a phone screen. It's about contrast. The area 
                            |ou are sitting in is dark. If there is a light in that area it is going to stand out. A bright scre
                            |n is not going to light up the seating area enough to make a phone screen not noticeable.////If it'

            |The sound of the screaming in my mind when I'm distracted by someone else's cell phone screen is pretty loud. 


    |Hyperbolic TMZ-esque bullshit, also I'd rather watch a movie one frame at a time on a ViewMaster before giving a penny to h
    |pster cunts like those that run the ADH. P.S. That phone ad that everyone jacks off about, is fake.

                |Or a fan who heard from the AMA via other social media sites and created an account to have the chance to ask M

                    |That's what I was getting at


                |Dude... THOUSANDS of fans made Reddit accounts just to ask her questions. This is common with celebrity AMAs. N

            |I read the Bible, but that does not change the fact it is bullshit.

        |Why is she a bitch?


            |Genetics? Who knows really.


        |Considering that she wasn't in the Alamo Drafthouse and that her texting during a film is from a secondhand account, I 
        |hink her bitch status is unverified at this point.


        |She did an AMA?

    |Madonna lets her homeless brother rot under a bridge, evenin the winter.  With the mega millions she has, she can lift a fi
    |ger to help out in any way.  This selfish behaviour comes as no surprise.  Doesnt matter if the wrong theatre was mentioned


    |Madonna is still alive eh?  Neat.


    |I like that they actually enforce their no electronics policy.


    |Madonna is a cunt.


    |Did she actually call "Enslaver" the woman asking her to stop? That'd be double the stupid and triple the funny.


        |I don't believe that, lol.  This article also calls her "The Worst Person in America". .... really? for texting during 
        | movie? I think that's a little extreme.


            |They rate right up there with genocidal maniacs, in my opinion.


                |Whoa, I don't know that genocidal maniacs are quite *that* bad. At least they know about common courtesy.


            |I believe its part of a larger group.  


            |Yea it's 2nd hand from a student to a teacher, then taken off the teachers Facebook page.  I'm guessing quite a bit
            |of exaggeration went into both retellings.


            |Texting during a movie = worse than Hitler, apparently.


            |Yeah. A lot of perp seem to really fucking hate it. I don't see what the big deal is. 


                |It's not the texting, is having a light in front of you that distracts the people behind you.


        |Madonna has never shown that much wit before


    |The worst person in America?  Come the fuck on, now...


    |I always wonder why people text during movies, plays or anything that just requires a few hours of your focus. It's stupid 
    |ow people today can't enjoy and immerse themselves in the culture and beauty of something without their nose fucking deep i
    | their phones.


    |Atleast she wasn't making out with someone during Schindler's List!


    |I'd have given most anything to have gone to that premier! That movies looks spectacular, it not only has a wonderful moral
    |purpose, it has some great actors and actresses in it. Including one of my favourites, Benedict Cumberbatch...I think if I 
    |as there, I'd have slapped her. But, then again, whoever was watching her text and documenting that during the first half o
    | the movie she was texting, that person, obviously wasn't watching the film either. WHY don't I get invited to movie premie
    |s like this?! I'd watch the film more intently than Madonna! :\


    |Needless to say there would be hell to pay if this was anyone else doing this during a Madonna movie premiere.


    |Good.  Rules aren't selective.  And they will get my business so long as they enforce them for all.


    |What a Bitch!


    |At the beginning of every film shown at the draft house, you are warned not to use your cell phone. Hahah she deserved it


    |Oh Madonna could just buy the Alamo drafthouse...


    |So.. she was not even at an alamo draft house when she did it.////What a bunch of pr whores.


    |the special hell//http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtvfaFItLhg


    |assholes like this are why i dont go to the movies anymore... screw paying $20 only to have someone ruin it for you. sticki
    |g to my 60 inch widescreen tyvm


    |I don't like going to the movies anymore because of rude assholes talking and texting. I wish there was an Alamo Drafthouse
    |in New Orleans. I would easily pay more so I could enjoy my movie.


    |I can't stand Madonna.


    |God I hate the comments on the linked website. it's reminds me of the crowd over at Perez Hilton. they like to act like the
    | know celebrities personally and that they could speak for them. no self respect among any of them.


    |YOU WERE MAKING OUT DURING SCHINDLER'S LIST?!


        |Was that wrong, should I not have done that, was there a memo,,,, I gotta tell I have to plead ignorance on this one.


    |Her own films are bad enough, does she have to ruin everyone else's?


    |"I'm sorry, but you can't text during the movie."////"Do you know who I am?"////"Yes, you're the bitch who's getting kicked
    |out for texting during the movie."


        |Thank you and join us next week for another edition of "I only read the title of the post and this is my fantasy about 
        |hat."//////It's not nearly that satisfying unfortunately. 


        |Only she didn't get kicked out.


        |seeing the reactions elicited, i would expect some huge dude to walk up to them and say "yo comon with me"
