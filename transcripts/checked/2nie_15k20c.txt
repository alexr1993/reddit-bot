    |Does bringing a child into the world automatically bestow a person with perfect balance? Seriously. I see moms/dads balancing a baby in
    |one hand at my job, and groceries + a toddler in the other, like no big deal. I can't even carry a full cup of coffee. WHAT IS THE DEAL

        |A couple weeks after our daughter was born, my wife was laying on the couch with the baby sleeping on her lap, and I was making din
        |er. I carried a plate of food over for my wife, and while I was handing it to her, the fork slid off the plate and started dropping
        |towards the baby. My wife's hand shot out and caught that fork out of the air like we had practiced it a million times. Before that
        |moment I wouldn't have trusted my wife to catch a tennis ball if she was wearing a velcro suit. ////

        |That is my biggest fear about children; I'm absent-minded and clumsy so infants freak me out. I'm totally down with toddlers though
        | they're built like trucks so they can fall down a flight of stairs and still be honor students later in life. If I get that matern
        |l urge, I would adopt 1 year olds so I can bypass tender infant stage.

        |You would be amazed how parenthood bestows super human abilities onto a person. I can recall tripping over a megablock while holdin
        | my two year old. I managed to fall in such a way that I threw my arms out in front of me, holding my son in them and he and my arm
        | landed safely on the couch while the rest of me smacked into the hardwood floor. ////He thought the experience was much more enter
        |aining than I did.

        |Once I tripped down the last two stairs carrying my infant daughter. I executed a perfect ninja roll when I hit the ground, cradlin

        |Ok not all parents are that graceful. My kid is 3 and to this day, people tell me not to run in the rain with her. I am proud to sa

    |Wait till she has croup and the only thing to stop her screaming is rocking her back and forth for *hours*. ////One daddy to another: p
    |ease consider investing in a good rocking chair, and put that rocking chair in front of a TV. Both my kids had bad croup, and I'd cradl
    | them while rocking them back and forth and watching episode after episode of Star Trek or The Wire. It's the only way my wife could ge
    | any sleep. ////If you have a recliner that vibrates, it's almost as good. The motion and sound calms screaming babies. ////Also: take 
    |aps whenever the opportunity presents itself. When the baby falls asleep, you should be asleep if possible, or at least in bed relaxing
    | Like soldiers in combat, never give up a chance to grab 15 or 20 minutes' rest. ////After a few weeks, sleep deprivation will cause bo
    |h of you to become short tempered with each other. *Do not take it personally*, it's just exhaustion and hormones talking. You or your 
    |ife may say things you regret. Pretend it didn't happen and move on with your lives is my advice. ////Make sure you have infant Tylenol
    | baby powder (EDIT: see end), moisturizer, and Mylicon on hand at all times. Those four things are like the WD40 and duct tape of infan
    |s, they will fix 95% of all problems. In a couple months, add Orajel to the list. Seriously, have these things in your pockets *at all 
    |imes* when you leave the house with the baby. ////You will smell like formula for the next six months. Deal with it. ////Keep a cloth d
    |aper close at hand at all times, and use it, especially if you are going to be within six feet of the baby and you are already dressed 
    |or work. If you are going to be holding the baby, put the diaper over your shoulder before putting the baby down. Basically, treat the 
    |iaper as a tarp and your baby as a leaky engine. Spread the tarp first so your engine doesn't spit up formula all over your nice clean 
    |riveway. ////And remember, this will all be worth it. Having kids is the best thing ever. Nothing else you do in your personal or profe
    |sional life will ever be as important as being a good daddy. ////I hope this post doesn't come across as condescending. This is all jus
    | stuff I wish I'd known when I first had kids.////EDIT: I see a few Redditors pointing out that pediatricians are no longer recommendin
    | baby powder. Therefore, strike that and replace it with a good rash cream. I recommend Boudreaux's Butt Paste, which is the best rash 
    |ream I've ever used and is also lots of fun to say. Also, when you bust it out, make sure to tell your spouse/partner "&lt;name of baby
    |gt; has a rash on his/her ash", because saying the same exact joke every single time a given situation arises is a natural part of bein
    | a daddy and you might as well get used to it now.

        | middle of the night for a feeding. I was just wearing pajama pants, no shirt. She took down the bottle like a champ and I put her 
        |n my shoulder to burp her.////Unthinking, I slung her up there like a sack of flour and the second her tummy hit my shoulder, the e
        |tire contents of her stomach poured down my back and into my pajamas. Not one of my better moments.//

        |Actually, I believe they don't reccomend Orajel anymore. It supposedly toughens baby's gums and makes teething more painful. That b
        |ing said, I still used the stuff. Sometimes it was the only way to get through the night. Also, my pediatrician reccomended ibuprof
        |n over acetemeniphen (the active ingeredient in Tylenol). Said it cuts the pain better and he used it with his kids.

        |Great advice! I would add that I've heard from other Dads and my husband that, if the mom is breast feeding, there are times when y
        |u will feel totally helpless during some very tough times for your partner and baby. The best thing is to look for any little way y
        |u can help her (get her water, run to the store for lanolin for her bleeding nipples, keep an ice pack on hand at all times, remind
        |her that she's doing great, make sure she has a TV show or movie on that she likes, hold her when she cries, hold the screaming bab
        | while she goes to the bathroom etc etc etc). You, she, and the baby will get through this!////Note: I'm currently up for a 4am fee

        |Another little piece of advice - if she's three days old as of yesterday or today (eight hours ago is midnight for me) PLEASE DON'T
        |COMBINE HER BIRTHDAY PRESENTS WITH CHRISTMAS!! My birthday is five days after Christmas and I *hate* combined presents. Just don't

        |ght sort of motion. You can get them reasonably cheap second hand, but try to get the matching footstool. ////One final note, hopef
        |lly OP will smell of breast milk instead of formula. Just sayin'. ////Edit: this might be a UK thing, but we've been recommended "m
        |tanium" nappy rash cream and it has worked miracles. teething babies often have watery diarrhoea and it's almost impossible to keep
        |the rash away without some sort of cream.

        |Pediatricians no longer recommend talc-based baby powders because they're dangerous if inhaled.  they say you can use a cornstarch-

        |Hrm... other than having baby Tylenol around I don't need any of these things. (I have a daughter who will be 6 months old on the 4

        |This is incomplete advice but still something to keep in mind... kids version of "sharing" or possession is VERY different from our
        |, and truly, they have to work it out for themselves with only minimal support from you.  The 3.5 yo might be able to accept verbal
        |guidance, like "oh no, shes crying, what can we do to help her feel better?"  or "she has the toy, you want the toy, you look reall
        | upset."   I find that the more parents intervene, the worse the interactions get, because they sense the tension from the parents,
        |and they begin to expect someone to solve these problems FOR them.  I have a 2.5yo, a 5yo, and a 6mo baby here, and I have always t
        |ied to let them test each others boundaries before I step in and enact parent-given boundaries.  I have to really let them test the
        |limits of each other sometimes.  The 5yo really tried to sit on/smack/pull/etc the 2.5yo when he was a baby and she was just 3, and
        |I had to really sit on my hands to see what happened.  Usually the 5yo would drive the baby to tears and be like Oh! It cries.... O
        |ps! Then she would mull it over a few hours and give it another test, with less force.  Anyway maybe its because I started so early
        |with the two of them but they rarely test each others' boundaries now, and know each others' limits pretty well, and are both prett
        | compassionate toward each other.   I'm still working through the 2.5yo with the 6mo old baby!  Its tougher because the 6mo is my n
        |ece, and I take care of her m-f and I can't explain to her mom that I let my toddler smack her in the face in order to let him figu
        |e out things, and that's why shes screaming at full volume. Especially since she doesn't subscribe to any of the "let them have a p
        |riod of working it out themselves" ideas. HEH!  I am definitely finding that all the intervention makes my 2.5yo more nervous and r
        |active like "gosh, they think i'm HURTING her ON PURPOSE! it must be true..." ////

    |Hey new dad, here's some advice from a fellow dad:////Try co-sleeping.////Your doctors will tell you it's bad (they have to, it's the o
    |ficial position of the American Academy of Pediatrics), but all their nurses will tell you it's fine.////Our newborn daughter *would no
    |* sleep by herself.  She was our first, and we did not know what to do.  We tried the "let them cry" thing.  My mom said she did that w
    |th me.  So we would sit on pins and needles while she screamed in her crib in her nursery.  She would go non-stop.  She would literally
    |cry herself sick (throwing up).  We would let her go 15 minutes, and then go calm her down and try again.////This went on for like 2 we
    |ks.  ////The stress level in our house was astronomical.  ////Then one night I picked her up and took her to sit in my recliner chair. 
    |of course she went right to sleep on me.  I got up, and tip-toed to her nursery.  As I went in, I looked at the bed in there (there was
    |an adult bed in this room also for when she got older), and I thought, "Hey, I wonder if I could just lay down here and she would not n
    |tice?"  ////So I laid down and laid my daughter down beside me and we both slept great until the next feeding time.////After that, we p
    |t her in the bed between us.  Since my wife was breast feeding, it was even better for her.  She could just whip out the boobies for ea
    |ing time, doze while the daughter ate, and then when it was all over everyone went back to sleep.  ////Now there is a risk of squashing
    |your kid in bed, which is why doctors do not recommend it.  Personally, if my child moved *at all* in bed I was instantly awake.  And I
    |have read that most of the time when a parent smothers their child drugs or alcohol are a factor.  Obviously if you are stoned you shou
    |dn't be around kids at all let alone sleeping with them.////If you are really concerned, they make these "bed extensions" that slide un
    |er the mattress and make a little "mini-bed" that hangs off the side of your bed that lets you co-sleep with your child but reduces the
    |chance you will squash them.////But I am a big proponent of co-sleeping if you need it.  Now our second child, my son, he didn't need t
    |is at all.  He slept in his own bed right from the start, no problems.////But if you have a clingy baby who only will sleep while being
    |next to a mommy or daddy, co-sleeping might be the thing for you.
