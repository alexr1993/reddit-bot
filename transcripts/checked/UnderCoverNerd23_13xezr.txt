|Similar tricks are used against Raccoons . In a small hole of a log or other trap, stick something shiny. Optional: drive a nail so that th
| tip sticks into the hole at an angle to catch the hand or paw. Raccoon love shiny things and won't let go...Even if they do, the nail catc
|es them.////That you, "Where the Red Fern Grows"

    |Man it was over 10 years ago and I still remember a lot from that book. Good read.

    |I don't know why you were downvoted. What you said is both real and a correct reference.

        |Probably the bit where the nail drives into the raccoon's hands.  //Not everyone sees them as pests in lieu of super cute.////I up-
        |oted anyway, relevant is relevant.

    |TIL that the hole-trick actually works. This is awesome.

    |Interesting story. Of course, it's very unlikely to be true.////• We'd have video of the technique, right? Every outdoorsman/survivor g
    |y who makes a video of squirrel traps would be *all over this* with their cameras if it were true.////• How shiny is a shiny object in 
    | dark hole?

        |I've never done it myself. I grew up out in the desert of Southern California watching Nature unfold in front of me and guided by t
        |e awesome voices of anthropologists like Sir David Attenborough.////|That being said, I am not above hunting. I just don't hunt or 
        |eel the need to use a particularly cruel form of trapping on small animals. Should I ever be starving in the woods or other setting
        |? Yes.////edit about video: No...While there would undoubtedly be videos, I do not think they would last long on youtube. It is con
        |idered to be a very cruel form of trapping. Even in the book I mentioned, the father tells the son that they will NOT do it again. 
        |ou may be thinking about videos of people shooting varmints in Montana (guy uses prairie dogs and other varmints as target practice
        |for high powered rifles). You bring up a good point, but is slightly different in context. Varmints in Montana are dangerous for li
        |estock and people alike.While I don't condone (but have certainly had a giggle or two) the acts portrayed, the death is quick. Thes
        | raccoons suffer and die or amputate their own limbs to get free. Just like bear traps.Do you see many bear trap videos?
