    |I'm kind of jealous he made a tape of himself, I wish I would have done that as a kid.

        |ID: c59v3or, Author: pieguyfry22
        |You can still record yourself now, and then open it again when you're 70 years old. That would be interesting.

        |ID: c59vnl9, Author: thatpaxguy
        |I'm willing to bet that a parent or some adult figure came up with the idea, then wrote down a list of questions and interviewed hi
        | as a child. Still, really awesome.

        |I was 12 in the mid 80's. Living in the Philippines. No video camera. Video technology existed, obviously, back then, but my family
        |never got around to owning any such device until about the time I finished HS. ////I get depressed knowing that there is no motion 
        |apture recording of myself as a kid in existence anywhere. I envy the youth of today.

        |ID: c59znmm, Author: CompanionCubeLovesMe
        |I'm twelve so I still have a chance. Yet I'm too lazy to do any of that. Plus, I'm fairly certain I'll be dead within the next 6 ye
        |rs.

    |ID: c59txqh, Author: biplaneblues
    |I'm really impressed with his 12 year old self's creativity... This guy made the [Jazz Dispute](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsBC5C5E
    |ho), one of my all time favs.

        |ID: c59vmhg, Author: godsdead
        |Im more impressed with the editing job and creating dialogue around the garbage his 12 year old self would have said, I bet you won
        | see him uploading the source of the 20 year old video! 

        |ID: c59v0ww, Author: MoonDaddy
        |I guess what was weirdest for me was when I clicked on this 12 year old self video and paused my music, only to hear the same Charl
        |e Parker song keep going.  I checked my music, and sure enough, it was paused-- dude had put the exact same song into his video!///

        |At 12, all I was thinking about was the motherfucking power rangers.

        |Priceless when he gave himself that look when he said gettin older get down, hahaha love it.

        |This isn't actually true, or? Isn't this just a "scenario"? 

        |ID: c59wled, Author: DELETED
        |Hadn't seen it before, but that video (Jazz Dispute) is pretty awesome.////What I was thinking the whole time: I wonder what I'd th
        |nk if I could read lips. 

        |ID: c59wsxa, Author: zillah1985
        |Holy crap. When people tell me they don't understand Jazz, I will show them that video.

        |I will never be able to listen to jazz in the same way again.

        |He also did [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlkdtS8OFlA&amp;feature=relmfu), which I love.

        |It could easily be his son/nephew. Not to sound too cynical about it, it's still a cool idea.

    |ID: c59uk81, Author: Koshesha
    |This covered a surprisingly wide range of emotion. Great idea and well executed. 

        |ID: c5a0txj, Author: mayonegg90
        |The very subtle zoom together with the facial expression and silence when Roy is revealed. I hope this man is living comfortably wi
        |h his skills and talents.

        |ID: c5a0oga, Author: ImBeingSeriousHere
        |Yeah!  I was expecting sappy music and a sob story of how he didn't live up to his 12-year-old ambitions, like those guys who wante
        | us to pay them for a trip to Iceland to do the same thing with a TV.  That one kind of pissed me off.////Instead we get this guy a
        |ting like it ain't a thang.  

    |ID: c59txmg, Author: Jezzamuppet
    |Absolutely love it, but want to do it now. Don't have 20 years patience :(

        |It became depressing at the point in the video where it was planned to become depressing?  Thanks for informing us.

    |ID: c59ueyz, Author: rizwan_k
    |That was awesome, the fact that his 12 year old self managed to articulate so well and make his dialogue so natural, it was amazing. 

        |ID: c59umzu, Author: DELETED
        |Not to detract from the amazing creativity on his part, but I assume that there was a great deal of editing involved to make that i
        |teraction appear fluid.  

        |ID: c59vlia, Author: godsdead
        |Its called Editing.

    |ID: c59txb4, Author: TeddyGNOP
    |Had me laughing from the second the dialogue started.  ////&gt;You look different!////&gt;No shit?

    |That was pretty clever!////"It's literally the same action figure"

        |ID: c59uss4, Author: crazycriv
        |My favorite was when the kid whispered "God I have to shit, remember this feeling" while the grown up self was talking. It's very s
        |btle, which made it a lot more fun to catch.

        |I watched Jurassic park w my room mate the other day, he's 20 and a little off sometimes. I only had a VHS copy of the film so I bu

        |ID: c59v5os, Author: TheBombadillo
        |Teacher here. Schools most definitely DO have a permanent record but.. unless it's like some sort of heinous crime, it's gonna matt
        |r for jack shit as soon as you leave school. So don't worry about all those detentions.

        |Assuming this is me when I first turned 12, here's what I would tell me. Not all the [redacteds] are the same person.////Don't date
        |[redacted] in high school. Mess around with her as much as you can for as long as you can, but never date her. She won't kill herse
        |f, that's a lie made to keep you and it's just a time waster. She's psychotic.////When the time comes, [redacted] and [redacted] ca
        | be talked in to a threesome. This is the one chance you had in life to pull that off and you didn't see it because you dated [reda
        |ted] instead. Don't be an idiot. ////When you dump [redacted] because she's too immature, you're making a mistake. Girl is a wildca
        |. Stay with her another few months and go as far as you can as often as you can (seriously trust me). She will leave you in four mo
        |ths because of another event in her life that ends with her being a stripper with a five year old at 24 years old. This is not your
        |fault, but you might as well take a larger bite of that dessert before tragedy strikes.////[redacted]'s older sister can be talked 
        |n to more that day but you were too happy with what had happened. Do not lose focus. Same goes for *the first*. You'll know what I'
        | talking about when you're 14 and on park avenue.////Invest in Apple////Buy gold////Study harder or college you is going to be *pis
        |ed*. ////In half a year you're going to see someone treating someone else in a bad way. Beat him half to death and you will earn th

    |People are giving the 12 year old to much credit, The older self should get the majority of the credit. Suurrrreeeee the 12 year old se
    |f thought of this idea and subsequently created it, but the older self brought it to light and put in the brain power to make it a watc
    |able and somewhat moving dialog that is actually believable...... Upvote for the older self!!!! 

        |ID: c59xexz, Author: davebees
        |I caught myself wondering which of them deserved more credit. Then I realised it was the same guy.

        |Are you insane? Yes, yes you are.

        |ID: c5a5ii3, Author: crazykoala
        |Yes, exactly. He did an amazing editing job to make those 12 year old bits appear conversational and real.

        |ID: c59ysci, Author: witchcountry
        |The content was amazing and him as a 12 year old did a great job. But he should have hired an actor to play the present day version
        |of himself. He was stiff, but in the end, the content got through, so yeah. ////But it's a perfect demonstration of how lacking in 
        |elf-consciousness kids are. They are all little DeNiro's. You can see, back to back, all the psychological torment that's been pile
        | on over the years. Something happened and now this guy can't act! He learned to act in his real life, like all adults, and now he 
        |an't act in fiction! Trippy shit g!

    |ID: c59ugxt, Author: TheMrNashville
    |That was so well done it makes me question if he actually made that video when he was 12. If he did that is pure genius and dedication.

        |ID: c59vw8d, Author: DELETED
        |What did he write for the stuff about the Internet and the relevant Doctor Who quote?////*\&lt;insert relevant and humorous futuris

    |Dear 12 year old me:////1. Girls aren't worth it, stop stressing about dating//2. Stay away from a certain Indian girl. You will very s
    |ortly lose your virginity to her after dating for a couple weeks. Good show, but you'll be miserable after she dumps you//3. If you ign
    |red step #2, don't be miserable. She has a major Electra complex. Please notice how she points to guys with grey hair and leathery skin
    |and finds them attractive.//4. if you ignored step #3, for the love of Dao (you'll understand this later), stay away from that whore do
    |n the street//5. If you ignored step #4 like I did, then I can't blame you for ignoring her for the rest of eternity like I did. Just d
    |n't be a huge asshole to her when she shows up at your house//6. Okay, I can't blame you for being a huge asshole to her. She's fucking
    |insane, but don't call the cops when she sits down on your front doorstep and won't leave//7. Alright, you were in your legal rights to
    |do so, it's not your fault that the police had to be involved.//////Dear future me:////1. Girls aren't worth it

    |Just watched again - so good.////&gt; well the answer is, they're all dead.////

    |ID: c59v6gm, Author: NPHisKing
    |I love how he clearly knows what he wants to say and how to react on some parts (doctor who, star wars figurine) and how he knew that s
    |me pieces were going to be written in the future (internet). Genius scripting/editing.

    |ID: c59vdky, Author: AdamLynch
    |ChurchOfBlow? Good memories. Always thought he just quit YouTube, nice to know he has a new channel.

        |ID: c59vjtw, Author: DimlightHero
        |Those video's are classics

    |"Stardust" was a nice touch. Very clever

    |ID: c59v7qy, Author: Saint-Baconator
    |"Don't blink, blink and you're dead" had me laughing for a while. Great reference to Doctor Who.

    |ID: c59ukq4, Author: DELETED
    |What would have taken the cake is if he suddenly went off screen and appeared in his previous video as his current self. Then slaps his
    |former self.

    |This is so fluid! How does a 12 year kid think of such things to say?! 

        |ID: c59vv0d, Author: ObeseSnake
        |Most 12 year olds I play online games with have LOTS of things to say.

        |ID: c59wbje, Author: H1_Gipan_Baban
        |ramble on and smartly edit later. It's like ... making movies. Or something.

    |ID: c59vwd9, Author: KidShowtime
    |This is one of the most creative ideas ever. I was sad that it was so short.. I just wanted it to go on!//

    |ID: c59xtvy, Author: raymendx
    |That was excellent. From the beginning I thought this guy should be an actor or a pro in film making. He should be making big movies no
