    |Well this is ridiculously awesome

        |ID: caeg8pv, Author: catdogs_boner
        |Yeah it's an awesome wolf, but can it clean pipes?

        |ID: caegifx, Author: DividedAttention
        |Took me a few seconds to understand what I was looking at, this is outstanding.

        |Oh, it's a wolf made of pipe cleaners? I thought it just had a really bad haircut.

        |ID: caeimv9, Author: worldalpha_com
        |Wow, it took me a few seconds to figure out if it was a wolf made out of pipe cleaners, or a wolf named Pipe Cleaner because of how
        |it looked.  That's great.

        |There's a link on [Make](http://blog.makezine.com/craft/animal-sculptures-from-pipe-cleaners/) link with some good pictures of a wo

        |This is ridiculously ridiculously good looking, maybe even a Magnum

    |At first, I thought it was a real wolf and it was a wolf puppy that specializes on cleaning pipes.////I am not a smart man.

        |ID: caefdt8, Author: Sitin
        |This was my first thought, then I thought it may be a breed that is named after its pipecleaner like fur.

        |ID: caegxbs, Author: purple_sage2
        |Don't feel bad. *I* had to Google, "Pipe Cleaner Wolf" to see if it was real. I am not a smart woman. 

        |ID: caegeqa, Author: georgerob
        |haha you fool! but seriously how can OP prove this living wolf cleans pipes?

        |ID: caeh0zm, Author: AP_YI_OP
        |First thing I thought: "Awww, poor thing's fur is all matted!"

        |ID: caeh587, Author: falconbox
        |me too.  i was thinking "damn, that is one ugly looking wolf.  and what the hell is wrong with it's tail?"

        |ID: caei2j6, Author: 50_shades_of_winning
        |I thought the same thing. I don't understand how the eyes looks so realistic.

        |ID: cael9yb, Author: Salvboss
        |I'm glad I'm not the only one

    |ID: caeesm8, Author: network39
    |At first glance I actually thought that was a real dog!

        |ID: caefxjj, Author: Sport6
        |Yeah I thought it was a real dog that had his fur frozen in spots.

        |ID: caefv9r, Author: SaltTM
        |yeah lol I was like "this dog is about to mess someone up for sticking him up the chimney" then realized it wasn't real and it blew
        |my mind.

        |ID: caeg66v, Author: ADubs62
        |Until I read this comment I thought it was a real dog.

        |ID: caefvjx, Author: newguy57
        |"Why would someone cover a pet in pipe cleaners!"

        |ID: caefw0v, Author: mb1107
        |Wait..////That's not a real dog ?////Edit: Ah, it's Russia

        |ID: caeg72r, Author: TheDataWhore
        |It still looks like it could be real after knowing it's not.

        |ID: caegcjo, Author: HoldenCaulfield7
        |Same. I was like, "Damn, that wolf got a bad hair cut." Then I put my glasses on... 

        |ID: caefxgb, Author: Antrikshy
        |I only realized after reading your comment.

        |ID: caeg7a4, Author: Hara-Kiri
        |Yeah, me too. I read the title, thought it sounded interesting, glanced at the picture and thought, 'Oh, it's just a normal wolf, t
        |at was disappointing'. It's really impressive actually. 

        |ID: caegmb9, Author: megustadotjpg
        |Had to go to the comments to see what this new breed of dog was about. I'm stupid.

        |ID: caehtuq, Author: Gengi
        |IKR, From the thumb I was wondering why a wolf was cleaning pipes.

        |ID: caejz0i, Author: coonskinmario
        |I thought it was a badly shaved dog, since its fur looks like my cats' does when they struggle too much getting shaved.

        |ID: ccwwvsc, Author: Mr_Brian
        |I read this and I thought, "Oh is it an actual wolf?". And then I kept reading and realized it is neither. It is in fact pipe clean
        |rs.

        |ID: caeg9dg, Author: ApplesFromKira
        |Nope.

        |ID: caeg5nu, Author: bandwagoner
        |Well, it was supposed to be a wolf apparently. Guess they need some more practice.

        |ID: caeiu4f, Author: cupcakegiraffe
        |I was about to say that most of it was amazingly beautiful with exception of the hind foot.  I did also tell myself, though, that i
        | was most likely a work in progress.  Thank you for the link, those pipe cleaner animals are phenomenal!

    |Holy shit, from the thumbnail, I figured the heading was just to refer to the fluffiness of a real wolf. That's freaking awesome! 

        |ID: caefm82, Author: confused-koala
        |I thought the same exact thing.  And that's what I STILL thought when I looked at it at first.

    |This looked so real, for a second I couldn't figure out what as wrong with the fur. And then the realization hit that it was a wolf cre
    |ted out of pipe cleaners. Very impressive!

    |Amazingly good job.  It took me more than three seconds to realize that wasn't a wolf.  A mistake like that in the wild could have cost
    |me a jugular.

    |Why did I expect a real wolf using his tail to accidently clean an exhaust pipe?

    |ID: caegpir, Author: Corrupt_T
    |My first thought was, oh that poor wolf, look at all that matted fur.////Then my braincell turned on.////I am not a smart man.

    |ID: caegq8a, Author: FTLOG

    |ID: caegto6, Author: Souuuth
    |To me, it seriously looks just a tad bit real. Especially if you look at it fast.

    |ID: caegv5t, Author: TheRiceRoket
    |Initial reaction "heheh, that wolf does look like it is covered in pipe cleaners."////Then I realized the scale with the person's body

    |ID: caegxns, Author: eyeheartboobs
    |I didn't read the title before I clicked on it. I looked at it for about .6 seconds and thought "cool picture of a wolf", but I now rea
    |ize that I should have said "really cool picture of some pipe cleaners"

    |You should *probably* cut those nails, OP.

    |ID: caegy8j, Author: ms_bonezy
    |I thought it was a real wolf pup that was really fuzzy... Then I remembered that I am slightly inebriated. Still awesome though .
