    |Dangit. Why does the stuff I *want* to magnify only zoom in a tiny bit, but spiders and /r/popping always zoom in to the po
    |e level?

            |I know it's a potato, but it made me nostalgia hard when I thought the thumbnail was the robot from flubber.


                |That movie was the shit. I must have seen it at least 20 times.


                    |I think movies from my childhood were the shit too.


                    |&gt;That movie was shit. 


                |NOSTALGIAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!////Adorable floating robot voiced by Jodi FUCKING Benson!? Yes!


                |Or the robot from MST3K


            |Risky click.////


                |It's just a potato!

        |hey michael bolton.


        |I would also like to ogle them.


        |Why the fuck do you zoom in on popping posts you sick faggot. Why would you even go there in the first place?


            |fail trole. upvoted


    |Terrible form on that kick lol :P


        |I know right? They are in Japan, like 97% of Japanese people know how to kick better than this. 


            |Yeah, ikr? Last time I went there I got in a bar fight, kung fu everywhere. Luckily someone drew road lines on the 
            |loor so they weren't able to follow me out the door without cutting each other off.


                |Kung Fu is Chinese. 


            |No need to be racist, i_madethistosay_this.  Next thing you know *everyone* is Jackie Chan...


                |Jackie Chan is chinese...


        |OP, keep the top of your foot straight, raise thigh then extend leg, turn body with kick. Your planted foot is fine.///

            |Ohhh that kind of Black guy...


            |At what belt do they teach you the second kick?


    |Fighting to the death with Jesus cleats on? Liu Kang would be ashamed.


        |Did you just call flip-flops Jesus cleats? Because that is hilarious


        |Enter the Blood Code!- Mom is not looking right now!


    |Big ups to that patch of greenery on the right side////Surviving against all odds


        |Hydroponics, yo.


        |Reminds me of billnyetho


    |Finish him! 


        |I and a 1000 other people were gonna say that 


            |I came here to say,"If you came here to say it, then just upvote it and continue on." ////But I'm not an asshole, s
            | carry on.


        |Fatality!


        |M-m-m-m-m-m-multi kill ^kill^kill^kill


    |**TOASTY**


    |That looks like a giant tree stump. Really cool looking stage though.


        |It is a tree stump. Those are just tiny people.


        |Looks like that one tree stump at [Big Trees, CA](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/6
        |25/1372174941410/Leo-blog-on-mammoth-tree--008.jpg).


            |By the time we got to California, we had exhausted all creative placenames. 


    |Looks like a pic from the mas oyama book "this is karate" 


    |Looks like where Aang beat the Firelord.


    |[Columnar basalt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt#Columnar_basalt), also found at [The Giant's Causeway](http://en.wiki
    |edia.org/wiki/Giant's_Causeway) and [Fingal's Cave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingal's_Cave).


    |[Mortal Kombat Theme ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAwWPadFsOA 'MORTAL KOMBAAATTT!!!')////Because I know everybody wants
    |to listen to it.


    |Initially I believed this was the remains of a large tree, but upon closer inspection, I concluded it is a rock formation./
    |//I like to think of it as a tree.////It seems more amazing that way. 


        |Looks like the mysterious pyramid formations off the lower coast of Japan. 


        |precious postulation, pal.


        |It definitely looks like petrified wood.


    |White people.


    |TEST YOUR FUCKING MIGHT


    |"Ring Out!" would work perfectly thereâ€¦


    |Can we get someone from /r/shittyphotoshop on this?


    |Let it dry.


    |As soon as I saw this the music from that terrible terrible movie popped into my head.... Now I just watch it. 


    |You guys are going to get sick from radiation poisoning.  Have the nosebleeds started?


    |does this remind anyone of spongebob's karate island? KARATE


    |Didn't exactly land that kick did he....


    |Somebody's back is about to break. Probably the one in black.


    |Did you at least "FINISH HIM" 


    |this looks like where sasuke and kakashi trained during the chuunin exam.


    |How did U get up there


    |Look at the power in that kick!


    |Toasty 


    |Basalt columns////http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt


    |There should be a caption saying, "Get over here!".


    |They can't both pick Johnny Cage!


    |**FIGHT!** 


    |Looks more like soul caliber 


    |Liu Kang vs Johnny Cage


    |WHOOPSIE!


    |More like pokemon training ground! I totally remember this stage from Pokemon Stadium.


    |Finish him


    |Unless I'm mistaken, this is Tojinbo in Fukui Prefecture. Locals just call it the Suicide Cliffs for obvious reasons. There
    |s an ex cop who volunteers by walking around occasionally and telling people not to off themselves. It's also much much big
    |er than the picture lets on, and beautiful. Source: I live nearby.////http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Djinb%C5%8D


    |Radioactive water beneath, ring out is deadly indeed


    |We'll they don't have to go far to test their might breaking rock. 


    |Where's the acid ?


    |Looks more like the guy on the right is protecting his organically grown weed stash from his doppelganger from the future..
    |.or something


    |That would be a great filming location.


    |Da Da da da DA Da Da Da da da DA da MORTAL KOMBAT!!!

    |Instantly upon reading the title, the mortal kombat [theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAwWPadFsOA) popped into m
    | head.


    |Two Johnny Cages!


    |Is it weird that the first thing that came to mind was "that looks like a place were sacrifices were performed"?
