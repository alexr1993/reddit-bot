The ‘Archer’ Team Archerized The ‘Danger Zone’ Music Video From ‘Top Gun’ And It’s Perfect(/r/Videos)




    |The level of detail is so good...  witness Archer's flight patch with Babou on it and Barry's handle, "Other Barry"


        |Their art staff is phenomenal.


            |I would kill for a third-or-first-person shooter Archer, ala N.O.L.F.


                |Oh, NOLF, we miss you.


                    |I am re-installing it as we speak. I MUST PLAY AGAIN!


                |I think Archer would be better suited for something like Telltale's games, Archer is all about character intera
                |tion for its humour, and it's already got an art style very much in tune with Telltale games.


                    |Nope. Give it to Obsidian and let them do an Alpha Protocol thing. I was thinking about how amazing that wo
                    |ld be. Having the Mass Effect-type responses, but they're all being an asshole. Having huge briefings about
                    |this really important mission, and then it ends up that the only objective the player is given is "Get Lana
                    |naked." Slowly getting tinnitus over the course of the game.


                        |I would unironically buy this game. 


                            |A minigame where you have to figure out how the hell you managed to shoot Brett when you shot your 
                            |un in the office. Dialogue interruption cues to shout "LANA!"////A Danger Zone meter. Filling the m
                            |ter does nothing, but it's there.


                                |No no, filling the meter unlocks rampage mode!


                        |Momp. Momp. Momp.


                        |I want to see an Adventure Island type of Archer game [think Ben there Dan that]. That style of storyte
                        |ling and gaming has been dead, but is still very fun.


                        |To be fair if you play Alpha Protocol picking flirty/assholey actions and dialog choices main character
                        |will feel a lot like Archer.


                        |Money. How do I give you money to make this real?


                        |god alpha protocol was so bad, it felt like playing an alpha build, not even ready for beta yet


                    |A tongue-in-cheek shooter might work. **XIII** the game already pulled of an art-style very similar to Arch
                    |r and was a shooter - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XIII_(video_game)


                |Or XIII////Yeah, a good cell-shaded Archer FPS... I'd jump its bones so hard it'd have to jump back.


                |Gah!  I had forgotten that NOLF's protagonist was also named Archer-- it works almost too well.


                |XIII?


                |My god.


                |Or a snarky Goldeneye


                |I'd kill, and then get people to do killing for me to have that as a thing. But if they screwed it up, I'd prob
                |bly be quite annoyed. 


                |NOLF with the art style of xiii pretty much


                |XIII is pretty similar in artstyle, and it's pretty damn fun


                |Or *XIII*.

            |The phenomenal art is why they can't make episodes  faster.


        |also, when ray gets coffee spilled on him, all I could think was him saying "dukes!"....and then it happened again...do
        |ble dukes!


            |By Brett too!!


            |In the top gun scene, that character says "I want some butts!"////Thats probably why they used Ray..


            |"Hard deck my ass, we nailed that son of a bitch!"////PHRASING


            |Negative Ghostrider. The pattern is full.


        |Yeah, that whole video seemed spot on. They did a good job merging the characters - Lana does look a lot like Kelly McG
        |llis and Pam like a more rotund Meg Ryan. 


            |Holy shit! I saw it in the cinema, I've seen it a couple of times on TV... [HOW DID I NOT NOTICE THIS? MEG RYAN IS 
            |OOSE'S WIFE.](http://i.imgur.com/RhEXUqR.jpg)////My life is a lie.


                |Here's another one: [Tim Robbins (*Shawshank Redemption*) is Merlin](http://images.wikia.com/topgun/images/9/9d
                |Merlin.jpg), Cougar's RIO in the first scene and Mav's after Goose dies (you know... the guy from *E.R.* :)). I
                |think you only see his eyes the whole movie because he's always wearing the pilot mask in his scenes.


                    |Its actually Bill Paxton in the first couple of scenes (you can really tell when he says "mav we've got a p
                    |oblem here that Mig realy screwed him up"), but then was replaced during filming by robbins.  He was uncred
                    |ted for his scenes


                        |Oh, awesome! I recognized Robbins' eyes/forehead, but it never sounded like him so it was always weird.
                        |Definitely sounds like Bill Paxton, too.


                        |Just watched that scene, that's insane. Totally Paxton, especially how he says "up" with that drawl of 
                        |is. I wonder why they didn't just leave Paxton in the film?


                        |*glass shatters*


                    |There's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it [shot](http://bluraymedia.ign.com/bluray/image/article/975/975207/topgun

                    |Ffffffffffffff...


                    |A bit more obscure, Rick Rossovich is Iceman's RIO - Rick played the meat-headed Chris in Steve Martin's "R
                    |xanne," and was also a victim of the original Terminator.


                    |This is hilarious because Tim Robbins in 6'4" and would never fit in one of those jets.


                    |Yeah when I watched it again recently I'm like...is that fucking Tim Robbins? Lemme imdb this shit... Sure 
                    |uff!


                        |He's listed in the title credits.


                        |I love imdb for shit like this...that person looks like this other person I saw in this other movie tha

                        |Are you guys both literally retarded?////What's next, Val Kilmer was Iceman?


                            |or that two of the pilots at TOP GUN had asses as the symbol on their helmets


                            |Yes, I'm retarded for not recognizing a fairly famous actor in a small role in a movie I watched as

                                |Confuscious say; if you see a hypocrite, call him retard once more!

                            |Wow really? I'll have to re watch that now!


                    |Huh. Well I'll be damned. I've seen top gun hundreds of times (seriously) and NEVER noticed that


                    |"You're gonna do what?!"


                    |From the Navy to prison. Tim Robbins must like taking long showers with other men in the wee hours of the m

                    |That's actually my second favorite incognito appearance by Tim Robbins.  My favorite will always be him in

                    |You see him unmasked at the end when they're celebrating on the carrier flight deck


                    |his most prominent appearance is at the end when everyone is celebrating after Mavrick lands.


                |If you didn't realize that, you may want to brush up your Kevin Bacon Game skills. I worked at a video rental p
                |ace for a couple years and it was the best way to pass the time that didn't involve actual work.

                        |Filthy heathens. And what's worse, it trimmed a step off my two-movie chain to Pauly Shore that I was s
                        | proud of. 


                    |That or any thing not involving retarded customers. I too have witnessed the horrors that is a video store.

                        |Most customers were cool, but some of them... Holy fuck. 


                            |One time I had bright pink hair and some one asked if it was my natural hair color. Either they wer
                            | the best dead pan comedian in the universe or they were serious. I'd bet on the latter.


                                |I forget the movie, but generic airplane based thriller which had something like "A WILD RIDE!"
                                | on the poster (obviously a quote from a movie review). ////"Hey, do you have "A Wild Ride" in?

                                    |It got to be a sixth sense whenever any one asked "Hey, you have that one movie with that g
                                    |y in it?" and I would guess it within two or three tries for older movies and always knew t

                    |I'm pretty good at this game.  I love it.////No one likes playing with me though. :C////They usually just l
                    |st two actors to see how fast I can link them.  More fun for them I guess.


                        |I like adding an intermediary actor to make it more fun for me. Having worked in a video store in the d
                        |ys before imdb, I have an unfair advantage over most people. 


                |And did you notice how Goose is played by Bashar Al-assad in that photo?


                    |topical. nice.


                        |I'd like to think Archer would be pleased.


                |Notice what?? That Pam looks like Meg Ryan?


                    |No, Meg Ryan was in the film Top Gun. I never made the connection until I read it just now.


                        |Credits are tricky. 


                |It's OK. I've seen Top Gun more than a dozen times, and I was a huge ER fan and watched for years before I real

                    |Yeah, he's so [cool](http://i.imgur.com/ml74Mlv.jpg).


                |I grew up in the 80s and Top Gun was watched at every birthday party and sleepover. I am almost 40 years old an
                | have never noticed until this very day that Meg Ryan was in Top Gun. ////So don't feel bad :)


                    |I grew up in the 90's, I got yelled at by my mom when we had it cranked up way too loud during one sleepove

                        |That's seriously awesome! You should have him over for a sleepover at your mom's someday and crank that
                        |movie just to piss her off. Or get him to buzz her house and see if that's loud enough :)


                            |He's only stationed a state and a half away, which in an F-18 is probably about a 20 minute flight.

                                |And 45 minutes of air refueling.


                    |I'm sorry but I'm 32 and TG was released when I was probably around 7, and I know that Meg Ryan was goose's

                        |I probably knew it at some point, but I haven't really sat down and watched it in probably 20 years so

        |I can't find the information now, but I remember seeing or hearing that it takes about two weeks for them to do the art
        |ork for just one episode because of the amount of detail they put into their work.  They even have a costume designer t
        |at makes clothing from the appropriate time period, a model then wears the clothes and the artists then draws based off
        |the model.  ////


            |&gt; Appropriate time period////what year do you think this is?//


                |Well the clothing styles are all from the 50's and 60's mainly, so about then I'm guessing?


                    |its a running gag in the show kinda, the conflicts are mainly cold era stuff but then the gadgetry and othe
                    | references to the modern era are thrown in, making it not set it in any real period of time. prompting arc
                    |er to wonder aloud a couple times what year is. pretty funny imo


                    |clothing is from that period but there's a lot of modern stuff so you really can't say when it is


                        |I think the two of you are conflating the time period of the show and the time period of the clothing s
                        |yles within the show.  ////i.e. Set in 2010 with 50s era stylistic cues. 


                            |It isn't set in 2010, because the Soviet Union still exists.////It's a running gag in the show that
                            |no one knows exactly what year it is.

                        |Fair enough.  


                        |Case in point: cell phones.


                |Based on the styles, and the fact that the Soviet Union still exists, I'd guess the 1960's, but they never actu

                    |I'd say 70s since Archer drives a 1970 Dodge Challenger


                |They did a behind-the-scenes video showing how they did the historical episode where his valet (Woodhouse) was 
                |n WWI and served as batman to a pilot. They designed and sewed period costumes and photographed models, then di

            |Which time period? Postpremoderncoldwarfuture?


                |Lol yes.  But the clothing styles are 50's 


                    |Lana's dresses are from the '60s, though.  You can't easily stick it into a single decade.


            |If so that is incredible. The show is fantastic and so I wouldn't be surprised if that is what they actually do som

            |Goddamn, there's even a portrait behind Mallory of Duchess (the dog) in uniform.


        |I'd definitely pay for one of those Babou patches. 


        |The notation of the guitar playing is accurate to a T too. 


        |His flight helmet also said Duchess on it, haha.


        |His helmet says Duchess, too.

        |And Cyril's callsign is Fig-Goose////hehe


        |I bet they draw some stuff over stills from the movie.


        |Pretty great, but too short. I mean, can you imagine if they re-did the whole movie, *Archer*-style!?!////I know that w

        |even nailed the weird [throwing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWLFD0EupvI) style!


        |Malory has a picture of Duchess (the dog) hanging in her office.


        |Archer's handle is Duchess...


        |Yes, Other Barry, IT IS!


    |Krieger singing and playing the guitar made that video so much better


        |The "bite" from Barry is what got me.

                |His patch at the beginning is "Babou" the ocelot.


                |I didn't even catch that - brilliant!


            |Yeah that was like the perfect weird/funny moment from the movie to bust out

            |Me too. He has a sinister Iceman thing going, so it seemed appropriate.

    | points, they even make a point to cycle the slide after removing a magazine to get rid of the cartridge in the chamber. Yo
    | can even see how much more detailed the show became over the series, with his PPK going from [this](http://www.imfdb.org/i

        |I know a couple of background artists on the show.////Everyone involved is 100% committed and it is apparent.


            |Except for Dave. He's only 89% committed.


        |I honestly never noticed the gun details but now I don't think I'll be able to ignore them.  Good catch!


        |Thats because every episode is actually created in 3D before being drawn. Check the making of videos!


        |I read your comment before I clicked the link and thought you meant "drawing guns properly" as in removing a weapon fro

        |Many shows are that way.  Look at an old simpsons and a newer one.


        |Also, detail about alcohol and cocktail recipes.  Always spot on.


        |Damn that second PPK is legit. Although I think it looks like the hammer is full-down instead of resting on the safety.


        |I have a LOT of favorite parts to the show.  The animation standards being high is just one.  ////The chemistry the voi
        |e talent produces is just amazing.  The script on paper would probably look dubious, at best.  Well, like 50% meaningfu

        |he story arcs, the character design... every one of these characters is fantastically intensified charicatures of someo
        |e we know, but without going into madcap flailing-arms crazy territory.  It's often sublime in how subtle and dry the h
        |gh-impact stuff is here.////"Press the red button."////"ok... wait, is this gonna kill everyone?"////"Press the blue bu

        |on, emphasis, "reaction shots"... but no they just delivered in a dry, minimal, zero-buildup, zero-followup and it's so
        |fabulous for it.


    |haha that was fantastic, would love to see a full length Archer movie. It could/would work so well!! 


        |I'd prefer more episodes. A lot of comedy series lose their comedic edge when put into movie format because a movie has
        |to be more "serious" and needs to tell a story, which limits the possibility of dicking around and going for random ins
        |de jokes which Arches uses heavily.


            |I don't know. The Aqua Teens Hunger Force Movie pulled it off pretty well. It was essentially just a long ass ATHF 
            |pisode. Didnt lose any of the humor. It's just a matter of having writers, having a studio that will fund a full fe
            |ture movie, and an audience that will go see it.


                |The movie was good but if I remember correctly it wasn't much of a success 


                |I remember being so high when I saw that movie that I couldn't tell you the plot immediately after leaving the 
                |heater.////but maybe that was the point.


                |the first 30 min was ok, the rest was trash


            |Family Guy had some excellent full length productions-- it can be done.  ////*it can be done.*


                |Isn't Star Wars the longest thing they've done? ////I'm pretty sure those are all only an hour long, that's not
                |really "full-length", some tv shows are that long every episode 


                    |The straight-to-DVD movie they did was close to 90 minutes.


                        |Yeah, but that was essentially 3 episodes with filler in the beginning.


        |What makes archer so good is that it is so much content delivered in a tight package. ////Plus I don't know how many se
        |sons Adam Reed has got left in him... Season 4 was... ok but no where near as good as previous seasons. ////Edit: inste

        |already there saying the same thing? 


            |&gt; What makes archer so good is that it is so much content delivered in a tight package.////Exactly. If they kept
            |that pace in a full length movie, my head would probably explode halfway through.

                |All of season's 1 through 2 + the Heart of Archness special, were solid.


            |I don't know, I've enjoyed the hell out of it myself.  But to each their own.


                |Indeed.  I feel like the show really became "comfortable" with itself on Season 4.  Reliably funny, reliably ne
                | and interesting plots, and the art is ever-improving.////Plus it had Kazak.  You can't go wrong with Kazak.


                    |Bastard Chef &amp; Kazak are up there in my top favorite episodes.////People just hate on the new seasons b

                        |I don't see how trends have anything to do with it, the recent episodes really were pretty bad.


                    |Does Kazak appear in more episodes? That is as far as I've seen but I loved his and Archer's back and forth
                    |throughout and I just want more Kazak.


                |I thought season 4 was pretty awesome....


            |All the greatness of S4 was packed into *Un Chien Tangerine*.


                |So you are saying the season had one good episode


                    |I'm saying it had one *great* episode.


                        |but that is the problem, most episodes in seasons 1+2 and about half in season 3 are great episodes

            |I agree that Season 4 wasn't as good as the first ones. Just watched all of them for the first time and I didn't li
            |e 3 or 4 as much as 1 and 2, but I think it still has the same kind of comedy and keeps it style, without overdoing

                |I actually think I prefer season 4 to 3. But I do think 2 is the best so far.


                    |Honestly Season 3 might be my favorite. The arc wasn't as good, but The Limited, Lo Scandalo, and Drift Pro

                |Agreed!  3 was okay but I told myself if 4 didn't start strong I was going to drop it.  Really didn't care for

            |They had already made most of the episode, I'm guessing the program they use has levels and they just deleted the a

    |January?!?!


        |And the season always goes by so fast. Goddamned cable TV schedules.


        |Yes, that is typical for the American market. The show run is half season (10-13 episodes).////The only reason there we

            |I was shocked to see an Australian series (Master Chef - Australia) with over 70 episodes.  Just for a single seaso
            |.////


                |reality tv is so easy to churn out tons of episodes for extremely cheap.  Scripted shows have a lot of overhead
                | animated ones more so.


                |Mastrchef Australia is great, but it's on for 3 months, 6 days a week. It adds up.


                    |I'm totally addicted to it.  It's so refreshing watching reality TV where people aren't all Jersey-shore wi
                    |h each other.   


                        |Try watching Face-Off. It's a competition show for movie make-up artists, like creature designers and s
                        |uff. Everyone on that show is so insanely nice to each other. There's almost no drama between the conte

                        |y right, it's incredibly refreshing.

                            |Thank you. I have correct what I wanted to say.


                |British TV seems to be the opposite, as someone relatively new to it, to see seasons that end after 5 episodes 
                |ometimes.


            |"Half season" man, being British is awful, our seasons are usually 6 episodes or so (Sherlock gets 3, but each epis
            |de is 90 minutes), so we get like quarter seasons.


                |For Brits, half season is usually 6, full season (if production is lucky) is 10-13. I download a lot of Brit sh
                |ws, so I'm used to it. It might be limited, but I always knows those episodes are going to be jam packed with a
                |esome-sauce, so I prefer that set up.////With America, a full season is 24-ish. The starting few epis and the s
                |ason finale are usually great... the rest of the episodes are filler and very boring (use 'House' as an example
                |. They even do flash-back / summary episodes!////The only reason I can think of to justify the difference is ad
                |ertising. Networks want more money, so they need more episodes for advertisers to show products. The UK must ha

                    |&gt; With America, a full season is 24-ish////Depends on broadcast or cable. A lot (the majority/nearly all
                    |) of cable shows are also 10-13 episodes per season.


                        |Yea true. As always, depends on the network.


            |Typical for the American CABLE market.  Network scripted shows usually run 22-24 episodes.  Reality shows run 13-15
            |(some that run several nights a week have more).////It's better than the UK though, were many series are 6-8 episod
            |s long.


        |Yea, what a tease. I expected something like next week after that promo. :(

                |epic. And I hate that word.////Kudos to everyone involved on the show.


            |The backgrounds are done in 3dsmax, but all of the animation is done in After Effects if I remember correctly!


                |Kind of, but mostly not. We get base 3d renders for backgrounds but then a team of people go in and hand paint,
                |texture, light, and outline the whole thing in photoshop. its no easy gig!


        |Animation is a technology - it tends not to go backwards.


            |Sure, though in this case the animation of the pilot wasn't necessarily due to technology. I'd bet on lower initial
            |funding. Thanks to their success they now have the time (&amp; experience) to improve on their animations.////Plus,
            |due to its unique style, I'm sure they just got more comfortable with it over time as well.

        |Little Jimmy Messina hates to see this.


        |Nice find.  So many edits of this.


        |OMG his lip syncing is SO BAD.


    |That was...////AMAZING!!!


    |It always cracks me up to see Ray walking again, he really should try to kill Archer.


    |When Cyril died I lost it.


        |it's a stretch, but i wonder if archer is binging and hallucinating top gun bc cyril *does* die.


    |The plaque for the alternates is down in the ladies room.


    |It was really the silhouette of the tongue that tied it all together.  


    |This video is everything I've ever wanted in a woman. 


        |And that's just Cyril. 


    |Such a great show...//Love the Dicky and Seamus tattoos :)


    |I hope they Archerize more things.  That was incredible.


    |There were 8 people that disliked this video on YouTube. I'm going to put those bastards away like Pam does bear claws


        |Ah yes, the local Zambezi tribesman called human flesh "long pig." Never much cared for it.


    |Woodhouse feeding quarters to the machine at the end is a reference to the start of the real video, see http://vimeo.com/47

    |WOODHOUSE!! AGAIN!!


    |Jester's Dead!!!


        |Doesn't count. You went below the hard deck .


        |Great Balls of fire!


        |The defense department regrets to inform you that your sons are dead because they were stupid.


    |Ok if ever a show was made to do a parody it's this. Family guy did Star Wars, Archer needs to do a full length Top Gun, th
    |t would be awesome.


    |Stop. My penis can only get so erect.

                                    |Ah, Irish guilt I suppose.


    |Was that from the last season or what? The animation is way more complex in this, and feels weird and slow, but that might 
    |ust be for effect.


        |nope this is a new trailer for the coming season just dropped today 


            |Ah, I'm still waiting for season 4 to come to netflix. I hope it comes soon, otherwise I might have to wait until s
            |ason 5 is over.


                |na you want to watch Season 4 first because the whole ending of season 4 is really going to affect how Season 5
                |plays out.


    |I'm not sure what I want more right now, to watch Top Gun, or to watch Archer. I guess a sandwich would be nice, also.


    |[Only time this is appropriate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5PhNTVLbJ4)


    |Please let this become an episode.


    |They even got the tongue right on the kiss.////Attention. To. Detail.


    |Given the shitty week I've had, I needed this.  Awesome.


    |Anybody else bummed out we have to wait until January for season 5?


    |Wee baby Sheamus is also in this zone of danger.


    |I just...this is everything I've ever wanted.  Thank you, web Gods.  


    |My uncle was the technical adviser to Top Gun. Considering my family's sense of humor, I like to think that this was his vi
    |ion from the beginning.


    |^^^Danger ^^^zone


        |&gt; Danger zone


    |The only problem with this video is now I have to clean the jizz out of my pants after viewing it.


    |Damnitsomuch. You made me re-live Goose dying all over again.


        |That was fucked up for me to see as a kid.


        |    Damnitsomuch. You //    made me re-live Goose dying //    all over again.


    |LANA


    |Wonder what the wee baby Seamus is reading.


    |That was both a trip down memory lane then a kick in the funny bone. I'm kind of a late comer to this whole Archer thing, p
    |obably discovering it just this last year or so. I normally sneer at TV in general, but lately things like Archer, Breaking
    |Bad, The Walking Dead, Game of Throwns (ha), True Blood, have me seriously entertained. ////TV has kicked up a notch or two
    | Archer produces burst out laughing results. Do you ever wonder if real secret spy agency people watch it, find it entertai
    |ing and use references from it while clowning around? 


        |True Blood?  Ouch.  It's a fun show, but damn it is fucking terrible.


    |Where is the Archer episode themed as Top Gun?! Every show does it with Star Wars, I wanna see them do it with Top Gun!


    |Lana! 


    |That was perfect. Absolutely perfect. Thank you OP.//


    |Looks like they've improved the animation again for season 5!
