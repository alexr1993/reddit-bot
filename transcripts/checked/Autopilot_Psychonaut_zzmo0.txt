    |Born and used to live in Switzerland:////* Switzerland did not create the Red Cross. Henry Dunant did. It's an NGO.//* While there are 
    |fficially four languages you'll have better luck finding somebody who speaks Cherokee than somebody who speaks Romansch//* It's a lot m
    |re complicated than that. If Germany had wanted to invade Switzerland, they could have, but it was convenient for everybody to have a b

    |ossible.//* Used to live on top of What because the Large Hadron Collider. Large parts of CERN are in France though.
