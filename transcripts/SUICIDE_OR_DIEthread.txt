Virgins that are 40 years old or older, what is life like?(/r/Ask Reddit...)




    |Mid 40s here.////&gt; In what way and how often does your virginity affect your life? ////It affects my life about as much 
    |s not being left-handed.//////&gt; How many people know about it? Are you a 'closet' virgin or are you open about it?////I'

    |I think about sex, and women, and sex with women, but not about being a virgin.////If I wanted, I could pay for it, and hav

        |Dear god this throwaway account name is awsome.


            |Yeah its kinda a shame its a throwaway. 


                |But it wouldn't be so awesome if it weren't. Catch 22.


                    |Oh, that's what catch 22 means.

                                    |Neither option is necessarily detrimental though, they just negate each other. It's a kind

                                    |Sounds like an awesome book.  The catch-22s I've heard nowadays are more like "I can't get

                                |That's what he wrote. He's pretty much quoting from the book. 


                            |Wouldnt a catch 22 also be "need job experience to get a job"? I wouldn't say there's anything detr

                            |You're example is right, but your definition is for "dilemma" and doesn't really define a catch 22.
                            |Right?

        |Dam man.  Fuck. I'm not sure what to say........ you sound content with yourself, but my god man.  You are missing out 
        |n life. //////Pay to get laid.  


        |I know I'm late to the party but for me personally you shouldn't waste it on some tramp. I did and I don't think that i
        | the way its supposed to be.


    |Not quite 40 yet, soon to be 33. ////I never learned how to ask a girl out, even though several of them asked me out and it
    |led to some very shallow relationships. In university I was in clubs that kept me very busy and had little time for a socia
    | life. Got into WoW for a year, picked up drawing as a hobby... And suddenly you are 27, work in an office where every girl
    |is at least 40 and usually divorced with kids, without a social life and you honestly have no idea how to ask a girl out or
    |even realize she is interested in you.////Fast forward 5 years. Relatively successful career, work 12 hour days and... well
    | nothing changed. I thought about helping nature a bit by paying for it. But the one time I ended up in a bar of ill repute
    | I was disgusted. ////I am honestly not worried about not having had sex. I'm worried about living my entire life alone. 


        |Try online dating man. I was at a point once where I was looking at finding girls to talk with who were compatible with
        |my personality so I answered a bunch of questions on OKC and chatted a few of the girls up I matched with (regardless o
        | distance) and it was nice to chat with people that you didnt know existed. I'm not suggesting a particular site to use
        | I'm just saying don't let any perceived stigma hold you back because everyone uses it these days. Gone are the days wh

            |I tried online dating a few years back. Met this one girl who was pretty nice but didn't hit it off. Kind of a weir
            | experience too, she never mentioned she lived with her parents, so when I went to pick her up for a first date her
            |mom invited me in for dinner.  //I've been meaning to try it again, but I have this kind of hate for online dating.
            |The only girl I've been with considered us just FWB but never told me that despite me asking. Few weeks later she e
            |ded up finding this dude 10 years older than us (she and I are the same age) and ended things with me, yet continue
            | asking me for advice on dating this guy. Now I hear she's moved in with the guy.


                |Well, you have to be prepared it will never be like movies show it, when the hero posts an online ad, and the f
                |rst reply he gets is his dream girl, and he just happens to be her dream man. There are lots and lots of differ
                |nt people who go online, and many of them go there because they were unable to find someone in real life, all f
                |r very different reasons. You will find girls that were too busy with their careers, who just got out of long t
                |rm relationships, who are outright crazy, some will be undercover hookers, etc. There will be one repeative the
                |e though -  they all could not find someone in real life. Your best bet is to try find someone with similar lif

        |Dude, that is pretty shitty. But let me give you a word of advice. This is coming from someone who tried to commit suic
        |de. Don't do it. I'm so happy that I failed. Seriously, doing that is not going to help. I did it because I also though
        | no one gave a shit about me, but I found plenty of people who do. Seriously man, don't give up. If you need help go to
        |a psychiatric facility. It sounds bad but I spent 2 weeks there and it helped. 


            |I'm pleased your life improved.////Mine hasn't. This is how I've decided to deal with it.


                |Hey man, I'm 18 and I'm not going to pretend to understand how you feel, but I will say this, things changed fo

                |PM me, OP. I'll listen. It's 10am in the morning here and I've got nothing better to do. Let's chat.


                    |or. . .you could PM him


                |Can I ask, what do you gain from killing yourself? Why is this solution the best one? Why is it better than jus
                |, living? I don't know the answer to these questions, so I'm asking you honestly.


                    |Coming from someone who HAS tried committing suicide, it's not that living is a lifestyle choice, it's a ch
                    |ice of lifestyle. And we want to have an option of getting out of such a banale and mundane world. //////Bu
                    | to OP, I say this to you: this too shall pass. It may not be tomorrow, or the next few days, next week, ne
                    |t month, next year etc. After all, Rome wasn't built on a day. But take it slow, one step at a time, to cha
                    |ge how you perceive the world and yourself. Smile at everyone you see today (fake it, what do you have to l
                    |se?), splurge on something that doesn't make sense and do it. Screw the others. You don't have anything to 
                    |ose now.//////


                        |I agree with him as well. Find the thing you love in life and put everything you have in it


                        |Couldn't you just, do something else? I suffer from severe anxiety and depression, but I never think ab
                        |ut killing myself. Just leaving and starting over.


                            |Suicide is the result of desperation born of illogical thinking or horrible life conditions, when a
                            |l other avenues have failed and you feel you have no choice except to end your life to end the mise
                            |y. I know this because I've been down far enough to have that thought process, fortunately I escape
                            | long before it could get the better of me.


                | Alaska, bro.


        |Please, reconsider your decision. Ultimately I can't stop you, and I won't try. But, as someone who attempted three tim
        |s and came very close twice, there are greener pastures ahead. Just the same, there are bumps in the road. I doubt you'
        |l ever recapture what you had with that woman. It seems apparent that you meant something to her, though. You can mean 
        |omething to someone else as well. Your life is only half complete and while things may never get easier, that doesn't m
        |an they're not worth experiencing. ////I don't know how you can turn things around. I don't want to be preachy. I just 
        |ant you to know that I would rather you be here, in this world, with the rest of us.


        |Wait. Dude.  Don't kill yourself!!!  Please don't.  You gave your fiancee lots of love, you still have lots of love to 
        |ive the world and to get in return!


            |What this guy says. You know love and how to give it and there are plenty of people who need it too. Please continu
            | to share your compassion and kindness into the world. Everyone knows it is very much needed out there.


            |Yes love is more important than sex. "Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all" and you had so
            |ething many people will never have.


        |Hi, jacobonaladder!////I have no business deciding whether or not you should asphyxiate yourself, but have you consider
        |d that you are a human being who is worthy (and everything that entails) and who has (and is) making an impact in this 
        |orld? Have you considered that even right now, you are helping to create dialogue and exchange ideas - that you are ins
        |iring (and taking part in) real human connection? I imagine your current circumstances must be undeniably difficult and
        |lonely - the isolation and loss of value that comes with that, but please know that I and many others are happy to talk
        |if you would like.


        |Please do not do that. 18002738255 is the national suicide prevention lifeline. Please call that number. I wont bullshi
        | you or give any ridiculous pleas and I know I am just a stranger on the internet but life is tough but it can get bett
        |r. Please do a random stranger this favor and talk to someone before going through with your plan.


            |When you call a number like that, the volunteers do a risk assessment. If I were to be honest with them, they would
            |send the police since I have an active method and a means to carry it out. I would be hospitalized against my will.
            |I would be released after the mandatory holding period since I don't have insurance. Then I would receive a bill fo
            | treatment I never asked for which did nothing to help me.////I know you mean well, but suicide hotlines can make l
            |fe worse. It took a long time to be at peace with my decision.


                |I'm guessing you're in the US, but the Samaritans (in the UK) offer non judgemental support for people consider
                |ng suicide. They won't try to dissuade you and won't contact any other organisations unless you ask them to. Yo
                | can email them here: http://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help-you/contact-us//


                    |Agreed. I've done some of the Samaritans training and know a volunteer with that service. They won't try an
                    | tell you what to do or interfere with your life like that.////You could call them from the US with a low c
                    |st international call or call [Samaritans USA](http://www.samaritansusa.org/programs.php), who seem to have
                    |a similar policy.////If you are unsure about their policy, you can just not give them your address or full 


                    |I respect what the Samaritans do as well as their approach to crisis. NA hotlines could learn from them.///
                    |Unfortunately it's not a toll free number for portions of the UK.


                        |That should stop you?  You're planning on killing yourself.  What would it matter?////Plenty of people 
                        |ind love, friends, hobbies, at 40.  Try overcoming inertia, and changing the way you live your life bef

                        |I'll be honest with you. I've read all of your comments, and this is the only one that doesn't make sen
                        |e to me. Reconsider this one suggestion.


                |Man, they need a better system in place. That sounds like a terrible time.


                |I understand. Best of luck Jake. Maybe give NHL 14 or GTA V a spin, video games are getting pretty elite these 
                |ays. I'd consider paying a sex worker for a quick lay too. The stigma is dumb and plenty of people benefit from
                |it. Mght as well check it off before you choose to pass. One of those things people exaggerate is the intimiacy
                |of sexual relations. A working girl and a girlfriend offer minimal difference in the actual experience in my op
                |nion. ////I hope i didnt have a condecending tone in my prior post, im just a dude whoe loves humans and hopes

                    |m not saying he should kill himself; if he can bear with it he should consider educating himself and try to

                    |Seriously? This man is on the cusp of ending his life and you attempt to bring him back from the brink with
                    |video games and hookers?

                |I've battled thoughts of suicide for a long time.  I recently started looking at the ways I deceive myself and

                |can't enjoy something in this life.  Maybe your expectations are just too high.  Mine usually are, and I think 
                |hat's a big part of what can make me miserable.  Dig deep my friend.  I'm not going to be the guy that says don

                    |proportional to our ability to love. 


                |It's reasons like this I wish assisted suicide wasn't so frowned upon. In all honestly I respect that you have

        |Dude... If you're going to go out voluntarily anyway,  make a trip to Thailand or somewhere else famous for sex tourism
        | and live it up for a few days first... Who knows,  you might even change your mind.  ////One of the great things about
        |suicide is that it has all of the characteristics of something likely to be procrastinated.... You can always do it tom
        |rrow or next year,  it's not like you are going to miss your chance.... It's stressful... It might really suck .... You
        |might not be good at it and screw it up.... It might lead to something  bad.... It is kind of embarrassing... You don't
        |get a chance to change your mind once you do it... Etc.  ////Basically,  any reason to procrastinate anything, it has. 
        |Feel free to put it off.  ////Feel free to live irresponsibly,  if need be... It's better than not living at all,  and 
        |ou might find a reason to go on.//// Do some crazy shit... Don't waste your life by wasting your death as well.  Make i
        | worth it..... What would you do if you were dying next month from cancer?  Well,  do those things now,  it might save

                |Well,  ok.  Not sure what I can do for you,  but if you're going to check out anyway,  I'd like to get to know

                    |Yes. That is, I do not have a bucket list.////My financial situation is dire. I carefully gave away what li

                        |Have you considered changing things up your life? Maybe something like getting involved in volunteering
                        | It would be a great place to make friends and help improve the world. I get that you're not happy but

                |Well hopefully you procrastinate your suicide. It really sounds like you're just incredibly depressed and still

                |I'm agreeing with Captain 150 here: some problems, like mental illness (depression, schizophrenia) are not temp

                    | me.////Once, a gay man asked me, "You know how you have that drive to shove your cock in someone's vagina 
                    |hen you're turned on?"////I said, "Yeah."  ////He said, "Well, it's like that when I think of a guy's cock.
                    | I just gotta have it in my mouth."  ////Me: ....  Oh!////[Moral of the story: it's about as explainable as
                    |a guy's urge to have sex.]


                    |It varies.  I LOVE sucking cock, but for the most part, no, I'm not going to go hit on a straight guy to tr
                    | to.


                    |They want to suck a straight guy's dick, or maybe scam you or rob you.


                    |Sucking dick is the only pleasure in my life, at least at the moment. I don't whore myself out on Craigslis
                    |... But if a situation arises, I will suck a dick. No shame in my game, some girls just like sucking dick. 


                    |Pretend you're a guy. Now pretend you're after people with the same sexual drive as you. Like NOT women. Se
                    | how easy it is to get laid and how often soliciting something online works. ////This is what always makes 
                    |e laugh when I see women claim they like sex as much or more than men. 


                    |its enjoyable and hot and if you're offering that with nothing in return, one might assume their chances ar
                    | better. I've been willing to only give a blowjob in the past, cuz i just wanted a little action...


                    |Well for one sucking cock is awesome and I wish I could just do it 24/7... More realistically they're close

                    |While some replies are true about gay men wanting to touch straight men etc. It can sometimes be a lovely e
                    |perience. This could just be a man who gets off mostly by pleasing his partner, and knows you are most like
                    |y not going to have penetrative sex with him, so he opts for something that multitudes of people *do agree 
                    |o* more frequently than you would think straight men should.


                    |As I understand it (having heard second hand from horny gal pals so riled up that despite having boyfriends
                    |they started asking *me* to come over) it's a mix of the usual desire for sex (that desire for intimacy, kn
                    |wing that you're making your partner want to orgasm as much as they're making you want to orgasm) combined 
                    |ith an oral desire akin to wanting to eat a really specific food.////In short, cock sucking (as has been ex
                    |lained to me) is women getting pregnant cravings for dick.////At this point I shall wait for a woman to com
                    | along and tell me no I'm totally fucking wrong and to take my lying bullshit somewhere else because what d
                    | I know as a guy.


                    |Are you a dude? Think about all the women you want to fuck just walking down the street.////They're the sam
                    |, but they want to fuck guys instead of women. It's really not surprising at all.


                        |Some girls are hot, but even them, licking pussy isn't too fun and I have no real urges to do it. The a
                        |t of sex is designed to be pleasurable, but sucking dick doesn't seem like it would be (we have a gag r
                        |flex after all).


                |And I three....


                |Wow that guy must really Luke giving head..


                |Fuck I've tried a legitimate dating site and that's the only response I've gotten. 


            |In one study, women said that men wearing "Axe" cologne were more attractive. The trick is, the women were watching
            |the men on TV.////What happened was, the men wearing the terrible body-spray, felt more confident, and acted more c
            |nfident. Enough so that women could consistently notice.////I'm not going to tell you to be confident though. You'v
            | heard that. My point is to realize just how good a first impression you might be making. Any human being is a coll
            |ction of a staggering amount of interests and personality. But if you hold back a bit, people will "fill you up" wi
            |h who they know how to relate to. For me, this concept has been a big foot in the door.////A lot of the stuff about
            |"getting in shape", or grooming or whatever - I don't think it's practical advice so much. Rather, it just means ap
            |earing like the kind of person a girl is used to spending time with. ////And none of this means changing "yourself"

            |Hey Chief. As a fellow 31 yr old who has been around the block with dating on and offline, thought I'd toss out a l
            |ttle advice I've gleaned from my own experiences. And as far as swooning over every pretty girl you see, that is ju
            |t a side effect of being a single romantic type guy. Some guys just daydream about getting a woman in bed while us 
            |omantics pine over kissing, cuddling and shit like that. ////So first tip is don't be overly romantic or piney on y
            |ur profile. Sure, you might want to let it be known that you are a sweet guy but with a simple short statement, not
            |with a poem or lyrics or a giant description of a romantic evening. Say "I've been told I am a very romantic guy." 
            |utting it in 3rd person saying what others have said about you really works. I have recreated profiles over the yea
            |s using basically the same photos and find that different profile descriptions definitely weigh in heavily on how m
            |ny responses you get in return and even recently did one that was getting me 2-3 new interests a week from actual d
            |cent women. Just think what a woman would want to read about her potential date. Sure, women love romance but being
            |a sappy sap online isn't going to convey that. It's important that they see you are a confident man and not a lonel
            | wuss. ////My latest approach is mystery with some badassness and a slight bit of braggadocio. It's difficult to ta
            |k about yourself in the best possible light without seeming like an ass. Keep things short and sweet, don't put you
            | entire life story. List the big accomplishments with very little detail. This way when a woman is interested you h
            |ve left her many openings for questions and conversation starters. But don't try to look too perfect. Admit that yo
            | have a few flaws, this gives a good honesty aspect which they will appreciate as well. ////One thing I did maybe i
            | a little cheating but the point is just to get a date here so I don't think there is much wrong with using all the
            |tools available to get that first face to face meeting. I zeroed in on the gal I wanted to meet and viewed her with
            |an older profile where I had answered a ton of the compatibility questions. Then just sign into a new profile and g
            | through giving the same answers as her. So maybe your old one was a 65% now you are 98% match and that seems to ma
            |e them take notice. I'm not saying do that to be totally fake because a lot of those questions are inconsequential 
            |nyway. It definitely works best with someone you are already a good match with, it just helps you get over the hump
            |and be noticed as you will be her #1 match every time she logs in. ////Good pics are obviously important too. Perso
            |ally I am a decent looking guy but not very photogenic. You need more than a couple lame selfies in your bathroom. 
            |s that his underwear on the floor? Are those... Skid marks? Lol. Chicks are actually the worst about those kind of 
            |ics... Have some of you and your buds laughing and having a good time. Have a pic where you look sexy as hell witho
            |t having your shirt off. I have some shirtless but I don't show below my nips. If you read their profiles most of t
            |em say they don't want to see a pic of you shirtless. But they do want to see your body, just with the clothes on. 
            |inicky those women. ////And lastly, you have to send just the right ice breaker message to get the convo going. You
            |can't be like "oh I can tell from the profile that I would love everything about you!" Act like you are skeptical a
            |out her. Ask just a couple questions but don't say too much right off the bat. I tend to always try and bring humor
            |right into it as this is just how I am anyway. I figure if we can't start off with a little playful banter then I r
            |ally don't want to talk to her anyway. And humor helps to get past the fog in her mind that you are probably just a
            |other creep. ////I've dated maybe 20 or so women just from online over the past few years. It is a rocky road full 
            |f absolutely insane women. So don't be surprised if you get all excited about meeting your dream girl only to find 
            |ut she is a nightmare! But there are good ones too! Take care and good luck! 


                |Some good advice there. I'm having trouble on okcupid too. I always attempt to ask women cute/funny questions a
                |d almost none of the replies I get reciprocate. It'll just be some short or generic answer that shows they're b
                |rely engaged with the conversation. It's like a rigged game where I do all the work and all they have to do is 
                |it back and judge whether it meets their standards. I can't stand that.


                    |Yea I've had a lot of that. Either they are not interested for some reason or else maybe your profile is a 
                    |urn off. Or they didn't find your joke all that funny. I'm definitely 1000% funnier in person vs text but I
                    |try. But if you are at least getting a response from them then that's a good sign. If the humorous approach
                    |gets a mediocre response then maybe counter back with a thoughtful question referencing something on their 
                    |rofile. If you set them up with a good question then they are more likely to open up a bit and give a decen
                    | answer. If I get a convo started I will try to balance questions with random stories or whatever about me 
                    |o it does not turn into just you asking her a ton of questions and her feeling like it's an interview. ////
                    | don't mind so much that I have to do all the work. The ones every guy wants to meet are bombarded by hundr
                    |ds of messages a day so the ladies tend to get jaded real fast. I have had a few of my online dates show me
                    |their date site inboxes and I was quite jealous how many messages they got. A lot of them bail after meetin
                    | just 1 douchebag.  So if you want the chance to meet a really awesome chick you need to stand out from the
                    |crowd in some way. ////Another part is just dumb luck. You might half mention something that just sets her 
                    |ff in a good way and she instantly wants to meet you. Like Olive Garden. I had been chatting up this gorgeo
                    |s model / musician / designer for over a month and was really trying to get that first date before our text
                    |ng back and forth faded away. I had at some point mentioned that Olive Garden had the dinner for 2 special 
                    |oing and asked if she wanted to go. Of course she put me off that night but she went on and on about how mu
                    |h she loved Olive Garden. A couple weeks later I made up an Olive Garden coupon on the pc. I had the offici
                    |l logo and colors and put a little message with her name for a complimentary dinner including transportatio
                    |, airfare ( we live in the same city it just sounded good) and delightful conversation. She thought it was 
                    |dorable and we went out that night. We hit it off pretty well too and dated for a few months.

            |In real life.... Have an upvote. Classic!


            |Lmao, this is the best story I have ever heard.


            |There is nothing wrong with going whaling every once in awhile. Fat girls need love too. If she's ugly in the face,
            |just make sure to bring two bags, one for her head and one for yours in case hers falls off.////I kid, I kid. But h
            |nestly, what do you think it is about you that has made you a virgin? Do you feel physically unattractive? Is it a 
            |ental thing? I'm curious.


            |What the fuck, man? You think having sex is like an achievement. It is not. Just talk to girls, ask them out and go
            |out with them. You'll find that sometimes it's even better than sex itself. If you do something, eventually you'll 
            |et laid. 


            |hey man, beggars cant be choosers, plus those obese women feel your pain and looking for love too.


            |TLDR ; DMHS////I was a 26 year old virgin.////I pretty much abandoned my standards for the first time I had sex usi

            |s just as much of a turn off for women (lack of confidence = poor reproductive success) as an obese woman is to a g

            |Yeah I'm with ya when it comes to personal standards, especially with online dating.  I don't believe mine are incr

            |i think i disagree about it getting out having the potential to ruin you.  I'm also a 31 year old virgin, and i cou
            |dn't care less who knows.  I was religious for a long time, so it was expected for the single adults in my church t
            | be virgins, so there was no pressure.  But now i've left religion behind and have some awesome friends who are in 
            |o way religious, and i always joke around about being a virgin and they don't judge me or treat me differently.  On
            |the contrary, they're the truest friends i've ever had, and always make me feel wanted and welome.


            |I hate all the usual advice so I would just say work out if you don't already. That in itself is so important on ma
            |y levels.


            |&gt;Every time I see an attractive girl I wonder what it would be like to hold her and kiss her.////This isn't nece
            |sarily because you're a virgin. I've had lots of sex *and* I'm getting regular sex and I still think about random s
            |rangers like this.


            |I don't know why, but I like you. The right balance of logic, reasoning, and relatable humanity in one package.


            |I met my current significant other at a Reddit meetup. Have you tried that?////(Mind you, I've been to Reddit meetu
            |s in other cities and they were...something I wish I hadn't attended. ie neckbeards and fedoras galore). It's hit a

            |Did you try some other places? I think both online dating and clubbing is for specific kinds of people (i.e. handso
            |e, confident), because you're judged mostly by your looks.////What helped me taking dance lessons, and going to Toa
            |tmasters. Toastmasters were great because they taught me how to talk to people, and dance lessons taught me how to 
            |ouch women. Those activities by themselves are not very good for picking women, but once you happen to be at a part
            | or any other social gathering, if you know how to talk, and you know how to dance, you should be all set.////It's 
            |ot instant, but 2-3 years of work and you'll make it.////Also, you can find a mentor - someone who you see is good

            |ave good memories of the act.//////


            |If you want to change your life up age is not a factor, ignore the pressure of society,you only fail when you give 
            |p in my opinion. I say go for a relationship, join up to a bunch of dating sites, work of exercise everyday, work o
            | social skills, try some hobbies. keep changing and improving your profile pictures, watch videos and guys chatting
            |on girls and then try it yourself and defeat that fear. Then contact a lot of women hundreds even in your area just
            |spread that net far. Out of a hundred you will get a few replies, go for a date fast so you don't get stuck in an i

            |OK Cupid might work out for you. It hasn't for me yet, but who knows whether or not it will for you.

            |Yeah I've never been in a legit relationship.  The only one I was in, I was "the other guy" and it got close to sex
            | but I couldn't get the job done when it came to it.  That messed me up mentally I think.  Because we tried like tw
            | more times and it was the same failed result...which made it worse.  


                |The key is understanding that both of you have similar fears. She probably thinks she doesn't look good enough 
                |or you, and you're sitting there thinking something's wrong with you. Remember, it's HER job to make YOU feel g

                |able to fuck someone and feel a lot of pressure. Vent your anxieties. Don't hold them in. Sit back, close your 
                |yes, and I guarantee you she'll make it her goal to get you up. Then she'll feel awesome and sexy for being you

                        |d on photos - most people are skinner, prettier or more muscular in them. //2) You will get frustrated 
                        |t times with people who are shallow or are just not compatible with you. Keep on going!//3) Find a loca
                        | pub or restaurant as your date spot - don't do the movies or anything that requires too much of a comm
                        |tment for your first date.//4) There are a lot of people on there just looking for sex - but there are 
                        |till people out there who are looking for an honest relationship and not just a booty call.//5) Brush o
                        |f the bad experiences and keep moving along. I can tell you stories that you probably wouldn't believe 
                        | but I survived and I can laugh about them now. You will too! ////I am glad your getting out there. You
                        |deserve to be happy!////Best of luck! ////

            |In my experience people who already feel a little awkward about dating/sex do not do well in a situation like onlin
            | dating where there is this pressure to be romantic with someone you don't know.  I think it's much easier to meet 
            |omeone in a sport or class, game night, trivia, singles clubs that do activities all together in a group, etc. 


            |The thing I always tell myself any time I meet someone on a dating site is "They're on this site for a reason." Tha
            | reason could be the same as mine (meaning "couldn't be arsed"), but more often than not, after a few messages and

                |Booty calls are cheaper than paying, and no relationship required.

                |you don't pay a hooker for sex, you pay her to leave.


                |Cheaper, too.


            |In the same line of thinking, you could just as easily say fuck *not* paying for sex. If you have the money, you ca
            | have sex with exactly the kind of woman you like without having to deal with all of the "applying yourself."  This
            |can be especially advantageous to people who are not seeking any kind of relationship out of the encounter, or just
            |don't have the time. Why bother playing the ridiculous game of getting casual consensual sex if you have the means 
            |o avoid all of the hassle and you desire nothing more than the sex itself? Any fantasy, any type of woman you have 
            |ver wanted to fuck can be acquired with a quick transaction. 


                |&gt; If you have the money, you can have sex with exactly the kind of woman you like////What if the exact kind 
                |f woman I like is the kind of shy reserved girl who would never have sex for money? I'm not joking; these are t

            |Don't we all end up paying for sex in some way lol.


            || If you just apply yourself////For me, *applying myself* means venturing far outside my comfort zone repeatedly, o
            |ly to get rejected. The emotional damage that does to me is more than I can handle, so I don't do it very often.///
            |So I pay for sex and I would never admit it to most of the people close to me. I'm not ashamed of it though, I feel
            |it's an essential step on my path towards a happier life.


            |who pays for the dates?


            |same reason Icon parking garages exist


            |is sex ever really free??!


            |Some can apply themselves and get sex. The problem is, for some people, it's as difficult as finding free parking i

            |its rarely free. if you dont pay for sex then your paying for dinner and drinks


            |Most people have better things to do than roam around in circles all day hoping to get a break. You sound pretty lo

                |LOL...there are a lot of lonely people who still get plenty of sex. Nothing wrong with that. If you're going to
                |be lonely, might as well do some good fucking now and again.


            |fuck you. i prefer paying for sex on occasion. you don't have to pretend to give a shit about what the're  saying,

        |What's wrong, in your opinion, in paying for it? Why's it "desperate"?


            |I think this may be partially why I'm still a virgin.  Internally struggling with my own morals of doing it just to

                |I'll chime in here and say that my first time was with someone I cared dearly about (at the time) and it made i

            |In these circumstances, tap it regardless.


    |I'm a 30 year old dude, not quite 40+, but I've had a profound experience so far with being a virgin still.////At my work a
    |lot of my girl co-workers liked to flirt and joke with me a lot, some even joke about hooking up. I feel strange dating/mat
    |ng co-workers so I never really jumped on those chances. Nonetheless I get a lot of attention from the girls.////It wasn't 
    |ntil I decided to hang out with one of them, one of the girls I knew that had a crush on me and we just had coffee. She sta
    |ts talking about her past boyfriends and how she's in her early 20's and has already had a dozen of them. I was nervous and
    |she asked me how many girlfriends I've had. I kept trying to dodge and weave but it just made her more persistent on asking
    |me.////I finally admitted that I've never had a girlfriend before, I've never even been kissed before. She thought I was ki
    |ding. I wasn't. When she realized what I am, she suddenly went from being attracted to being disgusted. Coffee ended shortl
    | and she stopped talking to me since then.////Soon, all the girls stopped talking to me. They all started treating me like 
    | leper. I went from being this guy that got a lot of attention to being a nobody, like I was dead. I felt it. They treated 
    |e like I was this gross human being. It's like I grew this giant tumor on my face overnight that I can't see but somehow it
    |turns people off.////I get angry and frustrated because I often hear stories of guys who were rejected for having none to t
    |o little sexual experience, but I have never heard a story of a guy who was rejected for having too much.////My advice for 
    |oung men. Lose it as soon as you can. If you can't, lie. The older you are that someone finds out that you're a virgin, the
    |worse. I know a lot of people out there don't see what the big deal is, but until you realize that other people treat you l
    |ke a child, or when you are rejected by a girl when she finds out, well, you're going to wish you went to more parties with
    |girls who have loose morals.////It only becomes more difficult once you're older. I get treated like a freak. It's like liv
    |ng in 2013 without a cellphone. Girls start flaking on me once they find this out about me. They know that I'm no prize. It
    |s not like I'm at risk of being lost to another girl. 


        |If girls are actually attracted to you to start joking and flirting with you, you're already golden! If they bring it u

            |I agree with you.  If some girl is joking with you about hooking up, that means she wants to hook up.  Nobody is ob

            |In my experience, the best part is, as long as you're confident, it doesn't even matter if you suck (*generally*; o
            |viously it has to be passable.) I feel like there's a good chance they'll think "He's gotten girls off *like this*?
            | rather than "wow i dont think he's had any experience, he has no clue what he's doing". The fact that girls (and g
            |ys) like very different things plays to our favor. I mean you can always say something like "what do you like?", as
            |you're doing it. First time I fingered a girl I just copied whatever I remembered in porn and read on the internet,
            |and it actually worked out well. She had no clue I was inexperienced. I was nervous no doubt, but I was also having
            |fun, so I focused on that, and it worked out.////Most importantly though, I think it's about HAVING FUN. Don't get 
            |aught up with getting her off or vice versa. I haven't had sex with that many girls, but I've talked to many girls 
            |bout sex. Even if the sex is "good" mechanically, if it just feels like a process, like another hookup, I doubt you
            |ll get called back for a booty call. I feel like virgins who've stayed virgins for a long time are in that position
            |because they get caught up with their inexperience and get anxious and nervous when they have a chance to get laid,
            |causing them them to avoid or screw up the opportunity, further perpetuating the cycle. There's a first time for ev
            |rything. Have fun. Disappoint a girl. Laugh at yourself. really, what's the worst that can happen?


            |&gt;just say "I don't kiss and tell"////That's about as effective as when officials say "I can neither deny nor con
            |irm that"


            |and then plow through her!////edit: fuck someone beat me to the punch :(


            |Better yet, use your response to play up an aspect of people that usually isn't seen until dating someone over a lo
            |ger period of time: respecting their wishes.////"I don't kiss and tell" is super flirty and whatnot, but saying som
            |thing like, "They wouldn't want me talking about the details of our relationship" or "our time together," makes it 
            |learer that you're respecting these other women's privacy, not just for your sake, but for theirs.  (Whether these 
            |omen exist or not doesn't mater.)  And that kind of manly respect makes you instantly awesome in most women's eyes.

        |I'm around the same age and have never been in a relationship.  I dunno how recently this happened to you or if it's ha
        |pened more than once, but way more of this has to do with the nature of the people you're dealing with than you being w
        |ird.  Especially when you have that office groupthink bullshit as a factor.////I've noticed folks in general talk about
        |relationships *a lot*.  Their own relationships, who other people are seeing, and inevitably, whether or not you are in
        |olved in one.  Human beings are monkeys and are super curious about it and most of the other people they talk to are th
        | same.  Odds are good they picked up on you never referencing a past girlfriend or seeing anyone on your own.  This is 
        |hat's happened to me.  They aren't stupid -- they start to think something might be up and that makes them even more cu
        |ious.  They may gossip about it.  The girl that had a crush on you probably had some indication or she wouldn't have in
        |errogated you about it.////Some of them are bound to be judgmental about it.  Maybe even most of them.  Fuck 'em.  Who 
        |he fuck stops talking to someone because they haven't had sex?////Keep in mind that your reaction to their reaction is 
        |oing to determine how things progress from the initial bomb drop.  If you're super ashamed and uncomfortable about it o
        | frustrated or whatever else and have a hard time dealing with them after they've had a bad reaction you're probably re
        |nforcing whatever negative bullshit they've made up in their head about the reason why you've never bumped uglies.  All
        |it is, is what it is.  It sounds like the people you work with kind of suck and they may talk shit any which way, but a
        |big part of how they act towards you is rooted in how you handle it.////I dunno, man.  I don't know anything more about
        |your situation than what you've written here, but my personal experience has been that it's a lot harder for people to 
        |e shitty about it if you don't let them see that it 's something you're sensitive about.  If you shrug it off and pursu
        | conversation with them as normal and they still treat you like an alien, they're the asshole and they'll know it.  If 
        |you* get weird about how you handle telling them or how you act afterwards (avoiding them bc you're embarrassed for exa
        |ple) I imagine they feel more justified in alienating you.////The fact is that most people you bump into at that age ha
        |e probably already had sex, but you are far from the only 30 year old that hasn't.  Probably helps too if you can play 
        |t off with some self-deprecating truths like, "I was kind of a nerd in school/college and then got really busy with wor
        | and now here I am," as opposed to, "I dunno I just never liked anyone/nobody ever liked me."////I am making a lot of a

            |What they said. They're not worth your time or hassle. I've found myself caught up with people over the years who I
            |ve cared a lot about, put a lot of effort in, and received nothing in return. Just cut those strings and move on, y
            |ur better than them 


            |exactly. any girl who   gets disgusted by a person being a virgin is probably a ranking slut


            |Agreed, she saved you a lot of trouble by exposing her true shitty self before things went further, and anyone else
            |that has changed just by knowing a meaningless fact about you is a life saver, drop them and get with real people.


            |Was about to say this. When I met my boyfriend he was 25 and still a virgin. He sheepishly admitted it one day when
            |we were talking and honestly I didn't give a shit. He's just such a wonderful man and something as trivial as being
            |a virgin just doesn't matter to me. His inexperience in bed quickly passed and we now have explosive passionate sex
            |regularly. 


            |True, but unfortunately things that people agree on and what people actually will do to you don't mix.


            |doesn't matter he should have lied and fucked the shit out of her, so next time he meets another girl, he would fee
            | less awkward


            |then he wont have a relation with anyone because most people are like that.


            |Even more of a reason to only have sex with them


            |that's a good news. but still bad news is some coworkers being disgusted, even if for wrong reasons. he goes to wor
            | every day and gets treated like a poop by them coworkers. that's sad. mean girls!


            |This is the norm. The appearance of confidence and being the guy other women want is everything. If you, as a man, 
            |on't have it in a dating situation, almost all women will reject you. It is very emotionally superficial and bigote
            | but then again, this is what humans are.


            |It also depends on how he handled that situation. If he instantly became defensive or stumbled around and then didn
            |t have a follow up conversation with the girl or girls then that could also lead to the alienation.////TL;DR: the s
            |tuation is most likely reversible, he could have follow-up conversations with his female co-workers about why they 
            |re acting strange with him.


            |Oh yeah, that really helps him now that his a 35 year old virgin. 


            |If that person is a cute girl who likes you and you're a virgin, then you most certainly do want a relationship wit
            | her. Even a platonic and brief relationship is better than being forever alone.


            |While i agree, i don't know why people throw this generic shit around. It's not much consolation.


            |I don't think a relationship is what we're looking for...


        |&gt;I get angry and frustrated because I often hear stories of guys who were rejected for having none to too little sex
        |al experience, but I have never heard a story of a guy who was rejected for having too much.////Well, if it helps any..
        | I've had a lot of fun from when I was roughly 15 years old to the point where I turned 25.////Some time around then, I
        |finally felt like I could settle down and be commited to someone. Not too long later, I was completely swept off my fee
        | by this beautiful girl, and we really hit it off. She actually told me she hadn't felt like this in years, too... and 
        | don't think I've ever felt quite like this ever before.////Anyway, weeks later, she talked to one of her friends who k
        |ew me from "before"... Yup, you guessed it. Rejected. She practically wouldn't even talk to me anymore.////I can tell y
        |u it hurt like a motherfucker, sometimes and in a way it still does. Thankfully I've since found another lovely girl th
        |t I'm now 100% exclusive with...////Still, now you've heard *that* story, too.//


            |This will sound like I'm an asshole, and I intend for it to be this way, but what you experienced was the pain of u
            |fulfilled entitlement. You always got something easy and for the first time in your life you were denied that thing
            | It doesn't compare to the pain of life-long rejection. Well, it does. About the same way as not getting that cake 
            |ou wanted compares to slowly starving to death.


        |Amen, It gets worse and worse as you get older. Being honest about the fact that you've had few relationships is a bigg
        |r and bigger red flag to women as they age. If I'm going out with someone my age ,admitting I've had only a couple rela
        |ionships and that I've spent my life mostly single has been an immediate dealbreaker every time. ////if I could go back
        |and give one piece of advice to my highschool/ early 20s self it'd be lie your ass off and get laid. It is unfortunate 
        |ut the majority of women seem to be too fucking stupid to understand. ////Being a "normal" douchebag has far more benef
        |its than being a decent, honest, sucessful, super-athletic guy. I have more money than I know what to do with. I am a f
        |eaking marbile statue of health and virility. I work with kids for a living. Yet I'm always too fucking perfect for som
        | and not seemingly "interested" enough for others. OMG I have self control, fuck me right?////After awhile I just wish 
        | could be gay.


            |A word of advice, saying " the majority of women seem to be too fucking stupid to understand," does not help your c
            |se any... ////Honestly, from the way you speak you sound like a douche yourself. The kind of mentality that the iss
            |e must be everybody else is "too stupid" and has nothing to do with the way you are. The good guy syndrome where yo
            | see popular guys as jerks even if you don't know them very well. ////Not all women are shallow and go after jerks,
            |don't assume that just because you can't get any.


                |It's also worrying the amount of upvotes he's receiving. Some other asshole rejects thinking that girls are som
                | fantasy creature that need to be tricked into bed. ////


        |I feel compelled to say that it is possible that you are unintentionally imagining some of their behavior. Hear me out,
        |I'm on your side. ////Whenever we are insecure about something or have a "flaw", we think the whole world is judging us
        |and their behavior towards us are in direct relation to how big the flaw is. When I get a bad haircut I think everyone 
        |s looking at me and treating me different. The truth is, those girls probably don't care as much as you think. Sex/your
        |virginity is a huge issue for YOU, but why would it matter that much to anyone else? I'm just saying, as long as you ar
        |n't going around making your virginity a huge issue or part of your identity then others won't make it a big deal. So b
        |sically, chill out, I'm sure you just think people are treating you different but they probably aren't. 


            |I've gotta say I agree. It sounds like you're focusing on the difference in sexual experience between you and the w
            |men you work with, and making that into a bigger issue than it probably is for them. The way you write also makes i
            | sound like you have something against these women. Your advice to men is to lose their virginities ASAP but then y
            |u refer to women who have a lot of sex as 'girls who have loose morals'. Then you paint the women you work with as 
            |ruel and heartless and say they bully you for being a virgin. It sounds to me like you've distanced yourself from y
            |ur coworkers to avoid further heartache, which is one thing. But you've done that by elevating yourself above them.
            |They have loose morals because they're sexually experienced. They're cruel and they treat you badly because you're 
            |ifferent. Are they really? Or are you putting up a wall to protect yourself from more rejection?////TL;DR - if you 
            |reat your coworkers like the bullying whores you apparently perceive them to be, no wonder they're not flirting wit
            | you any more.


                |Dude. Read his post again. He is nowhere as negative as you say.//The one thing was "girl of loose morals" whic
                | in my book more sounds like a snappy euphemism. I could hear a girl saying that about herself, when asked abou
                | her experience.//////&gt;But you've done that by elevating yourself above them.//////Please tell me where you 
                |ead that.////The stigma he described is real. //////My advice for people in similar situations. Lie your butt o
                |f, until you changed your status. Worked for me.


        |As a twenty something year old woman who runs in many different social groups I personally don't know many others who w
        |uld treat you the way your coworkers have, so it could just be the immediate circle of friends you had/have. Please don
        |t internalize their narrow perceptions of how others should be. 


        |That sounds like one of those situations in which lying is acceptable. Make some shit up now, that way when someone doe
        | ask, you can rattle it off the top of your head. You can also make like you don't like talking about your past from th
        | moment you start seeing someone. It'll 1) make you more mysterious, and 2) help prevent future questions "what about t
        |is" or "that girl that did this" etc etc.


        |The girls who did that dont deserve your time.They're pretty shallow to do that.


            |The things you say sound kind of misanthropic. 


        |If a girl thinks you're weird and off limits because you havent had sex, that is weird to me. Maybe Im just not as sexu
        |lly driven as others, but some of the best times with my fiancee have been just us talking. Sex is wonderful, yes, but 
        |heres nothing better than emotionally connecting with someone.


        |I'll just say this, if girls are running because of that one thing, then they aren't who you want to be with 


            |The first girl was a dick, yes. But all the other girls? It's hard to say. If she went into work the next day, and 
            |ome of them asked how the date with X went, and she exaggerates (as people tend to do, and I bet she was DYING to t
            |ll the story) "Oh yeah, he's such a weirdo - I can't believe he's never even had sex - or even kissed a girl! It's 
            |razy!" "Isn't he, like, 30? What's wrong with him?"////It leaves a bad impression on their minds. Also, there's the
            |social aspect of it - if one of them goes out with him, then they're going to be outcast from the group of friends 
            |oo.


        |This is really good advice.  I had a similar experience after having sex with a girl in my late 20s.  I wanted to be op
        |n with her, so I confessed my pisspoor romantic history to her.  Big mistake.  The loss of respect was immediate.  We w
        |re no longer just 2 consenting adults having some casual fun and seeing where it was going; we were no longer peers.  S
        |e just couldn't see me as a mature man anymore.  It's like I was a child.  The next time I talked her, she was breaking
        |up with me, even though things had been going great.////If you're in this boat, lie, and don't even feel bad about it. 
        |You really can't be honest about it with people.  Make up a fake sexual resume in advance, something simple so it's eas
        | to remember so you can offer it up credibly on demand.  Doesn't have to be a lot of encounters, just a handful so you'
        |e not viewed as a freak or some sort of inept man-child.


        |To but it bluntly, the psychology of women is fucked up.


            |Please don't broadly generalize us. We are not all insane like that. 


                |Yeah, you're right. I apologise. My bitterness is showing.


                    |It's cool; we all have that sometimes :)


            |Nope, it's not. I'll try to explain. Women value men's rank in society. Women want a man with the higher rank. Most
            |of them would choose a man with the higher rank. Man surrounded by girls always has a high rank. Even if the girl h
            |rself don't find him attractive, she would probably change his mind if she sees that all other girls finds him attr
            |ctive. That's why guys never gets rejected for having too much sexual experience. On the other hand, 30 years old v
            |rgin means that no other woman found him attractive. That particular girl liked him at first, but then got turned o
            |f because he told her he had no luck with girls. She assumed that she was wrong about him. It's like "I can be wron
            |, but everyone else can't be wrong!". She let the crowd think over herself. That's what most people do. Most of gir
            |s would be turned off by the fact that a man is 30 years old virgin. But some of them, who thinks by themselves, no
            | by the crowd, won't.////Sorry for my poor English.


                |I am aware of that. My point is that this kind of thinking is outdated and often leads to making bad decisions.
                |Stubborness, hostility and being unreceptive to opposing ideas are mistaken for signs of strength. Basically, t
                |e primitive desire for rank gets in the way of finding a decent person who would actually make them happy.


                    |Most of people are dumb. They don't know what they need, they don't know what they want. They don't think f
                    |r themselves. It's not just a female thing, it's common for all people. So it's correct to say that people 
                    |re fucked up, not just women.


                        |Men do indeed have their own range of flawed mental tendencies.


        |I'm a woman who was once a girl with questionable morals, and I deflowered many a virgin in my day.  Not all girls are 
        |ssholes about it.  Just the dumb cunts you work with, apparently.  Forget 'em.  Immaturity.  I'm sorry, man.


        | I knew a never been kissed kind of virgin in college that drove me wild. I had a boyfriend, so I never propositioned h
        |m, but damn if I didn't want to corrupt him all day and night. (It probably made a huge difference that he was socially
        |adept and funny, but he wasn't killing it in the looks department at all.)


        |Yeah, the problem with having sex with a virgin (from their perspective) is that they can't just "try" having sex with 
        | virgin. There is this assumption of baggage associated with it and all of these concerns about attachment. Girls want 
        |o have sex, but they don't want to feel like having sex means they have to get married. ////I think it's an effect up t
        |ought process, but that's about how it goes.


            |Would that make prostitution the only out for those virgins? That would tangible proof that they won't marry the fi
            |st thing they have sex with.


        |As a girl, I have to say that I find virgin-dudes much, much sexier than guys who have slept around. I was a total slut
        |in my younger years and that was whatever, but the guy I really fell for was a virgin at 25. Fucking him the first time
        |was a spiritual experience. The knowledge of him having sex (or in this case, anything) for the first time in his life 
        |as so orgasmic.


        |I'm sorry this happened to you. I was 27 when I met my fiance;  he was 28. He was a virgin, I was not. It didn't bother
        |me. If anything, I felt more comfortable being around him since there didn't seem to be as much pressure to act like so
        |e ultra sexy girl (that I'm clearly not). ////That said, I made him wait a looong time before we had sex because I want
        |d to be sure I was the right person for him to sleep with for his first time. He never saw the situation the same way, 
        |ut I worried that he'd regret sleeping with me after having waited so long to have sex in the first place. ////Eventual
        |y we took the plunge and it was fine. Not mind blowing, but not awful. We both got better as we learned what the other 
        |iked.  ////Being a virgin isn't wierd or strange, and the women at your work treating you like a leper are clearly shal
        |ow and superficial. I'm sorry they're making you feel thw way they are. Sex isn't that big of a deal when it comes down
        |to it. And honestly, I wish I hadn't lost my virginity when I did. I wish I had waited like my fiance did. I envy him a
        |little for that. 


    |Life sucks. (37 years old). Most days, I consider killing myself for being such a waste of human existence. Ashamed of bein
    | a male human. Feelings of inadequacy. ////Like I can't believe I was the fastest sperm that came out of my father's balls.
    |Unable to attract a woman (despite no physical defects) in an age where casual sex is not just the norm, it is like breathi
    |g air. It feels like I wish I had some sort of disease or crippling physical defect that would at least give me an excuse f
    |r not having done it. ////It has affected my confidence and self esteem (from work, to relationships with friends and famil
    |) and basically shattered me in ways not many would understand. The longer time passed (I am talking about my early 20's), 
    |he more anti-social, afraid to just interact in the society I became. Women could sense the awkwardness, the shyness, they 
    |ould sniff it out. Like I had a tattoo on my forehead that said "VIRGIN"////In my later 20's, I became extremely bitter, fu
    |l of hatred for myself, women, successful normal men. ////In my 30's, it became less about the sex and more about the not h
    |ving any intimacy of any kind. Not knowing what it feels like to kiss a girl, make out, cuddle, anything.////Sigh. ////So f
    |r I have refused to pay for it as then I think of it as being unable to naturally get a woman. It would still make me a fre
    |k. I have no issue with people paying for it, but usually people who pay for it, have already attracted women normally with
    |ut it, and just want physical sex without effort of dating and etc.... So it is not the same.//


        |I was like you. I still haven't had sex, but the poster who said that your attitude is the key to changing everything i
        | right.////I met a great girl, loved knowing her, and she helped me value things about myself and life that weren't tie
        | to whether or not I was attracting women.////It has been almost a year since, but I went from being suicidal to being 
        |roductive and happy.////I've been getting more attention from women, enjoying my old hobbies more, and being more ambit
        |ous than I ever was.////I even heard from an old friend that, yes, she would have sex with me (just to do it) if she we
        |en't single, if I wanted to experience it with someone I could trust.////I don't view having sex as a big deal. It is a
        |small trifle thing.////To illustrate the problem, you could spend your entire life not using shaving cream when you sha
        |e. Maybe you'd have terrible razor burn and it would never look good, and something as small as that would cause huge c

        |stupid step that no one really talks about because they're so used to including that step that they don't even notice./
        |//I think having sex is the same. And it's different from "attracting women". You have the potential to attract very ma
        |y women. But your attitude about yourself is what will drive people away every time, and your frustration over a small 
        |tep or trifle thing is only making that attitude harder to manage.////You're not inadequate. No one is disappointed in 
        |ou. No one wants you to go without intimacy. It almost has nothing to do with you -- all you need to do is start shavin

        |ing a much different existence through simple changes.////If you can have a friend, you can have a girlfriend, for sure
        | The jump in between involves changing your attitude and mastering yourself.////Sometimes, I still feel bad about mysel

        |on't need to feel bad about myself. Feeling bad about myself changes nothing for me, it just makes me suffer unproducti

                        |Ok good to know. For you though, Match.com's original name for the app was called Matchbox (sorry I got
                        |it wrong, but whatever). When they sent the app to women (primarily models in order to get hot girls on
                        |the product), they didn't like the name OR use the product much. The creator of the app changed the nam

                |/Anyway, I'm sorry for rambling there.  Point being is, paying for it will *not* solve the core issue, as his c

                |viscous cycle.


                    |That's really pathetic, and I'm sure you've heard it before. No one cares that it's pathetic though, except
                    |maybe your family, it's really about personal growth. Shame is meaningless, but you're leaving money on the

                    | it, and then seek out women for sexual relationships.


                        |Hah, like hell if I'd allow my family to know any of this.  As far as they are concerned, I'm the happi

                        |t, it shows pretty obviously, women get freaked out by it and you never get any.  Because you never get
                        |any, you don't think anyone *desires* you and *wants* to fuck you, and you think you are a worthless pi
                        |ce of shit.  And then the cycle feeds on itself.  *Paying* is not the same thing as a woman *desiring* 
                        |o fuck you.  It doesn't break that feedback loop, you are still failing because you had to literally *p
                        |y* someone to want to bang you, despite them not wanting to.////I don't really know how else to explain
                        |it, but I guaranteed you paying for it wouldn't help him as he isn't just trying to get over first-time
                        |anxiousness, he's working past a whole lot more than just that.

                |I think paying for it would just leave him with shame and more feelings of inadequacy.


                    |There's no shame in paying for it. He's personally stunted and he needs to experience sex to grow. All of i
                    |, the foreplay, the act, the cuddling afterwards. If that means a 12 hour session, so be it.


                        |There is no shame in it, but sometimes it's simple reaction. If he feels that he will, without a doubt,
                        |feel no shame, then go for it. If not, then I would hold off.


        |Not nearly as old as you, but I feel where you're coming from. For me it's not so much the sex, but the loneliness. See

        |if youre actually serious, that has nothing to do with being a virgin.

        |ned it for your sperm to be able to enter.


            |Wow dude. Awesome way to make him feel better. //


        |Just pay for it and get it over with. You know what you are going to find? It's not that big of a deal and you are goin
        | to be PISSED at yourself for not doing it much sooner.  Yea, it's a good time but it isn't worth centering your life o
        |.  Once that's done, maybe you can having meaningful relationships with women, just as a friend. Because after having s
        |x, you will realize its great but it's not a big deal. Women don't exist as objects solely to stick your penis in.  If 
        |ou can have a female friend, you can have a girlfriend.  First you have to quit treating women like a mystical unicorn 
        |hat you'll never "have".


            |Dude, I'm in the same boat as VI, paying will *not* help.  At that point you just realize that not only are you suc
            | a worthless failure that no woman will have any sort of relationship with you, you're *such* a failure that you ha
            |e to pay a woman to *pretend* to give a shit about you and fuck you.  That becomes so much incredibly more pathetic


                |Oh whatever. Let me tell you a story.////Long ago when I was a teenage virgin deuce, I was very horny all the t
                |me and totally ready to bang someone. However, it was hard for me to form the necessary relationship because I 
                |as starting to verge on desperation. Nobody wants to bang someone wearing eau de desperation, so people kept th
                |ir distance. I had the thoughts most people have (Oh, wouldn't it be nice if it was romantic, etc), but I'm a r
                |alist. I'm also a researcher.////After much research, reading about others' experiences, I came to this conclus
                |on: virgins are super bad at sex. The first time is nearly guaranteed to be awkward at best, and unpleasant at 
                |orst. So, I decided to do it with someone that I probably would never see again.////Age 16: went on a trip with
                |my family. Found a local who was my age and DTF. Did it. It was super awkward. "Uh, is this your first time?"  
                |/"Yep."  //"Ok."////Of course, I never saw the lad again. But, I went home, and had a newfound confidence. Boys
                |weren't scary to me anymore. I knew what to expect now. I quickly got a boyfriend and from then on had an adequ
                |te amount of normal, healthy relationships. And I even learned to be decent at sex too.////So, sometimes you ju
                |t need to pop the cherry to get past the psychological block. There's really no shame in paying for it. In fact
                | I view what I did as, in a way, "paying for it", in that I specifically used this lad for sex, and he was a to
                |al stranger. The only difference was that I'm a chick and chicks basically never have to pay for sex.


                |You're not paying a hooker to feign intimacy, you're paying her to get your rocks off and leave. ////The notion
                |that sex is a big deal can be a huge mental blocker, and getting your first bang out of the way helps you to se
                | that it's nothing, really. ////True intimacy is something else altogether, but removing the mental block can h
                |lp to get there.


            |Don't put the pussy on a pedestal.


            |Amen:-)  lost virginity recently. Very meh, sex isnt that big of a deal


                |...you need to have better sex.


            |Wow, the majority of people don't really understand this problem, but the level to which you don't understand it is
            |frankly impressive.


            |I know a virgin who is almost 30 and it's not so much the raw sex he desires, it's the feeling of having a companio
            |, someone told hold, touch, etc - and of course sex as well, but it's the whole package. He can't find it though an
            | it's really getting to him badly.


            |You said women dont just exist as objects to stick your dick in, yet you advocated him paying for it...////:/


                |He's saying, don't put the pussy on a pedestal.


                |You can definitely pay for sex without thinking of the sex worker (or women in general) as an object. It's actu
                |lly kind of offensive to sex workers as professionals that you'd equate what they do with being objects.


                    |I dont equate what they do with being objects, not at all. I just think its cringeworthy as fuck for a guy 
                    |or even worse, a girl) to pay for it their first time. You can't even bring it up in conversation because i
                    |s like yeah, you had to PAY for someone to fuck you.////Its just my opinion, but to me, paying for it is th
                    | easy way out. 


                        |Is is better to say "nobody will fuck me" than to say "nobody will fuck me unless I pay for it"? You're
                        |still unable to attract a sex partner. It's the reality for some people and shaming them by calling it 
                        |ringe-worthy does nothing for their self esteem and insecurities.


        |Dude. Firstly life doesn't suck. What's most important is making the best of what you DO have, and also what you HAVE e
        |perienced. Secondly you need to drop that negative attitude, because that could be the problem. Shitty attitudes are ba
        |ically the biggest turn off regardless of gender.////You'll get what you need. You WILL find someone you want, who want
        | you, but only if you let it happen. You're going to hold yourself back with that attitude. Trust me, I've been there. 
        |aybe not in the same sense, but I've gone through a lot of crap myself, and BELIEVE ME if you let it eat away at you, y
        |u'll stay bitter and nobody will want to in involved with you at all.////You are in control, nobody else. And it's take
        | me years to realize that. I've been homeless, I've been poor, hungry, and extremely close to suicide a few times in my
        |life. But mostly, I've been fucking BITTER. It's time to let go and love yourself. Tell yourself EVERY DAMN DAY "I dese
        |ve to be happy, I deserve what I want". And that's absolutely true as long as those things don't bring harm upon others
        |or yourself of course.////Bottom line: Let it come to you. Drop the negative attitude and it will, I'm speaking from ex
        |erience. I have no way of proving that to you, but I wouldn't waste my time posting this if I had nothing good to say. 
        |lease, for the sake of yourself, those around you, and those who will be around you in the future... Stick up for yours
        |lf and get what you deserve.////TL;DR: Drop the shitty mentality and happiness will come. You're in charge, nobody else


            |From experience, telling someone that thinks they are worth nothing that they just need an attitude change and need
            |to decide they are worth something normally doesn't work.  It's taken decades for people to wear me down and convin
            |e me that fertilizer is worth more than myself, you can't all of a sudden flick a switch and change that.  I imagin
            | VI is in the same position.////Of course, then because you think you are worthless, you never get any, which makes
            |you think you are more worthless, which hinders you from getting any, which makes.... see how this keeps going?


                |I know it takes time, and I'm glad you've gotten to a better point in your life even if it did take decades. It
                |s just that seeing someone so fucking down and out makes me want to say "Stop doing this to yourself, it gets b
                |tter. Make it happen."//


            |Fuck the let it come to you mentality. It doesn't happen. For the truly decent human beings in this world, women ha
            |e been trained to ignore the decent guys.////I waited for years and years for the right personto come along. That d
            |dn't happen. What happened is a crazy found me and ripped my heart out. Life does suck for those who care. The only
            |way to getting laid is a fucking bigoted attitude and it is you fucking assholes who make it almost impossible for 
            |eople who actually care about more than sex to find someone.////Go die under a rock.


                |This basically proves my point. I'm not saying it magically happens, I'm saying it's the attitude, and approach
                |you have in life that will get you what you want. I know I won't die under a rock, because I've crawled out fro
                | underneath it. All I see here is someone bitter, and I honestly hope some good things happen for you dude.


            |Only a person who has never been in a similar situation can say something like this. I know your intentions are goo
            |, and maybe you did turn your live around from being on the verge of committing suicide, but if you think this woul
            | help then you are very disconnected from your old suicidal self. As someone in this position right now let me just
            |say i loath this type of approach or whatever you call it. On one level its condescending, and on the other it just
            |makes me feel like more of a fuck up. Again I know you didn't mean for it to have this impact, but this is how i to
            |k it. Lastly this "You WILL find someone you want, who wants you, but only if you let it happen." seems like such b
            |llshit. Ive been waiting 18 years for someone to want me like that and on the few occasions someone did i fucked it
            |up very quickly.


                |It may seem like bullshit, man... But what I needed was a kick in the ass and to stop feeling sorry for myself 
                |o get things rolling in my life again. Maybe I'm not a virgin, doesn't change that life is about the attitude y
                |u hold towards it. You "fucking up" the good thing you mentioned is your fault, and I'm sure you know that and 
                |ish you hadn't. Doesn't mean it didn't come. Keeping a positive mental attitude will get you places. Consider i
                |.


        |Up vote because this is exactly the post we all came here to see.////Have you considered that maybe you're just not a p
        |ople person? There's nobody in the world who just *cant* get laid. Theres so many desperate ugly girls out there, prost

    |Well...its at least embarrassing enough for me to create a throwaway. The most frustrating part of being a virgin,for me at
    |least,is THERES NO REASON FOR IT. Seriously....I am down to fuck. It never happened in  high school because I live in the b
    |ble belt and girls were weird..many of them thought sex was something that would cause them to burn in hell. I've had a few
    |opportunities since then,but the older I got the more the lack of experience led to lack of confidence and I wound up being
    |the socially awkward penguin who was forever friend-zoned. Now at 37 I find myself with almost no options...I work all the 
    |ime and theres no one in the workplace I want to be in a relationship with. I am obsessed with porn and masturbation as it 
    |s my only outlet for sexual release. At this point I feel like I have so much baggage theres no way I could ever be in a "n

        |You shouldn't worry about being in a "normal" relationship, because there isn't one. Everyone is a weird person. You ma

    |Right, so, fair warning: this doesn't answer the question at all. But I'm a bit drunk and I know what it's like to be a "So
    | wait, how old are you again? Jesus..." virgin and I know that when I was one, I read everything that had to do with virgin
    |ty or other people's experiences on the subject. So I hope this helps someone.////I was 24 when I had my first kiss. Yeah. 
    |t took a goddamn while to even start with that. The biggest thing that I learned too late is that anxiety about what you ha
    |en't done is just about the stupidest thing to think ever. If you have no experience, you're golden; you can learn unabated
    |by bad habits and unburdened by the pressure to perform. And if you're a highly analytical cunt like me and need a bit more
    |instruction than just 'do what comes naturally': Read! Watch educational videos! I swear to fuck I'm not just being an ass,
    |my first sexual experience was with a great woman who had almost a decade of experience above my own and she asked me durin
    | "Are you sure this is your first time?".//Sure it was a nice compliment, but honestly, I was absolutely copying some of th
    | things I had seen in some James Deen porns. Specifically Stoya with James Deen. Look that shit up and do your best.////And
    |if the problem is you just can't find anyone to get into 'that situation' with, a huge help to me was to just start saying 
    |yes'. //Lunch on a Thursday afternoon with a few friends, but you have to work in a few hours and it might make you late so
    |you probably shouldn't?//Fuck you and your probablys, 20 year old me! Go to that lunch and meet some people. Chat with the 
    |aitress about what a nice day it is. Make future plans with said new people and you be the organizer.////I fully expected t
    | be a virgin well into my 40s and 50s. So far I've only had one partner (we dated for a few months), but I'm damned glad I 
    |aited and had a primary sexual experience that was healthy, fun and that we both enjoyed. I have no desire to go out and be
    |one of those guys who tries desperately to get laid on a weekend. Who the shit cares about numbers besides characters in si
    |coms and those four douchetwatters from that MTV pick up show? Find someone you like who interests you, try and get them in
    |erested in you too. And if it doesn't work out, rinse and repeat.//


        |Great, great response. It's right on point, but here are some things to keep in mind: Yes, you're correct in saying tha
        | anxiety over this is a silly thing, but your mind will play tricks on yourself. You (or anyone at any age) can keep re
        |ssuring yourself with "I know it's stupid and silly to be anxious about being a virgin, about not being intimate." But 
        |ven a single inkling of doubt can creep in and take over and begin a spiral of rumination.////It can be difficult to tr
        |ly block out those thoughts, especially in down times ("I sure wish I could cuddle with someone right now. There must b
        | something wrong about me...no I know that's not the case, but maybe it is...").////And yeah, totally agree with you on
        |not being one of those people who goes out trying to get laid every weekend. But here's the problem for most everyone e
        |se: going out to bars on the weekends might be the only "fun" thing to do in certain towns across the world. I'd be the
        |first person to sign up for an alternative to sitting around in your apartment on a Friday/Saturday night, but many tim
        |s that's just not the case. Or at least it's not so clear and easy to find. If one is happy sitting in and playing vide
        | games or watching movies, then great. In fact, ideally you'd be able to find that person or group of people who want t
        | do the same as an alternative to drinking and being silly -- but where do you find those people?////The biggest thing:
        |pursue your interests/passions -- ones that you enjoy doing independently. Or ones you'd like to learn more about that 
        |ould be of interest to a member of the opposite sex. If it's art/hiking/writing/music, then think of places/opportuniti
        |s to where groups might meet, or form your own. Chances are you'll find others with common interests and a higher chanc
        | for meeting a potential hookup/significant other.////Also: *TRY* to ignore outside voices and focus on improving YOU.

        |Pay for it if this is holding you back. If you feel that you struggle with women because you have a secret or what they
        |may think. Realisticly sex isn't a big deal. If the obstacle isn't virginity then whatever.. its about happiness. If pa
        |ing for sex once gives you confidence then it isn't desperate, its doing youself a favor.


            |Honestly, just do this. If you are worried about the legalities - take a trip to Nevada or the Netherlands. Have en
            |ugh sex that it isn't as big of an issue anymore. This might be once, this might be 5 times or more, who knows. But
            |just go, get it done and move on. Think of it as "etiquette class" or something. ////Sex is a PART of a relationshi
            |, not the relationship. Paying for sex isn't "desperate" if the other choice you have is dying alone. 


        |Have you thought about dropping the fleshlight? I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with masturbation, but I wo
        |ld argue that it makes ones sex drive lesser (some think otherwise, but I would argue that they are wrong). If you are 
        |nterested, check /r/NoFap. Remember that if you've done something for a decade and it hasn't worked out, you are probab
        |y doing something wrong.////Also, there is nothing wrong in paying. There's a lot of cultural differences on how prosti

        |Paying for it is not some desperate solution. Paying for it has been going on for millenia.


            |Uh. How are those mutually exclusive?


            |Yeah. Everyone pays for it in one way or another.

        |stitution is risky and dehumanizing for everyone involved.  It *is* kind of annoying to have everyone assume that I mus

    |Most of the posts here seem to be coming from men, so for a change, I'm a **37-year-old woman** that has never had a sexual
    |relationship. To be more precise, who has never had any romantic relationship. ////I am obese, and that turns many men off,
    |and the few that were interested, I wasn't interested in so much that I would start a relationship with. ////I love sex, I

    |rginity affect your life? ////It doesn't really affect my life in a way that being a virgin prevents me from living it, but
    |perhaps I would be more open towards men and towards just finding sex for fun. I tried once or twice when I was younger to 
    |ust find someone to have sex with and lose my virginity, but I chickened out before anything could happen. I don't know why
    | perhaps because deep down I want intimacy and not a quickie, especially when I'm about to lose my virginity officially.///
    |&gt; How many people know about it? ////I have never talked about it with someone, at least not for years. It might be that

    | of me and just lets me wish for the sofa and chocolate when I come home. And yes, I'm lazy and have created a comfortable

        |&gt; I am obese, and that turns many men off, and the few that were interested, I wasn't interested in so much that I w
        |uld start a relationship with.////Unfortunately this goes both ways. People you are attracted to you don't reciprocate,
        |and those who are attracted to you, aren't. 


            |That's life.


                |Unfortunately, yes.


            |I hate it when that happens. 


        |I am more interested in your job it sounds like it consumes you and leaves with little energy for fun - everyone says w
        |rk-life balance, just my op but more life less work may be a improvement for you


        |Thanks for sharing your side.  People often break us down to genders, but we are all human.  I hope you find happiness 
        |n who you are.  The rest doesn't really matter anyway.


        |&gt; Yes, I am somewhat ashamed of it, since I know that if I made an effort, lost (a lot of) weight and were more outg
        |ing and flirty, I would probably find a partner. ////I have no idea how heavy you actually are, obviously, but you prob
        |bly wouldn't need to change as much as you think. Not all men like the conventionally attractive thin girl; I guess it'
        | a problem only if that's who you are trying to attract. ////You sound really content in your life as it is, but if you
        |did want to try making little changes in your life to maybe attract a partner, I would recommend /r/makeupaddiction ove
        | any of the weight loss subreddits. I've learned a lot of tips to make the most of what I've got, without trying to be 
        |omething that I'm not. ////But if you're happy, you're happy!


        |Since you claim that you're ashamed, lazy, overweight, and not "relationship compatible" whatever that means, I'm guess
        |ng that you're not as happy with your comfortable lifestyle as you come across. If that's true, and I don't know if it 
        |s, but if you're not truly happy with your current life, change it. You don't have to lose a ton of weight to be attrac
        |ive to the opposite sex, but you do have to be confident and relatable. ////I had a job that drained my energy and made
        |me want to come home and sit on the couch and eat chocolate and play video games. And I was satisfied with that in a se
        |se. But when I was honest with myself, I knew I wanted more. And as I filled up my after work schedule with random acti
        |ities that I thought I'd never have the energy to perform, I gained more energy. And slowly but surely, I was able to b
        | more honest with myself and gained the strength and courage to pursue the things that actually mattered to me-- things
        |that made me happy, not superficially satisfied.////My method doesn't have to be your method. But if you're not happy, 
        |ou've got nothing to lose by making a change. You can always go back if the change turns out bad. 


        |Eh. I'm a closet slut. Asian society doesn't believe in premarital sex. I believe it all boils down to what you want. O
        |ly you decide. Good on ya for knowing exactly what you want.


        |Anyone who tells you to just go lose weight can suck it. Be happy with who you are. Even though your job is stressful I
        |would still recommend trying to get out. Sure, you might not meet a partner, but there are some amazing people out ther
        |! Best of luck. Thanks fir sharing :)

                    |shut up troll


                    |Use of the word 'troll' become just more honest. you remember how the original meaning was "someone who's m
                    |king a scene for sake of it, for da attention"? So when we say someone's a troll it was like  "I don't like
                    |your comment. I will just assume that you made that comment for attention" except how can I know for sure t
                    |at the alleged troll made that comment for attention? The alleged troll could genuinely have his unpopular 
                    |pinion, right? but there's something very uncomfortable about acknowledging the reality that some people ca
                    | have opinions that I disapprove so strongly. Change of the meaning was to come eventually and it was inevi
                    |able.

                        |What? That guy wasn't a troll, he was making a joke.


                |That's not what "troll" means. He made a joke. Trolling is trying to make people angry or upset because you're 
                |o frightened and weak in your life that you can't get attention any other way

    |Not 40 yet (33) but its extremely hard, especially in our media centric world, seeing people happy, kissing etc.  To afraid
    |of STD to pay for it, even if I did have the funds, plus I know I am gonna like it and if I paid for it would be like getti

    |friends I had all got married had kids and moved away, so now I have no support from anyone, and never was a bar or group k

        |Almost all common STD's are merely severe annoyances. Most are difficult for a man to get through protected sex or oral

                |Asexuality is often linked to a number of disorders, including some that are life threatening. If you are consi

                        |There are a few types of cancer that present with asexuality as a symptom. It's more common in men than
                        |women, but it's still worth having checked out. 


                    |People who are asexual have been asexual their entire life; people who suddenly lose their sexual urges are
                    |not asexual, there's a big difference between those two things. I've never heard of asexuality being 'linke
                    |' with anything disease wise, so if you have any legit sources that would be interesting to see. 


                        |There issue is that there is no officially recognized definition of asexuality, nor is their consensus 
                        |ithin the medical community regarding it as a sexual preference. The current standard for HSDD requires

                        |a sudden loss of sex drive is immediately more concerning, anyone self identifying as asexual due to a 
                        |ack of sex drive should always start with a medical workup to rule out potential disorders, such as [pi

                    |What if it's neither? What if all tests come back clear and you aren't asexual or at least don't identify a

        |There's a [u/ferretbrothel](http://www.reddit.com/user/ferretbrothel) somewhere in this thread, maybe you should check 
        |t out.


        |stop fapping and u get ur urge


        |Huh, I'm a 27 male version of this. I've had super attractive women hot and heavy with me when I was a DD with friends,
        |felt nothing, and with a completely straight face said: "You should get a breath mint. You might have better luck."////


    |28 YO. I'm open about it on Reddit. Not much elsewhere. I started feeling ashamed of it about a year ago. The worst part is
    |that I feel like a part of my youth is missing, I never got to do any wild sex things and that makes me really jealous. I'd
    |also like to point out that it gets worse as I get older. The reason: when you're a teen, being a virgin is okay because no
    |one really knows what the fuck they are doing, but being with someone in their late twenties, they expect their partners to
    |know how to please. Or at least, that's my general perception of things, which is probably way off, considering.////Why I'm
    |a virgin? I don't know how to flirt without sounding creepy. I guess that's it. Honestly rating myself, I'd say I'm a solid
    |6/10, although I would probably bring myself up to an 8 if I worked out a little more. I'm not completely socially inept, b
    |t I do occasionally make social gaffes that cause me a lot of humiliation

        |32 YO checking in. Most people who claim to have had wild sex in their youth are dirty liars. They might have had easy,
        |enjoyable sex with other younger people in their youth, possibly even a lot of it, but I will tell you that no few if a
        |y people under the age of 25 has had super awesome wild, hot, experienced sex. ////As you get older, people (women in m
        | experience, but I am sure guys are similar) get more confident, more skilled, smarter, and generally more likely to gi
        |e you the time of your fucking life if you have the same goals at the time. Teenagers straight up do cosmo shit. If the
        | can barely drink, they are pretty damn likely to just be a dead fish or give you bad oral. About mid-20s is where they
        |know how to please someone and are willing to do it. More eye contact, more (effective) dirty talk, more willingness to
        |try different things based on what they do like and what porn they have been exposed to. ////I still tend to date mid-2
        |s because that's the maturity level I seem to be stuck at. I had a couple of regular hookups over the years that were i
        | their mid-40s. Holy dear god, they knew exactly what to do to my boyparts and were enthusiastic to do them just becaus
        | they enjoyed watching me get off. They also both had good commentary and were fucking incredibly straight to the point
        |and told me EXACTLY what they liked and expected. They both knew how to put on a show, they both found insane new words
        |to whisper in my ear to get a better performance out of me. My previous girlfriend was in her thirties and she was simi
        |arly better than I was used to. She even managed to turn me on to something new and kinda hot because she liked doing i
        |. ////It's like any other human interaction, confidence is one of the most important things you can bring to the table;
        |followed by honesty and integrity and intelligence. There are tons of posts on reddit, likely ones you have seen talkin
        | about the theory that if you are single and looking, you should just be out DOING things. Expand your circle of friend
        |, find new people who might share your orientation and desires. Just relax man and wait for it. You might completely lu
        |k out, meet someone in his/her mid-30s who is cruising for a new relationship or distraction, thinks it's cute you are 
        | virgin and you might get the fucking oral of your life. It won't change you that much, you just might slowly start to 
        |earn the clues and understand how the interactions work and get more comfortable with it. ////All you can do is try and
        |good things will happen. 


            |How many women seriously think it's cute that you're a virgin? I thought that was the kind of thing that would driv
            | people away.


                |From my experience, it does drive people away.  But that could just be me.


                |I think it depends on the person. I had a boyfriend who was 25 and still a virgin, which is kind of old by most
                |standards, it didn't bother me at all. I remember thinking it was kind of endearing


            |&gt; Most people who claim to have had wild sex in their youth are dirty liars. ////Speak for yourself, bro.


                |Totally agree...old and slow now but once I was young and wild//


            |No they are not


        |Most people completely stink at sex, so I wouldn't worry about that. //Socially awkward - the sooner you realize no one
        |is watching you in particular and moreover no one cares if you make a gaffe or 2 the better//


        |i think people need to to get this conception of " pleasing" someone. i mean you just stick your dick in and go in and 
        |ut...dont worry about trying to please someone too much or else you will psych yourself out. having sex is a fucking ev
        |lutionary device..its a natural process that even monkeys just inherently know how to do. ull be fine good luck.


        |Being jealous and bitter will get you absolutely nowhere. You're not entitled to a dirty hot sex life.////As a general 
        |ule, that's the exact attitude that would make me incredibly wary of dating a virgin. I couldn't care less that a guy i
        |n't experienced - fuck, taking someone's virginity would be incredibly fun (how often do you get that kind of chance to
        |*blow someone's mind*?). But as someone in their early twenties who's done some reasonably wild sexual stuff, the idea 
        |f a guy who'd be bitter and feel all entitled to that / jealous and petty because he didn't get all of it or he didn't 
        |et it as soon as he wanted is a really huge turn off.////I like getting wild. I want a partner I can have threesomes wi
        |h sometimes. I want a partner who likes to dress up and go to lingerie parties and play strip Jenga and have public-ish
        |sex. But I am not interested in someone who's going to feel entitled to any of that, or pissed because, say, I realised
        |in the past that I don't like anal and I'm not keen to do it again.////Seriously, your kind of attitude ruins it for vi

    |I'm far from 40 (24/f) but I have had not sexual or intimate contact of any kind. I've never kissed a guy or held hands wit
    | a guy. I would say that my virginity affects me less now than it did earlier. I tell people anyway. I'm not afraid if peop
    |e know I am a virgin its just a fact of who I am. I am a little ashamed but not too much. I get really horny sometimes like
    |on an epic scale its ridiculous. And when I am so super horny i get very frustrated and upset because absolutely no one wan
    |s me. I know its because compared to others I am extremely ugly. And its times like that when I just like wish I had not se
    |ual feelings whatsoever. I just want to wake up sometimes and not be attracted to anyone and have no sexual drive and desir
    | to be in a relationship. I feel that one day that will happen and the longer without a relationship the more I hope that h
    |ppens. But I'm also scared to cross that threshold of never wanting to be a relationship ever. What really frustrates me is
    |that people subscribe to the complete myth that all girls can get it if they just say do you want to have sex with me. It f
    |ustrates me in 2 ways, one because i feel it isn't true if I cant get a guy and it frustrates me in a different way because
    |it just confirms that I am so disgustingly ugly that no one wants me. I guess I have to resign myself to the fact that if a
    |solutely nothing has happened to me now then it never ever will.


        |I'm not sure if you want advice, but you're getting some. At 24, you still have plenty of time to find a guy. There is 
        |ressure to be sexually active due to society, media, blah blah blah, but it is seriously overrated. Lets pretend you ar
        | "ugly", that will not stop a genuine, good guy from dating you. Be thankful for your sex drive. It'll come in handy wh
        |n you do eventually find that guy.////On another note, go get your hair done in a fancy hair salon. Save up if you have
        |to. Get it cut and colored to suit your face. If you have extra cash, get a nice outfit after your haircut. It's shallo
        | and might seem silly, but it's amazing what a change like that can do for your confidence!

                |h a guy who I thought liked me, but just wanted to boast to his friends that he fucked me. As an insecure young
                |girl, this is killing for your self confidence and this upset me more than the years of not having any sexual i
                |tercourse.////What I've realised is that I needed to take a step back from my life and learn to set limits. And
                |yes, up my confidence. Been taken advantage of is a path you don't want to take.////I don't know how your life 
                |as been the past few years, but perhaps you've been able to stand up for yourself. Keep doing this. Don't give

                |tion is. I've been able to regain myself a bit and my skin feels good, I leaned to use foundation. People think
                |I'm hard to approach but that's fine. I choose who to approach, this isn't the 1800's.


                |You're not ugly.  There's no such thing.  There are people out there who will find you beautiful no matter what
                |you may think about yourself.  People like all different sorts of things when it comes to what they find attrac
                |ive.  I promise you this.  We are all our own worst critics.


                    |Thanks but I have yet to see a person that really like someone for other than their looks. I just feel that
                    |things like that only happens in TV shows and rom-com movies.


                        |There are plenty of shallow, superficial people out there, I agree.  But guys are into all sorts of dif
                        |erent things.  Some guys like thin girls, some guys think they're disgusting.  There's guys with black,
                        |asian, white, hispanic, hell, even my little pony (this is Reddit) fetishes.  You name it, someone out 
                        |here is turned on by it.  The people on Maury having DNA tests to find out the father of their baby are
                        |'t usually "conventionally attractive", and they find no shortage of people who want to fuck them.////T
                        | shows and movies are ridiculous.  Relationships are tough and they just gloss over that fact.////I kno
                        | many people who work in the sex industry.  Maybe that discredits me but if there's one thing I've lear
                        |ed it's that there's always someone who will find you attractive no matter what you look like.  Look at
                        |all the weird types of porn out there.////I'm some random internet person but I absolutely promise you 
                        |hat there is no such thing as ugly.  Be good to yourself; you're worth it.


                            |Thank you for the kind words//


                    |You are strange, of course there are ugly people - we have got a set of norms and we all judge - get real//


                |&gt;I've always been led to believe that guys will go for girls for their looks initially and then go for the p
                |rsonality.////You can get to know people before meeting them in the age of the internet. Changes are, if the pe
                |son is interested in getting to know someone before actually meeting them, they are not a shallow person.


            |Believe my there is such a thing as ugly. I'm female, 21, a virgin and not overweight, but I'm happy when people re
            |ognise me as female, and I used to get bullied about looking like a witch when I was in school. There are other una
            |tractive qualities about people that aren't related to weight.


                |Aw don't say that. People in highschool are stupid anyway. It can be very attractive to have a quite androgynou
                | look. It's all about what you make it. Some of the coolest people i know are not confirm with the standard bea
                |ty look and all of then got laid.

                |Exactly, there are ugly people in this world. I see them every day with partners and children living life and b

                    |I've only seen a couple ugly people that were not permavirgins and they always either have some sort of ama
                    |ing talent to make up for their ugliness, or they're being cheated on openly. ////Most of the time when peo
                    |le say they see someone who is ugly and in a relationship, though, it turns out that the guy they're referr

                    |e. 


                |Honestly, just fucking kill yourself then. People of all shapes, looks, etc find partners. Your own ugliness is
                |just based on your reflection of what you've been told is beauty. ////The world doesn't need any more negativit
                | or shitty people reenforcing a flawed societal outlook. So just go save us all your self pity and bitching and

                    |ugliness is a set of visual traits I possess coupled with the reaction they invite in other people. The rea

                        | and you have to interject with your parasitic attitude. You don't tell kids struggling with self image
                        |that "actually, you probably are ugly". Just stop it. You're a sick human.////At least you know what yo
                        |'re doing. Polluting. 


        |It's never too late to be the person you might've been.////While obviously it's not on a plate for all women, it is pro
        |ably strictly speaking easier for women than men to engage in sexual activity. Life is strange and I think you will eve
        |tually find someone who likes you for who you are and what you can bring to the table. I doubt you're really disgusting
        |y ugly, I think you just have a few hurdles in terms of your self confidence to try and scale to make yourself open to 
        |he chances that are out there.////Good luck.


            |But I don't know how its more easier for women I don't see it myself personally and for other women who find it eas
            |er to engage in sexual activity are the pretty ones. I am probably frustrating you but I think while there is the p
            |ysical factor for me the biggest hurdle are my emotions and my low self esteem. I can try to become a better person
            |but I have to be honest I don't think I will be good enough


                |Well, men have the real onus of having to put themselves out there, whereas typically women just have to be ope
                | and reciprocate when it finally happens. That does make it sort of a waiting game for you, so if you're not in
                |o that, you can always subvert it entirely and try asking guys you like to hang out with you - You might be sur
                |rised how many guys really like and appreciate that.////I understand what it feels like to feel like you're not
                |good enough for anyone. I feel it pretty much every day - It doesn't help that I know from the past I can find 
                |t quite easy to make friends, and talk intimately with people online - It makes me feel like I must be repulsiv
                | IRL so I need to lose the barrier of people being able to see me.////The truth is, though - The real barrier i
                | me. I am a coward and I don't put myself out there because I feel like I'm made of glass and that every reject
                |on could be the thing that pushes me over the edge into suicidal.////Self-esteem comes from within - It has to.
                |It is a deeply personal battle we all face, and it is never too late to win it. I still haven't, but I hope to 
                |ne day. I hope you do too.


        |I bet you're much prettier than you think. A year ago I was a 3/10. Chubby, too much facial hair for a girl and to make
        |things worse I was also really insecure and socially awkward.//I started loosing weight, plucking my eyebrows, waxing m
        | moustache and talking to people. Now I'd consider myself a 6/10 and I'm going on my first date today.//Also my mums ne
        | husband is really not what you'd consider attractive, but he's one of the nicest people I know, and my mum's really ha
        |py with him. Don't underestimate the importance of personality.//So don't worry, I'm sure there's somebody out there fo
        | you :)//


            |I understand about the hair thing I have PCOS so that unfortunately means extra hair. I guess I could try all the e
            |tra things bu I think its more in my head more than anything but I'm not discounting how ugly I am. 


                |It sure is a mental thing. Just try to convince yourself that you're awesome and look great. I once met a rando
                | woman who told me something like: "Always tell yourself I'm the greatest, best and most beautiful girl. Otherw
                |se you won't get anywhere in life." And it really worked. Act confident and smile. It may be hard at first, but
                |it makes one hell of a difference.


        |I have known girls that 'were not lookers' as you might say but, funnily enough, once you get to know them it is the in
        |er self that shines through and they actually look more attractive. Just get to know people in a non-sexual way with no
        |relationship pressure. Be confident in yourself and see what transpires. I am sure you are a lot better looking than so
        |e of the girls I have known.


            |Well when it comes to me and guys even in the rare chance I get to interact with them I am always the friend becaus
            | I feel that my looks put them off so much. I can be social just fine but most of the time for me it is a well cons
            |ructed public persona so that people don't know how low my self esteem really is 


                |So that is the nub of the problem - it is not really your looks but your confidence and self esteem.////I know 
                |t is easy for me to sit here and say '***Just believe in yourself and be confident***' and it is far harder to 
                |o. ////Depending on how bad you are you might be able to self help or you may need some support and conciliatin
                |. ////Best of luck ////


        |You never know it's hopeless until you try a bunch of times, and I bet anything in the world you've at best tried a cou
        |le of times with really high-spec guys.


            | I haven't really tried with anyone. I just feel that anyone would be out of my league


                |So how come you're so sure that it's a complete myth that women can get sex and love with the minimal amount of
                |effort?////Oh, right, you're so sure because being sure absolves you of the need to actually take responsibilit
                | for your own fate. So you choose to be sure. To believe. Out of convenience.////Consider this. I'm a 29 year o
                |d guy. I have tried, and I have failed. I too believe that anyone is out of my league. I don't want that to be 
                |rue, but the experience I've accumulated is just too convincing. Don't you think that by choosing this issue as
                |a convenient hiding place, you're being an asshole to those of us who aren't here by choice?////Get out there a
                |d make a fucking effort.


                    |You think I choose to think this way and feel this way. There are days when I can barely look my self in th
                    | mirror because I feel disgusting. And other days I have burning unending rage at anyone in a relationship.
                    |Believe if tomorrow I could magically not feel this way even if i still looked the same I would take it. I 
                    |on't choose to feel this way. It is the way it is


        |Do you think maybe your view of yourself has an impact on the way you approach people? Do you ever approach people? Hav
        | you tried online dating? Give people the chance to get to know you. Rejection is scary as fuck, I know, but it shouldn
        |t stop you from trying. Even if you are ugly as sin (you probably don't look as bad as you think), I know quite a few p
        |ople who are out there being in relationships and making babies, despite their appearance. At 24, you still have a butt
        |oad of time to find the right person!////Check out /r/makeupaddiction too! 


            |I signed up to okcupid the other day but online dating scares me. I feel like i'm already being rejected by hundred

        |Hi I'm 22/f and I sort of... felt exactly like this and I was pretty sure I would never, ever find myself in a relation
        |hip ever because I'm nowhere near good-looking??? I have skin problems and I'm short and overweight etc etc... it wasn'
        | so much of a problem for me because I'd sort of just accepted it as a fact of life and had been trying my best to move
        |on and be happy as a perpetual single person. And then a month ago I met someone who actually genuinely likes me and we
        |spent all of Thursday evening cuddling and if anyone had told me that would have been the case say, six months ago, I w
        |uld have laughed so hard I'd have ruptured something.////Sometimes things happen. I know how it is to feel completely u
        |wanted. But you'll be okay. Just concentrate on loving yourself because that's the most important thing. People will co
        |e to you. :) X


    |Mid-thirties here.  Not quite 40 but for me it's not much of an issue.  Sure I fantasize, look at porn, etc. but sex is abo
    |t as important to me as seeing Machu Picchu.  I would love to go but if I never do my life won't be incomplete.  If I do ge
    | the opportunity then cool, I'll enjoy the experience.////Biologically there's probably something off. Low testosterone or 
    |omething but it doesn't cause me any harm other than being a full stop in my genetic line.  ////I sometimes feel like an ou
    |sider looking in a crazy world.  I see people make some incredibly bad choices just over sex like being a US politician and
    |sending MMS images of your groin. I've known people who become genuinely distressed because they haven't had sex in 7 month
    | and it's driving them crazy.  I don't get it.////*How does it affect my life?*  Well, I have a lot more money given my cur
    |ent income than most people do.  I don't make much but because I am not spending it on anyone but me I have some nice toys.
    |///*How many people know?*  Pretty much anyone that I'm friends with.  Questions about marriage, kids, etc. come up from ti

        |ntimacy more than just some physical experience


        |This intrigues me, as I have a very close friend who's 24 and I think he's only had sex once in his life.  He seems to 
        |ave absolutely no interest in sex or relationships really and as he's certainly not unattractive (and has had female ad
        |irers in the past) it makes my friends and I wonder - even though of course, in reality, it's none of our business.////
        |e had three theories:////* He's asexual, sort of how you describe yourself////* He's a closet homosexual////* He had so
        |e traumatic experience that's made him fear sex//////One of my gay friends "doesn't believe" in asexual beings and inst
        |ad is insistent that this friend is a closet gay.  So I suppose it's interesting to hear from someone who genuinely ide
        |tifies as somewhat asexual.


            |Not quite the same boat but I used to have sex very frequently (//200x or more a year) then came to a naer abrupt h
            |lt when I had a dramatic income increase circa 24. i'm 27 now, most of my friends know im on an extended dry spell.
            |I think tis fair to say im attractive and the chastity is mostly my own doing. Its possible he is closeted but at t
            |e same time there are other reasons men shut down. I cant explain it fully and i know im getting tldr but its a com
            |ination of paranoia, focus and contention for me. Perhaps your friend has the same issues.


            |this pretty much sums up 4 of my 6 main friends. All between 20-21 but have no interest what so ever


            |Just because some conservatives don't believe in gay people doesn't mean your gay friend is imaginary, hon. Trust m
            |, Ace people definitely exist. There may not be a ton of us, but we are very real. ////Or I'm just managing to type
            |from an alternate imaginary plane of existence, whichever one is more believable.


                |Don't get me wrong - I fully believe that, perhaps due to hormonal imbalances, people can be asexual.  It's my 
                |ay friend that denies it's a thing - he's adamant that asexuality is just homosexuality in disguise.  I think h
                |s desire for other people to be gay would probably bias his opinion though.


        |If you have low testosterone then maybe you should get it checked out. How often do you watch porn? If you are doing it
        |on a weekly or daily basis, I'd say you don't have a low sex drive but if you are doing it once a month or so then mayb
        | you do. ////How's your appearance and personality like? Maybe you could change that and be more attractive. ////


            |You're telling him to change himself to achieve something that he doesn't seem very interested in. It would be like

    |RIFIED of the intimacy, of the some nebulous thing that I can't put my finger on. I know my own sexuality is dubious, often
    |waffling between attractions for men and women, and that makes it harder. What if a girl wants to get intimate with me, but
    |I can't find the attraction? What if I really am gay and not just bisexual like I assume? What if, what if, what if... ////
    |t scares the living crap out of me. That's why I'm a 26 year old virgin.


        |IMO you're overthinking it and need to take some action, make some mistakes like the rest of us, but I know it isn't ea
        |y. Thanks for your story and congrats on lookin' good


        |Dude, last year I was in your shoes.  So I started hooking up with guys (let's face it, no one's easier to get in the s
        |ck than a gay guy).  That experience gave me the confidence to not only date guys longer term, but start dating WOMEN a
        | well.////Currently in a fantastic relationship with a great man, and couldn't be happier.  Especially since I finally 
        |ave my bisexuality a chance to prove itself.


        |You have to remember your strong points and sing them like a mantra in your head. You have to push your anxieties into 
        |he shadows and puff your chest out. It takes a huge effort at first..but with the right inner dialogue, confident body 
        |anguage will come easier; after that it is only a matter of timing and some clever flirting. At least that's how I see 
        |t. Good luck my friend. 


        |Congrats on dropping the weight. On the intimacy, your only option is to dive in. ////If a girl or guy wants to get clo
        |e, give it a shot. Absolute worst case, you're not into it and make a bit of a fool of yourself. Not the end of the wor

        |I was in the same sexuality boat when I was figuring things out at 17/18. I'm bisexual but I stressed for a long time o
        |er putting a label on it. What if I'm gay? What if I'm straight? Exact same thoughts as you. You just have to stop stre
        |sing about it and accept that you like what you like! It's a spectrum, so if you're bi you're probably not slap bang in
        |the middle. Maybe you prefer guys, maybe you prefer girls. And for me at least, it's not even a fixed point on the scal
        |! Later in life you might find your preferences change. Hell, sometimes I feel like it changes by the week! And that's 
        |kay!////You can identify as anything you like. Humans are complicated, sexuality's fluid, just be yourself and like who
        |you like! You can call yourself queer, bisexual, whatever you like or just nothing at all. ////Your problems with intim
        |cy are probably linked to this stress over your sexuality. I don't know you, so it might not be the only reason, but at
        |least for me it was a factor. Once you're comfortable with yourself you can relax and like I keep saying, like who you 
        |ike without worrying if they fit into your idea of your sexuality! ////Obviously it's not going to happen overnight. It
        |takes time to retrain your brain like that. Sometimes I still think it would be easier to just be completely straight o
        | gay and not keep flip flopping between degrees of attraction. I joke with my other queer friends that it's time for th
        | quarterly business review of my sexuality :) Maybe you should browse some LGBT forums or find a group near you? It hel
        |s just to be around people who understand what you're going through. ////I'm usually not so good at the advice but hope

    |I'm a wizard! //That's a common misconception. You gain very little from not having sex before you're 40. Biggest thing is 
    | probably think about sex differently. To most people(I assume) sex is a casual thing you do with someone you love. I have 
    |lways seen sex as more of a practical tool, and just told myself I didn't want kids. And I wanted wizarding powers.


        |Not to mention you miss out on the experience of having sex while you're relatively thin and in shape.

                    |I'm thinking he meant to type "25", as in after you're 25 years of age, it's all downhill.  Maybe he meant 
                    |5, 45, or even 50-something.  I'm hoping it's one of those and not 15, or worse, actually 5 with no typo


        |If it's a casual thing it's not with someone you love.  With someone you really actually feel very strongly for like th
        |t it's an expression of how you feel, a very open and honest way of telling them exactly how you feel.  For some people
        |it's the only way to tell their lover how they really feel.  If I wanted to do something casual with a significant othe
        | I'd play checkers or watch TV with them.////Sex in the context of a loving relationship should never be casual.  Light
        |earted, yes.  You should be comfortable with what you're doing, yes.  But to say "casual thing you do" makes it sound l
        |ke going through the motions, which is pretty much invariably a sign that the relationship is not healthy, or at least 
        |ot what you think it is.


            |I disagree. Yes, there can be and often is a purely loving aspect to the act of sex but to say that's all it should
            |be is a bit naive. Our bodies are driven to fulfill instinctual sexual desires. These desires are there whether we 
            |re in a lovey-dovey mood or not. Sure, you probably shouldn't be "just going through the motions" with your signifi
            |ant other but there is no way that doesn't happen despite being in a deep and committed relationship. Having sex, e
            |en with someone you love, is not always a passionate and tender experience that communicates love in some deep and 
            |motional way. That's wishful thinking.


            |I think that what he means by "casual" is "easily obtained"...as in, while you may have to woo your lover a bit, ge
            | them in the mood, that is nothing like the effort that it takes to get sex elsewhere from a willing partner.////tl
            |dr, once you're already in a sexual relationship with someone, having sex with them is less of a big deal (/duh)


            |This was supposed to be virgins sharing their stories, not your sex having peoples place to tell how awesome it is.


            |Isn't the very definition of one night flings at the bar "casual sex"?


                |And are you in love with that person?  I didn't rule out the possibility of casual sex, I just refuted OP's imp
                |ication that all non-procreative sex is casual.

    |No.  But I sometimes wonder if there's something that I've missed.  I wonder if it would be good to finally fit that piece

    |Just 27 years,but figured I'd comment. Its a non issue. I decided to wait till I was married for relious reasons, but at ~2
    | I decided that (since Im not as religous anymore) I would do it simply because "Hell, waited this long. Might as well cont
    |nue." ////My life is no different from anyone elses. I tell as many people as I would share other personal items with. Im n
    |t ashamed of it. Simply a choice. I find it funny though how many times I hear. "oh thats so nice. I wish I waited till I g
    |t married" then know that the shear thought of not getting to have sex scares them. People tend to daydream like they would
    |give candy to a kid, but really they would eat the candy in a heartbeat. //////Oh, in case you were wondering. If I date a 
    |irl, wether she has or hasnt wouldnt have any bearing on if I would ask her to marry me. 


        |&gt;  I find it funny though how many times I hear. "oh thats so nice. I wish I waited till I got married" then know th
        |t the shear thought of not getting to have sex scares them////That's because they're just saying that to be nice. I can
        |honestly say as someone who loves sex and would never date someone who is saving themselves for marriage, I can see mys
        |lf awkwardly saying that to make them feel comfortable. 


            |I used to feel the same way, as a veteran sex-haver. My first time was a lets-just-have-fun acquaintance right afte
            | high school, which was nice. From then I normally dated women my age or older, always of the liberal-minded bent, 
            |o I figured I was never going to wind up with a virgin.////Until I did. I met a recently-returned friend of a frien
            | on a night out and we hit it off. Slept in the same bed and fooled around a little bit, but no sex (other people w
            |re sleeping in the room, for starters). She was pretty confident and smooth, and a pretty decent kisser. I found ou
            | later that she was in her early 20's (I'm in my late 20's). The next week she came over to my place to stay the ni
            |ht with pretty obvious intentions, and as we're getting down to it she asks "Can I tell you something first?" and l
            |oking more than a little embarrassed. Right hand to God, I thought she was going to tell me she had a kid. Quite th
            | contrary. ////I tried to talk her out of it because while she was cute and pretty fun to hang out with, she wasn't
            |really the type I'd date (plus she was moving overseas at the end of the summer). She said she was feeling really w
            |ird about it at her age, all her friends had done it, and wanted the virginity thing out of the way. Had wanted to 
            |or a while in fact, but either she'd liked the guy and he hadn't liked her back, or vice-versa. I still almost told
            |her "no", but I thought back to when I was 18 and remembered feeling the exact same way; I had just-for-fun sex to 
            |ose my virginity and turned out fine, and I'd be a real patronizing shitlord to hold her to a different standard be
            |ause of her gender. ////I was expecting it to be a lot worse than it was, although there was still some awkwardness
            |as I was a virgin-virgin so wasn't entirely sure how to deal with things. None of my friends had ever really talked
            |about deflowering someone, so I was pretty much going by what I remembered from middle school sex-ed and stuff that
            |had come up in novels.////Obviously, I've had much *better* sex, and with people I was much more emotionally involv
            |d with, but fumbling around, watching her go from discomfort to... "oh wow this is what I've been missing?!", and a
            |l that actually turned out to be a really special experience for me, and it gave me pause to reflect on what it'd b
            | like to do that on one's wedding night, with someone you expected to spend your whole life with. Again, probably h
            |lla awkward, but also kinda... magical in a way. Oh god I can't believe I just typed the second half of that senten
            |e. ////I'm not saying it's for me (as if I could unfuck the women I've been with, lol), but it did put the idea of 
            |aiting until marriage/just the right person in a new light, and gave me an appreciation and better understanding of
            |that experience. Whereas previously I'd probably look at a couple who had waited until marriage as well... prudish 
            |humps, now it's more of a "that's not for me, but a small part of me is definitely envious". 


            |No need. Most of us virgins do think about and enjoy the prospect of sex, but might be too socially inept or insecu
            |e to seek it out. Praising us for "saving ourselves" feels more awkward than expressing your own shared interest, e
            |en if actually having experienced it isn't relatable for us. Of course, some people still do believe in saving them
            |elves for marriage or whatever, but not all of us -- I'd wager that's kind of a minority.////Personally, I am insec
            |re and really, really dread the thought of intimacy, or rather, failing to achieve a sense of intimacy with a partn
            |r. So I usually swat down my chances and don't actively seek it out to avoid the anxiety (and the unfairness it mig
            |t cause for a partner if it grows into jealousy or clingy-ness -- granted, I haven't actually been in a relationshi

                |Don't worry, I know there's a large difference between people who are "saving themselves" and people who just h

        |ugh I do in a way wish that he was the only one I'd been with and could just erase all the others I also know that a pa
        |t of the reason I married him was because he was the best I'd ever had.


            |I always wonder though. Is it you cared for him because it was great sex? Or was it great sex because you cared for
            |him? ////Which comes first?


        |If you don't have sex before you're married how will you know if you are sexually compatible?  


            |Married people don't have sex. Quit being ridiculous.


            |Redditors love to over-hype sex and "sexual compatibility." In reality, if two people get together who both waited 
            |nd share the same views, it is highly likely that they will be compatible in their sex life. And even if not, for s
            |meone with such beliefs, sex is not typically a deal-breaker.////There is far and away more to marriage than that a
            |d everyone places their own value on things. What seems like a massive factor to you is not necessarily the same fo
            | everyone else. And it is always a gamble to marry someone. Always.


                |So, you're saying that couple probably won't have too much sex.


                    |It's possible. Maybe neither has a high sex drive. Or maybe they'll have a lot of it. One could be more sex
                    |al than the other. If they got married for the right reasons and are truly, 100% in love, they are open and
                    |honest with one another and communicate their feelings. And with that comes growing, changing, compromising
                    | They will adapt to fit both of their needs.////And just from personal experience, most of my friends who p
                    |ayed the waiting game became freaks after marriage. Just with only their partner. I've had one friend who w
                    |s disappointed in their partner's sex drive but they stayed together and, through that whole process mentio
                    |ed above, fixed it. ////Those of us who chose not to wait it out often face the same issues. People change 
                    |ver time. Or we may be challenged over some other compatibility we didn't foresee. 


                |&gt; In reality, if two people get together who both waited and share the same views, it is highly likely that 
                |hey will be compatible in their sex life////I actually strongly doubt that. 


                    |Sex isn't some magical thing that only works properly when the right two people finally come together. If y
                    |u and your SO give a shit about each other then you'll figure out what each other likes and become sexually
                    |compatible over time, even if you didn't start out that way. 


                        |Absolutely.//I don't have a ton of sexual experience, but I have had a few partners, and with everyone 
                        |ew I have met - I've had to re-learn to make love so that I could please them personally.//With none of
                        |my partners have sex just flat-out NOT worked.//You talk, you learn and you adapt.//


                |Sex is a large part of a relationship that wishes to indulge in sex. If they suppress these urges until marriag
                |, then it becomes difficult when problems in the bedroom stem into real life. And yes, that can and does happen
                | Problems in the bedroom have lead to divorces. It's just one big aspect among many in a relationship, and if n
                |ither are on the same page for the major parts, shit isn't going to work.


                    |My thought was that if two people manage to make it to marriage as virgins, their sex drive is around the s
                    |me level. No, if you're just suppressing your near uncontrollable urges, it's probably not the right path f
                    |r you. But you don't have to be on the same page for everything. Just be within a few pages and work toward
                    | coming together.


                        |I think being on the same page with sex is really important. If you aren't with somebody who will pleas
                        | you in the ways you want and need (sexuality is a big need in a lot of people's lives), then that snow
                        |alls into a big problem. Though it is possible for it to work if both parties are very vanilla about se
                        |, but suppose one is interested in BDSM and the other is not. There's a glaring hole there that could c
                        |use a large aspect of life to go unfulfilled.


                |Exactly. If I am willing to marry someone without having sex, then even if it's bad I know that the original re
                |sons are still there. And if the sex is good. Well thats a plus. Not only that, looking at from her point of vi
                |w. Im basicly a blank slate to mold for however she likes it. 


                    |You have to live your life the way you see fit. Not how reddit thinks you should. I won't lie though, there
                    |s a good amount of risk for you. You might wind up a 40-year-old virgin and, as you can see here in the com
                    |ents, there is nothing worse in the world. Say what you want about Hitler, at least the guy got laid. You m
                    |ght marry someone with different tastes in the bedroom. And again, that will be the immediate end of the ma
                    |riage.////Seriously though, if you marry someone, I'll bet you'll have enough going for you to work togethe
                    | to overcome that obstacle. Just like another couple who didn't wait and were completely sexually in tune w
                    |ll have to face their own. Maybe it will be over children, or finances, or relocating for a job. Perhaps on
                    | day they'll realize all they had in common was the sex. Who knows? There are a lot of pieces to the puzzle
                    |and not everyone is playing with the same ones. 


                        |Nor trying for the same "win conditions" :) , but thank you, You don't make it to this age without thin
                        |ing of the "what if I die first" question. I've made my answer on that and its "its worth the risk" (to
                        |me of course, maybe not everyone)...(definetly not everyone)


                |So, you're a virgin then?


                    |So, you're an asshole then?


                        |That one's a given.


            |Sexual compatibility is a crock of shit.


                |Says people who have never had sex, or at least good sex.


                    |I've had sex with a few women, not a lot by any means, some were better than others. But I cared deeply abo
                    |t them, and at the time it was all the same. Had I been with the one who was bad longer I'm sure it would h
                    |ve gotten better. But we were room mates, and I moved shortly after our relationship started. Even though i
                    | wasn't the greatest, we still had sex because I like her a lot and it didn't change my opinion of her. Not
                    |once did I think in any relationship about "compatibility" because when you love someone you don't give a f
                    |ck.


            |To be cynical, we may not be, but if we are not, the reasons for marriage are still there.


            |Exactly! It's like buying a car without test driving it!


            |How do you know you are sexually incompatible?


                |Well, without testing the waters it's a gamble for sure.


                |If you're married (presumably you took a vow for life), don't you have a lifetime to figure that out? //


                    |Well at least until the divorce. 


                |Is this seriously a question? You're an idiot.


        |Waiting until marriage is actually pretty dumb. Relationship is never complete without sex. Sex is a big part of a rela
        |ionship. You should make sure it's the right one for you when you marry. It's like getting married before living togeth
        |r. You should live together and have sex with someone to know it's the right person to get married with. If you wait, i
        | might work out, but it might as well not.


            |I understand, I hear that alot and I see the sense in it, but thats not what I believe and I've seen enough evidenc
            | to support my belief. If it was so simple an answer than there wouldn't be any discussion over it. Sadly no one ha
            | the golden formula for a perfect marriage. Sex before marriage or not. Neither have great track records nowadays. 
            | simply take action on what my priorities are at this time with my relationships. And should it come to pass that I
            |get divorced because sex is that big a deal, then my beliefs would change for my case and I would act accordingly.


                |You know, I think it's like calculating odds. Odds that a complete stranger is the right person is pretty low. 
                |ut the odds that the person you have happily lived together is the right one is pretty damn high.


                    |I agree. Living with someone would increase the odds, but for me would be that if I slept with someone I wa
                    |n't married to (I say married to because you can never be 100% sure of marriage prior to the act) it would 
                    |efeat the purpose of why Im waiting. For me that reason is more important than actually having sex. It stil
                    | may all go to shit, but since did, am doing, what I am for a reason I fully believe in I have no regrets. 
                    |t's important to me enough to accept the lesser odds for the chance of that bond with someone you wont have
                    |with anyone else. I know its stupid but it's not so easy to no longer care about a concept that youve held 
                    |ll your life.  Long odds or no.

                        |ean without me explaining.


        |I've never met anyone who wished they waited.  You only have so many years on this planet.  Don't waste any of them avo
        |ding the greatest biological function!


            |Breathing and pooping are pretty good too, though


            |I don't see it as wasting time when considering the reasons Im doing the waiting. Odd perhaps, but they are still m
            | reasons, and I care about those reasons.


        |&gt; My life is no different from anyone elses.////You can't really know that.


            |I suppose so, but then the question wouldnt be fair in the first place. Why ask if I don't have all the evidence. 


        |Same thing happened to me (religious until I was 21) and just decided to keep waiting since that's all I knew.////To go
        |with your candy analogy, for me it was like being allowed in a candy shop after never being allowed in one. What is the
        |mating protocol? I knew it wasn't going to be the way it was portrayed in Hollywood or TV. How does one properly acquir
        | such candy? So I stayed out of the candy shop until some nice young lady/candy shop owner showed me the way.////That w
        |s a terrible analogy. I'm sorry. However, yeah, I know how ya feel man. You can't really miss or desire what you've nev
        |r had even if if "sex is no big deal" anymore after you stop being religious.


            |So, if I understand you use of the analogy you married a sex shop owner. lol. But seriously congrats on finding som
            |one that satisfied your sweet tooth.


        |I'm 27 and FA so I'll reply to this one. I will be a 40+ virgin if I live that long. I've accepted it. Just like most p
        |ople have accepted that they won't ever fly or go to the moon. There are some things that are just not possible.


        |Similar situation as yours. But I'm waiting until I find someone that I feel I'm compatible with, and if they wish to w
        |it until marriage, I wouldn't mind either.


        |&gt; I find it funny though how many times I hear. "oh thats so nice. I wish I waited till I got married" then know tha
        | the shear thought of not getting to have sex scares them.////Um no, they're just being polite. I would've said somethi
        |g along those lines to you but I absolutely would not have meant it.


        |do you bash your one eyed bald bishop


            |Yes, I do. The line is at sex. To me sex is about the connection to another person. Thats the important part for me
            | So, Jill and Palmala are just a fun time. 


                |I really don't mean to be offensive here, this is an honest question: Why do you feel qualified to say what the
                |most important part of sex is to you without ever having experienced it?


                    |The meaning is in the belief.  So when/if I have sex the "whats it all about" will be what i understand it 
                    |o be because I put that weight on it to make it so. ////


                |I want to preface and say this is not an attack on you, just an inquiry into your thinking about sex; ////How w
                |uld a virgin know what the act of sex truly feels and means to them if they've never done it? I think of person
                |who says "To me dancing is about the connection to a piece of music," and they have never heard a piece of musi
                | they liked, or even a piece of music at all. ////You say you need 'connection to another person'... Have you n
                |t had a significant relationship since you became non religious?////Do you think saving yourself until marriage
                |is going to impress or benefit your relationship with your future significant other? What if after getting marr
                |ed, you have sex for the first time and it's awful and one of you loses attraction? 


                    |No offence taken. ////How does sex feel? I dont know. However, with the girls I've been sexual with (not se
                    |), the more I cared the better it was. And it may mean nothing to her, but it would to me since (with luck)
                    |it will be the one and only person I've experienced that with.////Which leads me to why I'm waiting till I'
                    | married. I hear of too many stories of people that hit it off and are a "beacon of love". Then they have a
                    |falling out and dont have near the same feelings. I know its against the odds, but I really dont want to ha
                    |e a divorce. ////Yes, I have. In fact if I wasn't stupid and got freaked out I'd probablly be married right
                    |now. But I have trouble getting a long term relationship. Being deployed for 6 months every 1 1/2 years is 
                    |retty hard to work through. ////I have no thoughts of it being immpressive that I waited. However, helping,
                    |Yea, I think it might. It'll be an experience that I've never shared with anyone else. That's a guess at be
                    |t though, obviously. ////If it's bad. From my understanding, every first time is bad and its something you 
                    |ave to practice. Which, since I have no prior experience, all I have to do is ask her what she wants and sh
                    | can help me become it. If all of that fails, then I still have everything that was already there that I lo
                    |ed so much that I decided it was enough to "take the leap", as they say. ////Im not so naive to believe tha
                    | all of this will work or even know what my mindset with sex will be if I get divorced. But as I see it, if
                    |it doesn't work, I did it all with what I believe to be the right reasons and have no regrets. 


                |Serious question: How do you know what it's about if you've never had it?//


                    |Not sure I fully understand the question, but Ill try to answer. ////The meaning is in the belief. With a b
                    |lief any act can be meaningful. So when/if I have sex the "whats it all about" will be what i understand it

        |ys (I graduated at the end of last year) were a bit... different. ////I've always been younger than almost everyone in 
        |y class because I started kindergarten when I was four years old. To add to that, during high school I was always in ad
        |anced classes with people that were typically a year or two ahead of me. To worsen the situation, I was primarily a dua
        | enrollment student so the vast majority of my classes the last two years of high school (16 college, 4 high school) we
        |e at a college, and most of them were online. As a result of all this, there weren't any girls my age to talk to, much 
        |ess date or have sex with. ////In my senior year I had four college courses, and was a TA during the planning period of
        |a freshman English teacher and I worked in the front office of the school answering phones as a "class." This meant tha
        | in my senior year of high school I spent more time with a teacher that was a decade older than I was than I did with a
        |y person my age. ////I received my Associate's in Arts at the age of 17 and it didn't cost me a dime so I don't necessa
        |ily regret my actions, but it did take a toll on my social life to the point where I had no social life. I legitimately
        |became better friends with my freshman English teacher (the one that I was a TA for during senior year) than I did with
        |anyone I graduated with (excluding someone I had been friends with for over a decade at that point). ////It can be a de

        |You poor pathetic, excuse making bastard. Please post a photo of yourself so reddit can see you.


            |It's good to see you haven't lost your manners when you're insulting me.


    |Well this thread is depressing as fuck.

        |If it was accidental, do you still get the powers? What goes around comes around.


            |I believe it should work that way. You've suffered enough whether it was accidental or not. Give the person a damn

    |This thread is kind of depressing. //It's like reading my life 20 years in the future. ////


    |So I don't know if my opinion means much as a 22 year old girl who has a fair amount of sex, but I don't see anything wrong
    |with an older guy being a virgin.  I've gone on a few dates with men over 40 and I don't think them being virgins would hav
    | had that big of an impact on me.  A person is a person. and if you're a good person I'll like you.  ////Also there is some
    |hing kind of hot about the idea of taking an older guys virginity.  I might just be a freak though.  


        |I completely agree! Finding a good guy is so difficult that a small thing like virginity wouldn't change my feelings. A
        |d knowing that I'm a guy's first would be a huge turn on. Nothing better than teaching a guy exactly what you like (and
        |being the dominant one is always fun)

    |Reading this made me very sad. I know this comment will be down the bottom and no one will see it but men everywhere need t
    | know that sex isn't the only way to be close with other humans. Get close with people, cuddle them, hug them, hold hands. 
    |ex is just one way to get close, and you are no less of a man for not having done it.


        |I've never had those either. At least not in a romantic way.


            |I'm not talking about a romantic way. 


        |It's true.   Cuddling for me is more passionate than sex.  It's amazing when it means something.////If you've never had

        |en you see porn, it is just a bunch of trained actors making the situation seem much more intense than what it really i


    |I have a female friend who is 31 and a virgin, and a male friend who is 38 and a virgin. For her, shes a bit 'slow' and was
    |raised in a very sheltered, old fashioned, home so I don't think she has even kissed a boy. For him, he's very aspergers an
    | socially retarded and is more interested in television and alcohol.////Maybe I should introduce them to each other? 


        |I had a socially inept friend who ran in my circle. My group of friends tried to help him lose his virginity by providi
        |g encouragement and introducing him to women whenever we could. He finally meets a girl he likes and they have sex. Sud
        |enly he starts obsessing over her. He tries to continue the relationship but she just wanted to hook up. He started to 
        |eteriorate immediately. It turns out he was socially inept because he was suffering from a mental illness that nobody w
        |s aware of. Within the year he had become an alcoholic and a compulsive spender. He managed to rack up a huge debt and 
        |ropped off the grid. ////You really have to be careful trying to help people who have mental health issues. Sometimes g
        |od intentions can backfire and cause serious problems. 


            |Yep this is why a mutual friend and I haven't done anything to 'help' him in that department. It would end badly fo
            | the guy. He's an okay dude, the aspie in him just does my head in a bit. I want to do more to help him an encourag
            | him to do more with his life, but at the same time it probably wont work or will make things worse. I guess he is 
            |appy where he is in life so I shouldn't be trying to change that.


        |Yep being aspie completely destroys chances of finding sex with most women. And quite honestly as an aspie I wouldn't e
        |en consider making an emotional attatchment (aka sex etc.) with someone who can not keep up with me on some intellectua
        | level.


            |I don't mean to, but I have to ask - do you think women are overall less intelligent than men? because if you do an
            | you sound like you do, you have bigger problems than being an aspie


            |&gt;with me on some intellectual level.////There is a difference between being intelligent and obsessed in obscure 
            |inutia few care about. 


                |Nice straw man.////It's extremely well documented that people with asperger syndrome tend to be of above-averag
                | intelligence.////You both came off as condescending, but statistically speaking he probably has more reason to

        |I smell a new reality show.


        |Honestly it sounds very tacky but I think it would be beneficial for them to meet, not that they need to have sex or an
        |thing but just for the experience of being in a relationship.

            |Don't really think it's a faux pas here. This is the type of context that it's for.


    |You get to a certain point in your life where being a virgin is like, eh, whatever. It sucks, but it just means life doesn'
    | want you to get any. I'm 31, virgin, never been in a relationship, and probably never will. Yet I'm okay with it because I
    |have the most amazing group of friends that anyone could ever ask for, so while I'm lonely in that department, I'm not trul
    | "forever alone". ////I know this is for those 40+, but I figured I'd give my thoughts on this. Accept it and move on. 


    |The funny thing about not getting any is that once you establish a sexual relationship with a woman all other woman would j
    |st jump on you, as if they can smell you're taken and it turns em on


        |I would agree with this. I will find someone mildly attractive, and then as soon as they are dating someone they are so
        |much more appealing


    |38.  Doesn't effect my life at all.  Now, the social awkwardness, the complete isolation, the horrible self-esteem problems
    |that I now recognize cause the ongoing virginity, those affected it incredibly.  I've told people in the past, I don't real
    |y care, I'm not open about it and aren't ashamed of it today.////I got a ton of therapy, I totally understand why I didn't 
    |ose it and why I've only had a handful of very short relationships.  I've now got my self-esteem, I'm doing things for myse
    |f, and working on making my life into awesomeness.  I've got an incredible job, I'm getting outside the apartment and doing
    |interesting things, I'm losing weight and gaining muscle, I'm figuring out how to move to Seattle to be around an interesti
    |g social scene, and I'm pretty sure I'll lose it in the next year.////On the other hand, my 2TB drive is overflowing with p
    |rn and I really need to upgrade for more storage.


        |Awesome dude , keep going your way :) maybe a bit less porn or just stream it haha.


    |I'm 29 and a virgin, and this thread is pretty friggin' depressing. ////Anyway, I think my biological clock is busted, beca
    |se I've never felt the urge to pursue women (or men). But I'm satisfied with just masturbation, so my virginity doesn't rea
    |ly have any affect on me.


    |I'm 23, somewhat attractive(or so I'm told), but isn't social anxiety a sonofabith).
