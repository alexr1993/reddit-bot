Seriously though, where can I buy this copy of 1984?(/r/books)




    |I picked it up [here](http://www.bookdepository.com/Nineteen-Eighty-Four-George-Orwell/9780141393049). 10 dollars, free shi
    |ping.


        |Yeah I've been on the "notify me" email for a while. But sweet, that price does sound nice 


            |"Notify me"? It's showing as in stock. I just added it to basket.


                |... it says out of stock for me. what?! are you in the uk?


        |Always the Book Depository for special editions, because you can usually choose from a number of editions!


        |Free shipping worldwide! No more Barnes and Noble or trips to the UK to get books in English!


            |It's invaluable for me, my native tongue is English but I live in a place where good English books are hard to get 
            |or a good price. Best of all, books don't get toll applied when imported.////There's also Better World Books who wi
            |l ship a BAG of books. I look like Santa or something when I pick up my books at the post office.


                |There are plenty of bestsellers to get here, but all other books I have to order online. Last time I placed a $
                |50 order with barnes and noble because of the shipping fees and everything.////The past few years I've been buy
                |ng them on trips to the UK and mailing them to myself from there, but I look like a moron at the post office. L
                |ke you're smuggling illegal items.


            |if you are european amazon.co.uk does ship free within most of the european continent as long as you order for more
            |than 25£.////tend to do that for my books


    |It seems to only be released in the UK, the ISBN is 978-0141393049. ////It is a neat cover, but I think the publisher's nam
    | and logo are rather distracting.  


        |That's the cover design for a quite famous classics series by Penguin. Other books in the series cone :/ different colo
        |rs, with the text unredacted.


            |The more you read it, the more that black stuff comes off and reveals the actual title. Nice touch.


                |Damn, now I want it too


            |I find it amusing that your phone changed "come in" to "cone :/".


                |Swiping keyboards will be the downfall of humanity.////*Sent from a real-ass keyboard*


                    |It was ridiculously difficult to upvote this on my touch screen phone. 


        |&gt; but I think the publisher's name and logo are rather distracting.////*Good... Good...* that's what we *want* you t
        | look at... mwhahahaha


        |I doubt they intended it, but I think having the publisher's name more prominently displayed than the author's or title
        |is coincidentally fitting with the theme of the book.


    |Buy a Sharpie?


    |Well I believe it is a UK special edition. You can still get it on [Amazon.co.uk] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/0141393
    |41), but I don't know about availability outside of the UK.


        |Ohh I hope not, thank you for the help though!


            |amazon.co.uk will ship to the US.  Might cost a bit, but it is possible.


                |Can confirm with a quick test, to buy and ship to US (Seattle) would cost £12.73 around $20 for 6-10 days shipp
                |ng. ////You can also use your Amazon.com account on Amazon.co.uk


            |I might be able to get it for you if you can't find other options. I leave the US for London tomorrow and will be b
            |ck on Tuesday. I could always pop in a book store and just bring it back with me.


            |I'm in the UK and am happy to send it to the US for you. Let me know.


    |I have this edition (live in england) and i love this cover too.////There's allready something very cool about the Penguin 
    |lassics covers. The plain design and fonts are really attractive. They just seem to have a gravitas or credibility about th
    |m.  ////And thrn going and redacting the (embossed) title like that is just a stroke of genius, it sums up the book perfect
    |y,  and when i saw it on the bookshelf i bought it in a heartbeat.//

    |It's a 2013 release, so my guess is that it will not remain a UK exclusive for long. If you will die without it, pay the ex
    |ra to have it shipped over; otherwise, hang out for a year, it'll probably show up here in the states.////I'm guessing you 
    |now about abebooks.com, but if not add it to your list of search resources. Lots of used bookstores post their shelf stock 
    |here.


    |We get that cover here in NZ. This is the cheapest version I can find online http://www.mightyape.co.nz/product/Book/Ninete
    |n-Eighty-Four/20974748/////I too love this cover, outstanding design. 


    |Bought this copy from Dymocks in Australia a couple of weeks ago :)

    |i have seen this in bookstores in Australia, it's pretty unique


    |I have this version, you can get it from the Penguin books website however I bought it from Amazon. 


    |I bought this copy after seeing the cover to. I got mine on Amazon. I think nth is cover was only distributed in the UK tho

    |I just bought 1984 ( 60th anniversy edition) ////31 pages in as of today. Book is highly relevant and is frankly scaring me
    | I'm enjoying it thoroughly. Wish I had read it sooner in life, yet maybe I wouldn't appreciate as much. 


        |Great read. Read it in a world history class in 10th grade, can't believe it isn't a staple of highschool literature.


            |I was thinking the same thing in regards to the last part of your statement.  Course compulsory education being wha
            | it is,  maybe I can see why not. 


                |I know the only reason that I was introduced to it in highschool was because we had an awesome history teacher.
                |We read 4 books over the year, one a quarter, and three of them were just to get the class thinking about gover
                |ments and societites. the last was a first hand account of survivors of the uss indianapolis.


                    |Wow. I had 1984 and Animal Farm both assigned in school before the age of fourteen. Of course, after fourte
                    |n, they only saw fit to assign Brave New World FIVE TIMES. // //I started skipping class just because I'd a
                    |ready read the book that year in another class.

    |Search for "Charlie Bryne's Bookshop Galway" Send them an email. I know for sure they have it in stock (saw it last weekend
    |. You can arrange to have it posted to you if you're outside Ireland. 


    |Just get a sharpie and go to the library, leave the library, make your own

    |Oh god... I bought a copy of 1984 yesterday in our local English bookstore. They had two versions, one of them being OP's v
    |rsion. Needless to say I bought the other version.////Can someone explain what's so special about the copy in the OP? Did I
    |choose wrong?////EDIT: ah I get it, censorship 'n all... I'm an idiot, that took me way too long. Anyways, I don't really l
    |ke the cover that much. The black bars thingy is cool and all, but the publisher's name and logo are just too huge. I think
    |I'm glad I bought the other version.////EDIT2: [this](http://i.imgur.com/bppTDLq.jpg) is the version I bought. I like it.


        |I assume he just thought it was a cool design, but hey, its up to personal taste - you bought the copy you liked, OP li
        |es the other design, no problems.

    |Awesome covers, but what's more important are the words between them.


    |It's always been the cover.


        |No, it hasn't. I remember reading about it on BBC news or something, recently.
