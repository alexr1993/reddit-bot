Taught my 96 year old grandfather the word "selfie" today after he showed me a picture of himself from 1947. You're awesome, Grampy.(/r//r/Pics)




    |Your grandfather should really consider upgrading to a newer cell phone. 


        |Umm that's the vintage model iPhone


            |Damn hipsters.


                |The hipsters have been here all along. Lurking. Dwelling in rare, esoteric aging photos. Hinted at in stories o
                | old. ////They've been watching us from a shadowy distance, observing us. ////While we sleep, they been stealin

                    |How can we defeat them...?


                        |To beat them...we must **become** them. ////They'd fucking **hate it**. 


                            |That's the right idea


                            |You ever try and get the attention of someone, and they seemed to look straight through you - as if
                            |you didn't even exist? You start to reckon that the person judged you. They think they're better th
                            |n you, and it must have been your appearance that caused them to do this. That is what I do to hips
                            |ers, I look straight through them - because they don't exist.


                        |The only way to defeat a hipster, is to become a hipster. Then, and only then can the hipster no longer

                    |That.. was beautiful.


                    |/u/mossyskeleton, that sounds really similar to the shapeshifters on Fringe. Except that they can be killed
                    |with a bullet to the head ;-;

            |This kind of design of cameras is called ["Twin Lens Reflex" cameras or "TLR's"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_

            |re successively replaced by [SLR's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera) as they became cheaper 
            |nd more robust. SLR's were considered even more practical than the TLR's, with a more accurate viewfinder and often
            |using 35 mm film (as opposed to 60 mm in the case of most TLR's), making it able to take far more pictures with one
            |roll. Most TLR's take 12 square frames on one 120 roll. 35 mm rolls usually hold either 24 and 36 frames.////**Edit

    |Men don't take selfies, they take pictorial autobiographies.


    |He was a hipster back when it was cool to be one. 


        |They didn't exist back then

            |Hipster's a pretty old term


    |I thought at first he was looking down at me out of a window, taking pictures.


    |I wonder what app he used for the filter?


    |Your Grampy is a revolutionary.


        |He's a reel character, that's for sure.


            |I guess you could say////these pun threads really suck shit and are never funny


                |I'm not going toilet you talk about puns that way sir.

        |I was pretty sure I've seen this before also, no idea how to do a reverse image search via cellphone though. 


            |I'm pretty sure that there's a similar old photo of a man taking a picture of himself in a mirror that gets posted 
            |rom time to time. I'm pretty sure that the reposted one is slightly older and better quality. I tried reverse searc
            |ing but couldn't find anything.

                |I've definitely seen it on here before also.

        |you mean the OP is lying about his grandpa?


            |Verily


    |This is an awesome pic


    |The camera is a [twin lens reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-lens_reflex_camera) if anyone is interested.  


    |I call my Grandpa Grampy too! I thought I was the only one!


        |You are not alone!


            |I do too! Mine's 93 going on 94, and just one of the most hilarious people I know, so much fun to be around


    |The whole picture reminds me of the film Barton Fink for some reason


    |That's a real cool story in the title.


    |Your Grandfather is the original hipster!


    |thats fucking awesome


    |Your grandfather is Don Draper?


    |How far into the definition of selfie did you get before you realized how ridiculous you sounded?


    |pft and paul mcartney says he invented the selfie, id say this has him beat


    |Classic as Fuck 


    |what a handsome fella 


    |Where can I find this filter on instagram???


    |Its CLEARLY Benedict Cumberbatch.


    |Bonus points for no Duckface!


    |Am I the only person who think's they've seen the original before?


        |Yes. This guy is a phony! I've been trying to locate the original, but to no avail. I'm a 100% positive I've seen it be
        |ore.


            |Ok, then. I think it was even under the same title of, "guy takes first selfie" even.


    |What you mean this generation didn't invent the idea of taking a picture of themselves? 


        |That's preposterous!//


    |So if this was taken in 1947... That would make Paul McCartney around 5 years old... So either your grandfather has just pr
    |ven Paul McCartney wrong, or we should be seeing pictures of PC as a toddler holding a camera in front of the mirror.


        |Wrong about what? ////I'd not be surprised if this is the oldest selfie that we have register of


    |Michael Fassbender?


    |I hate the made up noun "selfie." I also hate the made up verb "twerk." If we can just phase these out.. that'd be great.


    |Sorry for the crappy cell phone quality. He has TONS of pictures that are only about 1.5" square. I also learned about quit
    | a few of his past romances before he married my grandmother. He was quite the ladies man if you couldn't tell from the pic
    |ure!


        |You're really committing to this I-swear-it's-not-a-repost thing, aren't you?


        |I didn't know they had Instagram back then!


        |I actually couldn't tell from the shitty picture.


    |I thought I was the only one who called their grandpa Grampy. 


    |This is the type of content that makes reddit awesome.


    |I had an uncle with one of those cameras, you had to look down into it to see what it was going to take..... His pics were 
    |lways blurry too.//


    |tell your grandfather he looks like a blurry instagram of Jon Hamm in MadMen


    |Took selfie before the term "selfie" is invented. This belongs in the hipster hall of fame.


    |Rollei! Greatest camera ever. 


    |I got a Polaroid 440 land camera, and my first photo with it was a selfie.


    |homeboy was 30 in 1947 - wow. 


    |The proto-hipster


    |Lookin goood, Pop-Pop!


    |Could we get this colorized please?


    |Your gramps favors Mitt Romney... No offense to your gramps tho.


    |1Up for Gramps. Grandparents are whats up.


    |Instagram aint got nothin on this


    |That's a nice twin lens reflex he's got there. Was he a photographer himself? 


    |Why did he choose that filter setting?! 


    |Amazing picture and great  time spent with him.  Sadly,  my aunts have stolen many,  many pictures from my grandpa albums..
    | 


    |I have the camera he is using. Awesome photo


    |Lost my grandpa this year.. Called him grampy too... Have an upvote


    |Don Draper right there.

    |ME LIKE GRAMPY!


    |The only other person I've ever heard call their Grandfather, Grampy.


    |Can I upvote this more than once?


    |Someone needs to Photoshop a blurry pop tart in there instead of a camera. I loved that trend.


    |Took selfies before it was cool


    |don draper


    |hipster grandpa is hipster                                


    |Pioneer


    |Guess we know who stole the mighty wings....


    |Now tell him he is the biggest hipster you know


    |The origional selfie.


    |Is the number at the top of the photo indicating an edition number (there were 47 other prints of this photo) or is it the 
    |hoto's order in an album/collection (the first of 47 photos)?


    |do you really call him grampy


    |It's about 15 years too soon, but your grandpa looks exactly like Donald Draper.


    |My grandpa had one of those. He gave it to me a while back. I still haven't used it. I should.


    |OH- Original Hipster


    |this is awesome man. //


    |He is the hipster of hipsters.


    |Dillinger? 


    |Hipster grandpa, taking grainy and blurry photos in the mirror before it was cool. 


    |I imagine your father plotting a cross-country trip with Carlo Marx while listening to some bop trumpeter blow his top.


    |#tbt #selfie #lookinghot #nofilter


    |Nice try, Dillinger.

    |sweet...wish my grandfather did that his stuff was lost in a fire at his moms


    |I am 24 and I have never taken a selfie in my life. Am I missing out?


    |Could you ask him what filter he used?


    |Is your grandfather a time-travelling Jon Stewart?


    |selfies are the most cringey thing on earth


    |Was your grandfather donald draper?


    |Oh what a hipster!


    |Don Draper?


    |http://imgur.com/fzhLllZ


    |that's cool, and also cool because i've never known anyone else who called their grandfather "grampy"


    |/u/_BenedictCumberbatch?


    |I love when I hear my grampa say:  "You think you invented this shit?"


    |World's first selfie and hipster! :o


    |Something something something, 'staged'. 


    |First selfie ever.

            |[If we're going to go that route...](http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm)


    |Did he paste it in Scapbook?


        |He has those black triangle things for each corner of every picture, and there are thousands. 


    |I like the filter he used


    |Aww thats so cool


    |When he showed it to his friends later that year they called him a faggot and told him it needed more JPG


    |You should invest in a scanner.


    |I sense a meme coming on.


    |I think if you put your cell phone another inch closer to the photo, you can finally completely obliterate any semblance of
    |a coherent image.


    |HA! Paul McCartney wasn't the first, I hope he sees this


    |So when a woman takes a selfie, she's a whore, but if your granddad does, he's awesome...


    |Was this picture taken with a potat.... Never mind. They didn't have HD back then. 


        |In a way they actually did, huge cameras with large plates that took really high quality pictures. This camera also has
        |a rather large surface, the reason it's fuzzy is probably due to the indoor exposure, and lack of tripod. 


            |You ruined my shitty joke man. Thanks. Getting all scientifical and stuff. Geez. 


    |i bet he has a duckface version too....


    |Selfie: a picture taken by someone too retarded to use a timer function and has no friends to hold a camera.


    |Too bad he took it with a potato


    |Looks like one of those shitty photoshop filters lololololololol
