    |It's a beautiful dream. Pandas that actually fuck, out of their own free will.


        |I found the problem. Pandas need to start drinking beer.////&gt;According to Zhang Zhihi, director of Chengdu Research 
        |ase of Giant Panda Breeding, "If they don't like the female's personality or the females don't like the male's personal

                |That's why they need beer.

                                |It means that beers in Finland aren't too good usually unless they are made in small breweries.

                        |So... "Bear".


                |what do you mean?


                    |It's a joke based on the social sexism stereotype that men will fuck all women, regardless of personality, 
                    |ven when sober, as opposed to women who'd only do that when they're drunk. 


                |That's a really creepy comment. Implying that sober woman = no sex ever.


                    |No, the implication is that sober women won't have sex with someone unless they like their personality.


                    |You misunderstand the joke. Stereotypically, sober women will have sex with a guy only if she likes the dud
                    |'s personality, while drunk women don't give a shit (just like stereotypical sober and drunk men).////There
                    |is absolutely no reason to think that I was saying that sober women never have sex.


            |Now I'm seriously wondering if they've tried using alcohol to help pandas copulate.


            |Yeah, pandas just kind of deserve to die. They may be cute, but they are an evolutionary dead end.//

            |Victims of child molestation in Western countries, including the US, almost always know their abusers well. Abusers

                |"Stranger Danger"////Most western children nowadays feel discomfort from an adult to touch them, not to mention

            |I might be reading this wrong but you kinda contradict yourself there. You say that people in Western nations moles
            | random kids, then go on to say it mainly happens with people they know (teachers, parents). I agree with you on th
            |t point, although not teachers or parents specifically. As far as I was aware the vast majority of sexual assaults 
            |re perpetrated by someone known to the victim. This goes across the board for most violent crimes. 


                |The numbers are actually 44% percent higher for sexual abuses. There are also twice as many people (relatively 
                |peaking) getting shot by an unknown perpetrator than being sexually abused (not assaulted).

        |    How did you get that //    close to someone else's kid //    with a camera?  


        |Any parent dumb enough to let their children wear something like that is likely not even paying attention to what you'r
        | doing. That or OP kidnapped the kid, put this shirt on him/her and then posted this for the karma. 


        |I came here to ask that same question lol


    |I think that was designed as an instructional guide. ////Kids go to zoos.////Pandas see the shirt and learn to fuck////Pand

        |We gotta help the ~~children~~ pandas!


            |Think of the pandas!


                |Now think of the pandas fucking!


        |It's the panda-sutra.

    |When my parents were on vacation in Cozumel, my mom bought my older brother a cute t-shirt which she thought had little car
    |oon lizards playing on it. ////My brother was sent home with a note from his third grade teacher, telling my mom that she c
    |nnot send my brother to school in inappropriate clothing. ////Turns out the lizards weren't playing, but were banging in va
    |ious Kama Sutra positions. Don't ask me why the shirt was made in a child's size, but you can bet your ass that from that p
    |int on, my mom made sure she was wearing her glasses when buying us clothes.////Edit: grammar


        |Little people?


        |when i was in high school a hot girl from one of the older grades gave me that shirt (from her spring break trip), and 
        | thought i was THE MAN. but of course i was like 14 and my mom still did my laundry, and she took the shirt and 'disapp
        |ared' it. i've been looking for it ever since. came to this thread for that reason!//


    |i enjoi this


        |It doesn't belong on r/wtf. Maybe r/wwf.


            |Thought you meant a combination of /r/aww and /r/wtf (wwf), and wanted to link to this subreddit: /r/awwwtf.////The

                |No, it's because the [pandas are wrestling!](http://alwaysgreenerscience.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/wwf_panda_
                |hair2.png) 


        |First thing I thought of too.


            |Yea nobody above got this...SK8orDIE


        |Did a project on their advertisements for art class in school, it was fun as fuck.


        |Dos pandaz dey woz seein' each othaz shit.


    |Sexual harassment......panda.


        |Who lives in the East 'neath the willow tree?


            |Pooh!


    |[I totally have underwear that are exactly like this.](http://imgur.com/JwVDrGw)////I got them in Japan and forget what bra
    |d they were. All i know is this is the "Large" and I am pretty sure it is a children's large.


        |has a girl ever refused to have sex with you because of these?


    |Fun fact: In China, [they show panda porn to pandas](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9932362/Panda-por
    |-shown-in-attempt-to-get-two-to-mate.html) to get them in the mood.


        |That might be indicative of a species that is supposed to go extinct.. 


            |But pandas are so cute!


    |Why does this even come in a kid's size?


        |That's what she said


    |I'm fairly sure this is something from the company 'Enjoi'...they always have pandas doing weird shit on their clothes.


        |And skateboards, socks, pretty much everything they make


    |Bearly legal.


        |White Panda


    |A clue to the question: where do babies come from? ////There you go kid. 


        |Reminds me of a recent zoo commercial (I think)://////Kid: "Daddy, where do baby pandas come from?"////Dad: "Well, uh, 
        |ou see... when a daddy panda loves a mommy panda..."////Kid: "Oh, well mommy tells me they come from China."


            |Mommy was smart. 


        |"You see, Wang Wang and Tang Tang love each other very much..."


            |"Wang Wang and Tang Tang"? Honestly? Getting into Rosie O'Donnell territory there...


    |Tell us a story about how you took this picture.


        |Yes I agree on the story because I also wonder. Especially seeing it before. :)


        |OP probably works at a daycare. 


    |Ahh yes.... the ancient Chinese art of Panda Sutra


        |I kept looking for someone to say this, and it's all the way at the bottom. We aren't funny.


    |I once saw a mother and her daughter (probably around 10 years old) come into my restaurant, and the kid was wearing a shir
    | with a hairless cat on it that just said "shaved" under it. I really hope that they never caught on to the joke.


    |Parent: hmm, lets see. Today my son will wear the pink shirt with the pandas having sex, Perfect! 


        |Its prolly easy to just glance it and see pandas. My mom bought me a Vans tee with a man smiling with a cat curled up o
        | his head and it said "always on mind". As we all know, cat related items are popular and she bought the tee thinking "
        |t was cute". Upon further inspection, she saw the caption and realized what she bought me. 


    |I worked at grocery store and I often saw this young boy under the age of 10 wearing [this](http://www.collwrites.com/wp-co
    |tent/uploads/2009/08/five_dollar_footlong.jpg) shirt while his parents shopped. Disturbed me to no end.


    |I'm sorry but this looks like a selfie.


    |I own a pair of underwear like this, got it from Urban Outfitters


    |There's a lot of pandamonium going on in that shirt. 


    |"HEY! you there! Kid! Yeah you. Can i take a picture of you? No no its okay.//Yeah just get in the van. I got an xbox for y
    |u in here!"


    |Wasn't this on the front page like two days ago saying something about China?


    |Panda-sutra


        |Karma sutra too, apparently.


    |Fucking pandas. . . 


    |What the hell were his parents thinking.


    |Those fucking pandas


    |Enjoi?


    |You and me baby aint nothing but mammals.


        |&gt; You and me baby aint nothing but mammals.////So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel.  


    |Awwww panda bears wrestling! Nothing cuter.


    |...why is it made in children's sizes??


    |This makes me a sad panda


    |Except this photo has been circulating on the internet for a few days, Can confirm OP is a liar.


    |It's an enjoi shirt. They're a skateboard company. 


    |That looks like something Tyler, the Creator would wear.


    |I had a shirt with skeletons fucking in different positions. It also had "Boners" spelled in bones every now and then.


    |Show the pandas some love....


    |Ooo cute pandas...-coughs then chuckles-


    |I want it


    |One of her parents is a troll 


    |Are you for panda rape?

    |What kind of parent would buy a shirt like that for a little kid?  Or maybe I'm just waaaaaay behind the times. ///////////

    |My mother bought me a Wolfenstein 3D T-shirt back in the early 90's when I was in elementary school because I loved the gam
    | so much.  It was a very questionable shirt for, really, anyone to wear.  However, she explained to me very clearly *not* t
    | wear it to school.  So what do I do?  Wear it to school.  That day my mother got a phone call questioning her very sternly
    |by the principal why her son was wearing a shirt that said "Whatever the question, lead is the answer."//She was not happy 
    |ith me.

    |Pounda bears


    |That's a lot of "Panda"monium on one shirt.


    |&gt; So


    |I wore something pretty similar back in kindergarten for a few weeks IIRC. Moms bought it for me in Hawaii, only difference
    |was it was two little cartoon lizards bangin it out. Weird how that stuff slips by parents.


        |My mother-in-law gave our son a towlie shirt. He has down syndrome and his high school asked that he doesn't come to sc
        |ool wearing it again.

    |I think it's cute.


    |Where do I get one for my kids???


    |I think I'm gonna try the top right position tonight.


    |That they make this shirt in kids sizes is pretty WTF worthy if you ask me.//


    |Panda-monium 


    |Looks like something Enjoi would make 


    |I think its really adorable. Also pandas fucking is a good thing. More panda babies. 


    |where2cop?


    |Some people will say, "Who would let their kid wear that?"  ////I would say, "Who the fuck makes that in a childs size?"///
    |I'd see it at a thrift shop and say, "I'm totally fucking buying that for my kid!"//


    |It's pandas!
