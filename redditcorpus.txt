make him chase you up the driveway just scratch his precious yickl head me and that donkey would be best friend damn you for make me want donkey love dat ass what a stubborn ass scratch my ass is that whi your mirror is broken dude even us human love head rub it so stress reliev ive never heard of a mini donkey befor i live close to a farm that rais llama as well as four mini donkey  the four are alway group up in pair  one day i saw one of them with his head up on his partner back take a nap in the sun so the longer i rub it the higher itll go i general panic and when i do reviv some one come along kill me and the guy i just reviv i feel bad then you can also charg your defib switch to a weapon without let go the charg button and continu kill n stuff when you need to reviv someon just switch to defib and they will automaticali be use thus reviv the person un front of you inmediat with full heath or throw one of your infinit suppli med kit after reviv someon if time doe not permit you to full restor your teammat im a paramed in real life and this total work  realli your better off reviv them and throw them a medkit while your rub your defib togeth you will either get shot and die or the guy your tri to reviv will respawn the game is way too fastpac for defib rub to be use un nonnich situat here anoth tip for medic  if you kneel over a player and rub the paddl togeth for a few second your risk of be shot yourself go up by about 4000 aint nobodi got time for that  paramed here can confirm that a resuscit person subsequ recoveri is proport to how much electr they were given took me awhil to figur this out too also use in kill enemi player if your into that kinda thing you need a pictur to say this the longer you charg the higher the chanc get the corps despawn  peopl keep say this but it more difficult than you think  if i actual beat the short timer to reviv you chanc are the enemi isnt far away  whi should i put myself at risk by charg when i can just reviv you and throw a medpack on you and continu on my way not get shot up with my dick in hand this is so flaw in so mani way first you dont know exact how long the person has been lie there so there a high chanc if you rub them togeth for more than an instant theyll die and respawn next there the fact that your complet vulner sit there rub them togeth third there the fact that half the time you hit somebodi with defib it doesnt regist then there the method in which you just hit them with the defib and drop a medic bag on their head   they should serious go back to the old method the new one just isnt function the 100 point per reviv gave peopl an incent to reviv teammat now it usual stick your neck out that result in an enemi just get a doubl kill  fun fact rub defibril paddl togeth in real life is complet pointless and can sometim damag the equip you either rub them long enough to reviv to 100 health or rub long enough to see them disappear you should point out how to do this  the how is where everyon is fail  you need to hold down your defib button  to actual defib someon you releas the button  onc you know this get defib kill is realli realli easi thing is sometim i can onli tri quick reviv you caus there are enemi to be dealt with or you are lie in an _extremely_ bad posit and so you at least have some sort of chanc peopl see to underestim a basic shot at an potenti free life  well appar im retard  thank and it would take exact fraction of that rub time for some arbitrari wooki to make hole in me  aint nobodi got time for that wait you can charg your defib ive alway just quick tap the button to reviv someon i had no idea thank you so muchtil i alway threw the medic bag down right after but peopl wouldnt wait for a complet heal wow just like real life as an emt i wish this was actual true  here a better tip for you medic out there defibril are now useless  you can onli reviv someon one time and after that theyr pointless to have id much rather have a grenad launcher so i can actual contend with vehicl  imo worst chang of bf4 realli take away from squad dynam  dont think i dont know whi they did it bf3 reviv spam was out of control but by forc you to rub them togeth befor reviv that was alreadi enough of a nerf they didnt need to make it one reviveperson and reduc the score to 20 pointsrev to kill two bird with one stone i reviv them and immedi throw down a medic kit get me reviv point and medic kit ribbon while still play as a team player edit i do this when i know the area is clear of enemi the game is so hectic nowaday that if you start rub those thing togeth youll get shot usual the victim is out in the open and there a veri veri good chanc theyll despawn befor you get them up you liter have to see them go down in front of you to have time to rub it in as it were  the better way still is to reviv instant and throw a medkit so they can regen while lay down if somebodi is camp and shoot them youd be dead also anyway   this would be veri use if there was a timer abov somebodi when they die that say how mani more second until they respawn the countless amount of time ive ran across open fire to reviv a teammat when the defib symbol disappear into bf4 land just like real life here a better tip for medic actual be a medic there way too mani peopl run around tri to get 1337 ki11 with grenad launcher instead of help the team out with constant defibmedkit use especi in game like tdm sdm and domin where you need the most peopl aliv anyway not to mention there no real point in blow stuff up on those type of map becaus theyr usual so small that flankingevad is imposs unless your tri to clear a path quick or suppress an enemi to help captur an object you should be reviv and heal my thought as a nursehttpwwwmemecreatororgstaticimagesmemes2266767jpg this is pointless 90 of the time becaus by the time i hold the defib long enough the person im tri to reviv respawn just drop a health pack and quick reviv also if your play support share your ammo for god sake i did not know this veri cool thank doe this work in battlefield 3 good tip op  peopl despawn after abit rub the defib just wast second of their life i alway keep my gun out till im at the person i want to reviv so i usual dont have time for the whole charg thing but i will throw down a medic after so now instead of run out into the middl of a battlefield to quick reviv i can hold it while run there so they wont die 2 second after i reviv them itll be 4 second yay i dont do a reviv unless i can rub them for awhil i at least reviv in the 70s and up  yeah im have troubl even get a normal reviv done insid the reviv window never mind do this too but that would reduc the chanc of you die again instant so i can start the whole process over for mad pointz yea but then your not get defibril and medic pack bonus if you throw a medic bag down  or throw down a dam medpack on lancang pleas huh on 3 they alway did i quit like the sound of this featur less spam reviv medic it total useless to charg it up itss way better and net you more point if you just reviv them and throw a medic pack at them or throw the medic pack first then reviv which i recommend the problem with the charg up is that it take way to freak long time im not sure if you must time it correct to get 100 health which would be idiot sinc no one wanna learn that shit or you need to actual hold the charg for like 4 second or so caus i tri both never got more than 60 health reviv i onc held the charg for like 10 second still not full yeah but due to the short time you have to reviv someon a lot of the time you cant get the reviv off with fulli charg defib good tip but there are almost no medic who use the defib anyway at least that how i feel most peopl seem to prefer dem nade and tube and stuff yeah but the reviv window is like 5 secondsbi the time you rub one out heh they alreadi respawn peopl have been tri to get this into assault skull sinc day one good luck i thought everyon did this i thought you had to rub them togeth it would be nice if they made it so the more health you give someon when you reviv them the more point you reciv most match im in medic are just look for easi point when they reviev you stuck in the middl of some heavi crossfir with no cover fuck it reviev him for some point who care if he die right away  if there was some sort of reward for the medic im sure we would see some more of this but for the most part they dont give a shit how long you live afterward  i alway tri to get a higher hp count for my reviv but the time threshold is way too short everytim i go to reviv someon fulli or more than half i am too late   so what i do is i reviv them quick and throw a medic pack immedi after work veri well and i get the reviv i alway rub them first if i have time but also sometim if we just clear the area of enemi ill drop a medkit and reviv them with littl hp butbutbutth point for the heal but that will lose me all of the addit squad heal point ill get for the medic bag i threw at them befor reviv them poor man that would be great if i could actual play but if you throw a medkit and then quick reviv him not onli do you get more point but you also get him to full health faster i rather guarante the reviv and throw a med pack than risk wait longer i rare ever know when the person actual went down dont you get more point for a quick reviv and then heal with med pack deff mote with squad member but random peopl im not sure wow i had no idea it work like that if you do it in real life you look realli cool too i reviv and throw a medkit so i can get medkit ribbon to unlock the ace 23 doesnt health regen anyway doe it work with the grenad launcher  this is if ani medic are present or if im even present in a game for that matter  this is if ani medic are present or if im even present in a game for that matter  never knew this about the defib thank for the help tip also a full charg will kill an oppon do i get more point too this would be relev if peopl actual use the defibril is that how they balanc defib   back in bc2 you could do a runbi defib and the friend would be back up instant with full health  comp ladder even had to make a rule limit the number of medic per team becaus a team of noth but medic was almost unstopp  but brother you will come back as a robot this isnt human hope someon can call bull shit on this if it isnt true but i was play with a guy on the xbox one who would follow me around everywher to reviv me it was obvious  a pretti amaz cushion to have at time but he told me on the mic that the reason i was come back with full health so quick was becaus he was tbag a certain way next to my bodi   like i said i have no clue if he was make shit up becaus his explan was too hard for me to give it a shot myself dure game play but he would alway tbag next to my bodi and i would come back with 80100 health everi time rather quick too  i bare get to give a full heal in time peopl respawn so fast it pointless know is half the battl til rub the paddl togeth actual doe someth amaz  the defibril they use in battlefieldamong other game are outdat today defibril are automat and simpli attach to your upper right peck and on your lower left rib well that a game changer i have alway wonder whi sometim i reviv with like 22 health but from time to time i would be reviv at full regardless apolog to the countless poor bastard i have reviv and drop a med pack who had to sit around to heal  as a medic i onli use defib on my enemi by do this you can also kill peopl with them this has taught me so much  whi the shit doe this get up vote do you guy serious not know this after play the game for this long my reviv are base on the situat if you just die and the area is clear then ill full reviv throw a health pack and wait a few second if i dont know how long youv been dead then ill do a quick reviv throw a health pack and cover you if im in cover your in the open right next to cover and it a fire fight then ill full reviv and throw a pack but you better get move if you want to live  what im tri to get at is after you reviv peopl throw them a pack also tri to full reviv as much as possibl and then while your charg the defib the guy bleed out and respawn top tip 2 dont run toward the down guy whilst charg the pad as you move at a snale pace and the guy usual expir by the time you get there take too long get shot at have a health pak is it possibl to kill an enemi with the defibril this featur sound like it base 100 on realiti is this a serious post or mock medic who reviv 20 and dont throw down a medkit  can you sprint while charg becaus most of the time im halo jump around for those nervous reviv or ill alreadi be on the run from shot alreadi n i zap them as im run like a bitch  no time for that i find it quicker to zap em throw a pack and get outta dodg  if it a big push in a narrow hallway and your around the corner i usual charg em up  that medkit will alway be by my side  lol i post this here and got downvot to hell for not know this alreadi i throw down a med pack right next to themthey will get at least 60 if they just get up and runmost of the time the person that kill them is still look in that general areagotta rev and dip  and anoth tip look around and kill the enemi that kill the player befor reviv  otherwis you will rez someon and both of you will get shot  oh and on oper locker when it is a stalem outsid of c dont rez peopl that are in clear view of the tunnelgrenad chuck work for irl medic too  sourc i use to have a serious il until i was overcharg with defibril no then they wont get immedi pop allow me to reviv them again for more point wash rins and repeat i dont even have bf4 and i knew this ive never play it either  damn you colleg but but it so much more fun use it to kill enemi with charg it and kill an enemi sniper  yea or you can do a quick reviv and throw a medkit down  no need to wast that extra 34 second here is a tip dont get kill been playin sinc beta and did not know this my roommat will also be mind blown you rock op also pleas check to clear the fuck room befor you res me or well just both die again also if you plan on be a dedic medic be sure to pick the combat medic spec if you have it unlock instead of take 3 second for full charg it take 15 i saw the imag on front page and im on mobil i was wtf then i saw the text and felt stupid  also the rang on the defib seem to be pretti far at least it was when i was watch a stream the other night anoth trick as a medic support etc when you see a teammat ask for a med pack or ammo give him some dont run by do your own lone ranger shit sure ill rub the defibril long enough as long as you damn peopl stop instant respawn so i dont stand there look like a jackass and get kill in the process as a major combat medic in bf4 i will still never do this my life is more import then your so i will reviv you and drop a med pack like i have been do as i can not get snipe wait that to much work and there is the chanc the reviv will time out oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh thank captain obvious aint nobodi got time for that quick zap  drop a medkit and gtfo anyth longer than this and i typic get shot dead just like in real life mind blown i want my damn medic ribbon though i appli this onli when they die close enough to me other than that i reviv and toss a medkit to make sure i can actual get the reviv just like real life anoth tip you can reviv from multipl bodi length away if your reviv from max rang and charg it up it way more use than stand right over them and give them no health to work with  when im not get shot at from all side ill rub em for as long as you need but i wont risk myself longer than i need to if it mean i too will be shot down i thought the maximum you can get from a defib is 80 i would realli just appreci a reviv to start with actual if you slap them with the defib without a warmup and then throw a medic box on them you make more point overal everi time and reduc your odd of be taken down in the process  this also allow you to recov more than one alli in less than a few second  do so increas the odd of them surviv the recoveri on the floor and get back up to help  sourc  tier 1 assault class tier 1 skill tier 1 tank tier 1 chopper tier 1 assault rifl tier 1 grenad top 1000 in the world with engineeringmed you get more point as well im rank 65 and i didnt even know that medic are good guy greg who will play a video game to reviv peopl all game dont forget you can also reviv at a pretti generous distanc no need to be give the kiss of life anoth tip dont reviv me if im just go to get shot and die again right afterwardsjustjust let me die   dont matter youll be one shot a second later so who didnt know this thought it was common knowledg sometim you dont have time wow i didnt even know you could hold it   did peopl actual not know this yea but tri do that while dodg bullet and grenad just to get to the person that fellit kinda use to be abl to shoot back dure all that id rather throw a medpack while on the way to the bodi and then quickrev thank not sure which bug me more that this tip is post for the millionth time or that peopl still dont know this  franki taught me this a while back not sure but i thought the player caus the shorter time i tri not to rub them at all becaus player respawn too fast in bf4 at least i had time to run to them and get a reviv off in bf3 also defib has a lot of rang like 2 or 3 meter on normal mode in real life rub them togeth for that long bring a patient to 0 hp all medic  drop a med box and give a quick zap and be on your way and get all dem glourious heal pointi point yay teamwork dank m3mes m16 as someon who love reviv teammat im embarrass for have not known this but you dont love be reviv at 20 life and get hit with a stray bullet right away whi did i come to the comment i havent play this game yet    i person just go for the 20 hp and drop a health box crate sinc it mean that im out of the danger zone and they still get the health   onli downsid is that some peopl dont go for the health point and instead choos to leav the healthpack just be happi i reviv you  yeah right that take way too long in the heat of the moment the game could crash two mayb three time by the time your done i wish medic would actual frick reviv me i sacrif  my life to suppress an entir squad for you and you just walk away it also make the zap longer rang and it doe more damag to enemi but do i get point for that caus reviv and then drop a medpack is some sweet sweet doubledippin fuck dat i want the medkit ribbon rub them bitch togeth for like 9 second and then throw down that health pack extra point beotch how the heck did i not know that buuuuttt if you want more point you could reviv them get reviv point then throw down a med pack and get extra point and they will still regener too 100 health fair quick op must never play in rank lobbi either  more then not by the time i do that the option to reviv them is gone when i play as medic i just do a quick reviev then throw a medic bag on them as a medic player i thought this was common knowledg upvot though not charg the pad is a good way to grief appar how in the hell do peopl not know this by now they onli talk about it in a ton of their video and almost everi beta you tube video would show it if you dont know this then you probabl have no idea how to do a lot of thing in bf4 i tri to do this onc but i took so long the player die so i made a singl promis never again ill do this onc the server allow me to actual play again ive run into a glitch where the person doesnt reviv even if they just die or even if i hold the defib for a while anyon know what goin on i usual just reviv peopl in the midst of combat and throw a health pack on their bodi if the area theyr in is safe that give them a full heal if they stay put and time for me to protect us from oncom enemi rub them to 100then without unclick switch to your weapon when the time come flip out the defib in reviv rang of your patient insta 100 reviv here yet anoth tip you dont need to be straddl the corps as you charg you can charg in cover and run to the bodi zap him and run away   dont be clueless codi over here and stand over a bodi get shot pop out when you have a full charg mind blown i will rub all day now you can kill with those bastard routsid or i could reviv quick at a lower health and toss you a med pack so i dont get my ass shot off there need to be an indic for fulli charg paddl though as it stand now i have no idea if ive charg way past 100 or onli to 83 even just a simpl sound file as an indic everytim i tri that it doesnt let me reviv the person at all i total forgot this game even exist after give up on it crashi bullshit natur after about a week same thing for kill enemi too aint nobodi got time for that mayb you should post your first person shooter shit in the bf4 subreddit and as soon as your readi to shock they resplend somewher els i like to just tap them aliv then toss a med kit that tks them so they can use punish  yea this would work but the reviv timer is onli 6 second or so so it kinda fuck pointless  i dont rub then for long caus peopl can die for food while your charg them it just like real life uber charg do that take waaay too long i would rather reviv you throw down a med bag and we can both continu shoot peopl  better tip at least fuck reviv just be happi you got reviv it almost as effect as throw down a medkit then reviv them  half the time in the middl of a gunbattl it just quicker to reviv them quick and throw a medic pack at them if you stand there rub them togeth youll most like get shot shit thank op you can charg your defib how ps4 it realli not that practic honest you cant run while hold the charg plus you get more point for the higher reviv i want to add to this   the distanc at which you can reviv someon is much greater than you think it is i should do a video about this one  well sometim you dont have time to do that just hold squar and itll do a quick charg without have to get the paddl out  judg by the number of peopl who were unawar of this fact i can conclud that the cancer of battlefield resid on reddit still not worth it if you stand there and charg your paddl for 4 second your dead if you instant reviv someon at 20 health theyr dead therefor no one bother reviv anymor i honest just prefer the old system at least then you get reviv they should just revert to the old system from bf3 it work rambo reviv or not  also if you stand there charg the other person will just spawn back in a split second befor you tri to reviv them there should at least be a timer that hover abov the littl skullrev icon that tell you when theyll have the chanc to hit the deploy button i honest hate reviv anyon in this game i prefer you say thank you and accept your reviv no matter the amount of health you have dont look this gift hors in the mouth  oh wow is it 6 month ago here a better tip reviv and back the fuck up out of enemi fire and throw a health pack the longer i hold the paddl the longer im an easi target instruct unclear rub defibril togeth too long patient die  sourc irl medic  real life result may vari drop a health pack befor reviv is also accept  charg paddl take too long in a firefight   becaus scienc thank for make this a meme and gather karma those self post are such a nuisanc yeah except half the time the bodi disappear while im charg it up so no you get a 20 reviv and a med kit armi medic here  chest paddl seem like someth that would be nice to have i thought this was common knowledg i learn this within five minut of play mani of us know this we just cannot feasibl perform this when there are sever dead team mate around us  charg paddl take too long you risk the bodi disappear or wors get shot just quick paddl the guy and drop a medic bag on top of him cant wait to buy bf4 and ps4 ahhh it look so cool  is this the same as in bf3 anoth one if you think your about to be kill a if you are a medic dont reiv anoth player they wont make it either  b if you are not a medic call out that you need a medic either a medic will run to help and get to you in time or they will alreadi be on the way to aveng you and then pick you up as long as the medic dosent fault the first option so much karma for someth that i thought everyon learn month agowtf guess not i dont play medic too much what button do you hit to rub them togeth  i have alway just reviv them and throw the larg medkit in their face  xbox 360 that is of cours if the medic actual carri defib sigh you just blew my freak mind so mani time have i been reviv onli to be shot dead less than a second later mind  blown dont think this need to be said either way im usual not will to wait on the reviv sinc the window is so small in bf4 so i pop them a quick reviv if they are behind cover and drop them a health box and they can wait and heal rather than me possibl miss the res now if they arent behind cover i tri to hit them with a larger reviv still probabl not 100 and a health box as well this is a good way to die yourself just quick reviv and med drop for me i general panic and when i do reviv some one come along kill me and the guy i just reviv i feel bad then i alway thought this was a useless featur in battlefield 4 while it may clock in some realism point the fact of the matter is that 90 of the time by the time you get to the down teammat sprint so you cannot charg the defib you dont have more then a second or two befor their timer run out  charg the defib mean the person die i did not know this and i feel a bit silli now here an obvious fuck fact for you retard dear player tell me how to play this game   who who whoa this is complet against how i want to play the game nub  im the high tier of medic who use it onli for the assault rifl and the med kit is onli for myself and wtf a defib it doesnt self reviv me  sincer asshol  alright honest i can understand not be reviv sometim i die in a bad spot but no combat around see the flash plus symbol and you dont drop a medkit  i rememb battlefield 2 no point or anyth and peopl would reviv yougiv ammoect bad compani 2 peopl still did it but that was becaus it was better then kill peopl battlefield 3 they reduc the point less peopl did it battlefield 4 they reduc the point further for this stuff no one ever doe it but fellow clan mate ive play a few hundr hour into that game and onli had 3 medic drop me a health kit at most  honest gun at this point should just be univers no one want to play their class they just want the gun and play some cod lol who actual play as medic pretti bad blanket statement for medic at the end of the day no matter what system your on medic and support will do fuck all to help you  as for engin to be honest theyr rare ever need my lab will general bring me one toy after the other  it so cute

too  so if this coach is success and the team win mani game next season then can we expect a movi within the next 10 year uhh yea fuck those rule and fuck go to texa im go to usc or ohio state  said everi top 100 recruit ever remind me of samuel jackson coach carter as a uofl student this make me sad thank to strong our program got back on it feet hope he goe a long way in his career  tennesse fan here i think you all got a good one in charli strong peopl were tell texa to be care what you wish for when send off mack brown look at tennesse program  we havent recov from the forc resign of phil fulmer but i think strong will definit lead your school in the right direct and get result quick hell we tri to lure him away from louisvill to no avail  rule 7 aint nobodi got time for that transcript    strong expect  1 player will attend all of their class and sit in the front two row of all of their class gas academ folk posit coach will be check constant now  2 no headphon in class no text in class sit up and take note  3 if a player miss a class he run until it hurt if he miss two class his entir posit unit run if he miss three the posit coach run the posit coach dont want to run  4 no earring in the footbal build no drug no steal no gun treat women with respect  5 player may not live off campus anymor unless theyr a senior who hit certain academ standard the univers will buy out leas for everi player current live off campus and put them in the athlet dorm  6 the team will all live togeth eat togeth suffer togeth and hang out togeth they will becom a true team and learn to impos account on each other the cliqu are over  7 there no time for a rebuild i dont have time for that the expect is that texa win now  8 player will learn that they would rather practic than milk a minor injuri  9 the focus is on win and graduat anyth extran to that is a distract and will be stamp out of remov  10 strong met individu with senior and key leader and reemphas that the plan is to win now they can lead the new cultur or be run over by it  11 i dont want to talk about thing id rather do thing we just talk now it time to do i would scam the shit out of 5   1 sign a leas to a friend homeapart for a ridicul cost   2 univers pay that ridicul leas   3 split the profit i wonder if this new approach is indic of a lax environ dure mack brown era or this is just the mental reemphas specif  1 go to class  2 go to class do shit in class 3 go to class 4 no earring also be a decent human be  glad to see someon has their prioriti straight   i am so glad i stop play sport after high school start relax met girl parti with more relax peopl decid educ was import and footbal was not a smart career choic got a degre got a great job do what i love with the love of my life and honest consid myself one of the happiest peopl on earth  unfortun i watch 3 of my good friend spend the prime of their life work toward play in the nfl and miss out on so much they spent their time in colleg in program veri similar to this two of them made it one went to practic squad for a season with the chief and the other play 3rd string for the titan for two season both now have serious injuri that will be with them for life a communic degre work remedi job are both divorc with child support payment and live paycheck to paycheck just tri to get by  the absolut worst part that crush me the most is that these guy constant live in those day of high school and colleg as if they are still occur we are in our 30s and i still hear them talk about how mani tackl they had or how they lit up that one guy return a punt back on varsiti they have in effect becom real life al bundi and realli onli have fond memori of their glori day and those just get further away and more fade with age   i love sport i will encourag my kid to play them and even support them go to a school with a program like this if they chose too i just hope anyon that is involv in a program like this one know the sacrific they will be make will be life alter even after colleg this could either fail miser or succeed like the titan  kid who know they arent go to the nfl arent go to give up their whole colleg experi just to win a coupl game gt the team will all live togeth eat togeth suffer togeth and hang out togeth they will becom a true team and learn to impos account on each other the cliqu are over  so by form a cliqu the cliqu are over hook em motherfuck i realli realli want strong to be the head coach at florida  most of us u of l fan love charli strong for exact thing like this his no bullshit attitud is someth that player learn to respect his outlook on sport not onli build a better team but build better human be his contribut to the communiti here in louisvill was immeasur and what make it even more impress is he not onli chose not to public broadcast his good deed he would often refus media coverag on them he creat chariti and organ that gave equip to poor youth program and under privileg children across the citi focus on keep them safe while learn footbal and keep them focus on the game and off the street   this guy is the kind of coach we need in colleg footbal for him to be follow here at u of l by petrino almost make me sick  i am cri tear of happi at the moment what is this ncaa 2014 it okay you can use his name it is charli strong  1 sound like it straight from coach carter i even read it in samuel l jackson voic the cliqu are over make a new cliqu  i like how treat women with respect is an afterthought on 4 doesnt seem to logic follow no earring in the footbal build but i guess you have to throw it in there somewher  someon read sun tzus the art of war  bad ass  bring back ol school smash mouth team footbal   either you buy in or your gone sound like a fun guy i saw this in rememb the longhorn what no earring what next are you go to take away my drug and gunsoh damn whi is it alway treat women with respect and not treat peopl with respect relev and hilarioushttpstwittercomchuckfnstrong   meet my player renam them with man name  joe bergeron 24 is now franklincarbonit smashbillion i am gunneri sergeant hartman your senior drill instructor http4bpblogspotcom5jdelt9r66ct7vbyt9t5aiaaaaaaaasa8yvpy7nvincs1600rememberthetitansjpg  immedi what i thought of when i saw this list yeah this is never go to happen forc player to sit in class  rofl  good luck charli  texa fan here hell yeah buy out current player leas  jesus christ if ever there was an argument that tuition was too fuck expens  former d1 player here dure my 5 year redshirt in cfb that asid from have everi player live on campus everi new coach institut rule exact like this when they begin their tenur  they alway want to chang the cultur of a program and general noth ever chang other than small polici earring meet polici yada yada  at ani level it all come down to win after the dust settl and thing are in full swing i doubt strong will give two shit if said star defens end sit in the front row of class so long as he isnt do dumb shit that cannot be kept under wrap  such as rape women at fsu as a louisvill fan i miss strong alreadi now were stuck with petrino again  the no gun part from a black coach in texa will be a career ender that was way more awesom than i thought it was go to be the part of my brain that is respons for lazi stereotyp was expect to see no drink no fornicatin mo prayin  glad to be wrong  gt no gun    umm did he forget what state the school is in hhhnnnnnnnnggggg this is the sort of thing everi team need to implement it will help all of them for their futur after colleg and make them all better peopl pretti sure the part about buy out player current leas is a littl against ncaa rule not that a big school has an issu with break ncaa rule just sayin just like in the movi i think colleg footbal need more of this kind of thing assum of cours that he is abl to hold everyon account for these expect it also make sens that colleg footbal could use a posit stori in regard to coachplayerprogram interact  my main concern is we still dont have a fuck quarterback sound like a full time job what the pay my onli issu is that 4 should have end with treat peopl with respect i like him alreadi  that some great recruit materi there i would love to see someon knowledg weigh in on the permiss of buy out student athlet hous leas   i havent seen an arrang like this befor perhap the rule deal with room and board allow the univers to do thing like this but it easi to think of way to abus it  i think he watch rememb the titan right befor he wrote this charli strong is a good coach and a great man good for texa they made the right hire i play colleg volleybal and we have veri similar rule we have to attend all class and sit within the first two row we are not allow to wear tank top rudecrud cloth and no hat insid build we have to eat togeth and if we arent with ani men player our coach want us to find a women

wolf of wall street got a lot of love cant believ spike jonz didnt get a direct nomin and that joaquin phoenix wasnt nomin for best actor  love that the dvds of jackass bad grampa will have an oscarnomin on the cover   edit wow thank for the gold realli hope her get the win for product design the futur look so damn good in that film insid llewan davi got fuck it such a good movi too wow

nomine  ha  who would have thought the danish media is go apeshit over the nomin of the hunt finger cross david o russel is the first director ever to direct two cast into all four act categori and he did it in back to back year bradley cooper over daniel bruhl is crimin my surpris  tom hank not nomin  alexand payn for best director  paul greengra did not get nomin  onli best sound mix and cinematographi for insid llwelyn davi  emma thompson not nomin  han zimmer not nomin for his score12 year a slave   surpris joaquin phoenix didnt get a nomin for best actor wouldnt have won in such an immens talent categori but still he deserv at least a nomin sorri adam sandler mayb next year hope for a  leo win but realist i dont see it happen go belgium hope the broken circl breakdown get there happi to see dalla buyer club with so mani nomin remark movi with outstand perform from mcconaughey and leto if you want to tri and watch some of the foreign languag film i can recommend the danish film the hunt it featur hannib actor mad mikkelsen alongsid some of denmark best actor and the director is the amaz thoma vinterberg this just in the academi think the crood is better than monster univers graviti is a sure win for best visual effect it has to be  i serious cant believ insid llewyn davi didnt get a singl nomin  edit a singl nomin in the big categori or origin song my biggest disappoint no daniel bruhl for best support actor i know it was an outsid chanc but he was awesom   veri surpris at no hank for captain phillip but im not argu it either most overr movi of the year although i like the underdog abdi get a nom   also disappoint in no llewyn davi and surpris gandolfini didnt get the nomin given his pass  is this alfonso cuarón year i dont think hes like to have a better chanc good to see jackass get the nod for makeup thought the acadami would pass over it for be you know jackass doe anyon els think it is absolut injustic that fruitval station has 0 nomin how about barkhad abdi the limo driver get a nomine im not sure exact how pacif rim didnt get nomin for visual effect or sound mix im stoke for the nomin of broken circl breakdown for foreign languag film it easili the best film in general ive seen in the last five year torn between who i want to win best soundtrack on one hand graviti soundtrack made the film so much better at part especi with the destruct of the iss with noth but the soundtrack  yet her soundtrack was beauti and heartbreak the piano piec were perfect for the film notabl snub tom hank for both his perform robert redford paul greengrass insid llewelyn davi daniel bruhl was snub it a shame becaus he was the onli actor who i was actual cheer for to win one perri bibl fellowship classic httppbfcomicscomarchive_bpbf078nautical_awardsjpg one nomin for save mr bank is a complet joke the same for there not be a singl nod toward emma thompson she was complet breathtak in that movi  in other news frozen has damn near secur their award and im pray that the hunt win too  9 best pictur nomine a third year in a row it time to just make it a solid 10 again jare fuck leto is an academi award nomin actor now how fuck sweet is that  i hope jennif lawrenc doesnt get best support her perform was good but noth great   imo she didnt deserv the globe no jame franco for support actor in spring breaker  i know it was a long shot but i wish adèl exarchopoulo got nomin for best actress probabl the most affect femal perform of the year or at least second to cate blanchett no best pictur or best actor for llewyn davi  pfff 12 year is not onli the best movi of the year but also the movi that should win by oscar standard it rare when that happen for those who havent seen it or those who are think it just anoth movi about race made to win oscar fuck crash should make time for it  steve mcqueen is an incred director fassbend was amaz terrifi and his portray of a slave owner was unlik most seen today  and you cannot talk about the movi without speak of ejiofor   in the year where black cinema broke from the standard hollywood convent of black lead with a stronger kind help white support actor 12 year the butler fruitval station mandela etc it is fit that this movi win best pictur  and not onli through the polit of the oscar  but through the emot journey the movi take us on  12 year was the most memor movi of this year and should get recognit no blackfish in best documentari that surpris the crap out of me these nomin are kind of realli bore american hustl was not that remark to get all four act nomin im sick of peopl ride david o russel dick tbh sorri that was uncal for   im happi that leo and jonah hill were nomin yet sad that adel exarchopol and margot robbi were overlook even if it was a long shot and no joaquin phoenix love anyon els glad they snub han zimmer for 12 year way too much recycl go on in that score i scroll and scroll and have yet to see anyon comment on nebraska  out of all the movi nomin i still have to see wow  will see but nebraska is the one i enjoy the most  i thought bruce dern and june squibb were phenomen   pacif rim no nomin for visual effect that a bit odd american hustl is so overr jeez im a littl surpris that prison didnt get more love deni villeneuv deserv a look for direct i think american hustl has crack that perfect best pictur formula of decent perform and product valu without ani immedi controversi and no ramif after it is complet forgotten in a few year see argo michael fassbend gave the perform of the year for me in 12 year a slave i hope he win but i think leto will take support actor so julia robert get a nom for play herself   jennif lawrenc again nomin for act like jennif lawrenc cant believ hugh jackman and jake gyllenha werent nomin for their perform in prison those were serious some of the best perform ive ever seen let hope deakin get it this time though im a littl asham that i havent seen ani of the best pictur nomine but i did see the desol of smaug three time   might need to have a cultur infus weekend befor march  littl surpris han zimmer didnt get nomin for 12 year a slave although the nomine are all fantast  a few year ago i would never have expect matthew mcconaughey to be an oscar nomin actor hes realli improv as of recent dalla buyer club was a realli good i applaud jare leto as well whi the heck didnt blue is the warmest color get a nomin for best foreign languag that disappoint this is the third straight year that chris pratt has appear in a best picur nomine pay attent hollywood so happi scorses was nomin with all the love it got wolf of wall street got shut out of best edit which has a veri strong correl to the eventu bp winner  go for gold leo shooter gonna choke  veri excit to see leo get an oscar nomin hope this year he walk away with it how did her not get nomin for best costum design they had the coolest cloth in that movi insid llewyn david got snub imo biggest snub goe to insid llewyn davi for score and best song i challeng anyon who is slight into folksi music or mellow acoust to check out the soundtrack it fantast  everyth els turn out near exact the way that peopl thought they would lead up to the nomin im probabl in the minor in think that barkhad abdi was mere ok in captain phillip but he was the onli pirat who wasnt a cardboard terrorist caricatur so he look complex by comparison  still havent seen wolf of wall street philomena or nebraska okay  im just go to say this know it go to be buri way down low where the vfx credit go as usual but   how in the hell doe graviti get nomin for best cinematographi it a travesti  same thing when life of pi won  did anyon watch this film  there no cinematographi  it all vfx  i work in vfx and we are alway stun and offend by this  one best vfx is at the bottom of the list  show me graviti without vfx  show me iron man 3 without vfx  we make the movi  all of them have vfx  i did 50 shot in the butler for christ sake  youll never even notic  hollywood is continu screw us and demon us when they know theyd never surviv without us    sorri rant over hope leo get it but hes got realli tough competit joaquin gerwig delpi llewyn how doe the crood keep get nomin over monster univers  the crood was an enjoy film but i would never consid it better than monster univers   did peopl forget it came out pacif rim didnt get a nomin for visual effect  crimin i realli hope leo get the oscar this year he realli deserv it no tom hank weird i thought his perform was on tom most passion power and emot artist highlight of his illustri career i think one of the biggest snub was the place beyond the pine get 0 nomin nobodi was talk about it and it came out a long time ago so i expect this to happen but that script was incred the act was great and derek cianfranc is one of the best up and come director out there i realli feel like hugh jackman should have been nomin for his role in prison as per wolf of wall street i think the academi had it superbl horrif reaction and then reflect on the fact that the film in fact elicit such strong reaction from them at all and made the adjust in the consider  i think dicaprio amp hill nomin were well deserv and i think that such a stack lead actor race need to consid their repertoir as well as their current work  imo it between dicaprio ejiofor and mcconaughey  i feel that ejiofor is a nich emot role that typic get the limelight and mcconaughey drastic method act was absolut deserv of the nomin and possibl the win i think dicaprio abil to take a fair standard charact and own it in a way that was pure act and less physic transform is someth to consid but then again it a thriller with cheap kick   this is go to come down to the wire i am overal veri happi with the nomin  im shock that i see fire from desol of smaug did not get nomin in origin song  shame that the great gatsbi didnt get much attent especi carey mulligan who in my opinion absolut nail the part and was at least as good as if not better as a support actress than those nomin all pretti predict although slight surpris to see noth for blue is the warmest color happi befor midnight got a screenplay nomin arguabl the most perfect trilog of all time  edit oh and i will be disappoint if cgi win best cinematographi again there is a visual effect categori i wish they would cut the best pictur nomin down to 5 with 9 there are some that just dont have a chanc my predict  best pictur 12 year a slave  best actor chiwetel ejiofor  best actress cate blanchett  best support actorjar leto  best support actress lupita nyongo  anim frozen  best director alfonso cuarón  best foreign the hunt  featur documentari the act of kill  film edit graviti  best cinematographi graviti  costum design american hustl  makeup and hair dalla buyer club  origin score graviti  product design her  sound edit and mix graviti  visual effect graviti   adapt screenplay 12 year a slave  origin screenplay her     steve coogan congrat i can see 12 year a slave get both oscar for the support role elysium didnt get a vfx nom no love for rush  i thought it was worthi of at least a nomin for daniel bruhl lone ranger get a makeup and hairstyl nod and american hustl doesnt object i hope leo final win surpris to see ami adam side boob didnt get a nomin 10 nomin for american hustl i mean realli it one of the most overr movi in recent year no blue is the warmest color bradley cooper over daniel bruhl damn wow no pixar movi what the fuck no insid llewyn davi  stun that blue is the warmest color shut out of foreign film   stun ctrlf leonardo dicaprio all i ask is for jare leto to win best support  that would be huge for him am i the onli one that was disappoint by american hustl it wasnt a horribl movi but i am not sure what all the hype is about it certain did not deserv best pictur when compar to 12 year a slave and dalla buyer club or even wolf of wall street the hobbit wasnt nomin for costum or hair and makeupwat unpopular opinion  wolf of wall street was the most overr movi of the year and the onli reason it got ani nomin is becaus scorsase direct it and leo act in it  both of which were mediocr  oh jonah how far youv comehttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvep52omnnzmg best pictur for me will go down between graviti and 12 year a slave  i cant see past chiwetel ejiofor as best actor did anyon notic under anim they use the wrong poster for despic me 2 the poster is from the first one matthew mcconnaughey is go to win an oscar and no one can stop him holi shit     and if leto doesnt win im go to caus quit the ruckus  american hustl and graviti both have the most with 10 each im pleasant surpris that her got all that recognit what the hellno pacif rim in visual effectsbut lone ranger get one     wat ctrlf sharknadonoth althought jare leto was veri good im hope fassbend doe win  a bit bum that there was no adapt screenplay nod for the spectacular now or best actress nod for brie larson in short term 12 both wouldv been worthi dark hors   i understand it a stack year but doe meryl streep realli need this lone ranger was nomin for best visual effect over pacif rim dont you have to see a movi to see it visual effect who the fuck saw lone ranger whi is sandra bullock nomin  american hustl is overr shit  the academi is prove yet again that the oscar are noth more than an insid circl jerk  which mean leo wont win either  they alreadi snub phoenix as a nomin clear they play favorit i saw american hustl yesterday and ill be complet honest when i say that i didnt like it at all most becaus it was bore predict and s their twist end was so obvious that it just seem stupid at one point i almost consid get up and leav becaus i was so bore it appear that they tri to make a twist end but it was obvious the entir time wolf of wall street was a much better film  graviti and american hustl both got 10 nomin if im count right 12 year a slave got nine happi to see prison at least garner some attent for it cinematographi visual it was an excel film that i thought deserv more attent upon it releas strong perform also but i feel mani of the film best aspect have been best by other film this year so im not surpris to see it not realli recognis anywher els shes not as well known as most other actor but shout out to salli hawkin make it in support actress who was so egregi snub in 2008 for happygolucki damn i didnt get one this time either so excit to see the nomin final  doe anyon know if the oscar will be avail to watch by stream simultan dure the broadcast prison got shun then bit surpris jackman didnt get a nom mayb over bale also no phoenix nom for her mayb they ought to add more nom instead of the tradit 5  the wind rise better win this was a legit year for movi prison got almost entir shut out but with the other movi that came out i cant realli even be mad root for wow im glad karen os moon song is nomin i doubt it will win but it a sweet littl song that fit perfect with the movi  how do these nomin work how is the lone ranger nomin for best visual effect and not pacif rim daniel bruhl was fuck rob of a best support oscar nomin  so bradley cooper get a nomin for basic play bradley cooper im sorri but i dont see what the big deal with this guy is  great gatsbi got 2 nod this year product design and costum design i think the entir movi was made just for that purpos although dicaprio mesmer as jay  i just saw her and wow did it earn it nomin   jennif didnt deserv her nomin graviti nomin in the music categori i dont know what to say surpris that franc ha wasnt on anyon radar this year best song will go to let it go  i realli enjoy american hustl and i think it deserv all of the nomin it receiv i thought it was one of the best movi ive seen in year  realli iron man 3 did it do anyth new or excit becaus i dont think so go leo roger deakin for prison thank god i thought it wasnt go to get ani recognit still should of gotten more rush was entir snub that is absurd that was possibl the best film of the year  what did the coen do to piss off the academi it like theyr act like insid llewyn davi doesnt exist mud im glad meryl streep final was nomin for an oscar i thought mud deserv some attent i like the great gasbi  no insid llewyn davi love fuck you sir how in the fuck are despic me 2 and the crood nomin im guess they need some placehold after frozen and the wind rise im actual most surpris upstream color didnt get an award for sound design or someth similar  i dont think i can think of a recent movi late that incorpor sound so well and so heavili while stay extrem fresh in what they were do im happi that befor midnight got a screenplay nod  im also surpris that stori we tell didnt get a nomin at all which realli disappoint me prison was massiv snub imo besid the deakin nomin which he should win wolf of wall street for best pictur sad that befor midnight didnt get more recognit as a nomine  also didnt mud come out this year wow blackfish got snub big time  from everyth ive seen this year dalla buyer club deserv everi award it was nomin for imo 12 year is overr as is american hustl and wolf  whi is it that i can never recogn who most of the actorsactress are dure the oscar same with the movi want to get start on some of the documentari i know the squar start on netflix tomorrow but what are the predict  come on leo 2014 is your year usual i can deal with the snub but this year they seem more crimin than most i mean come on no adel exarchopoulo none for blue is the warmest color i understand it was inelig for foreign film but the other categori unreal and im soo tire of these bore best pictur film like american hustl that will be forgotten in a few year david o russel is play that hollywood game like a fiddl who care it just yet anoth award show am i the onli one who didnt like graviti becaus it had no stori whatsoev is it just me or is this a pretti weak field for best pictur of cours rush and ron howard get snub realli love the song in frozen and also enjoy moon song in her i realli hope one of those win disappoint that blackfish wasnt consid for documentari i know most peopl dont care about best documentari but it make me sad that sara polley didnt get a nomin for stori we tell  grant the act of kill probabl has that categori in the bag this year but polley still did a hell of a job and i wouldv like to have at least seen her recogn as a nomine minor hurrah for this one compar to other major categori but super pleas to see prison get the cinemaphotographi nod my favorit film of the year and like it or not it hard to argu it not beauti shot it complet baffl me that pacif rim isnt nomin for best visual effect definit feel for leo but i realli dont know how anybodi other than chiwetel win best actor blackfish isnt nomin for best documentari what is the time frame for this some of these were releas in 2014 other in 2013 it never made sens to me how were none of the song from insid llewyn davi nomin graviti was an entertain movi with a great perform by bullock but it doesnt belong with the other best pictur nomine  hope leonardo final get an oscar this year just rememb not all great actor or movi need an oscar tom hank joaquin phoenix and robert redford didnt get nomin for best actor paul greengrass or spike jonz for best director beyond surpris just realli baffl blackfish didnt get ani nomin for documentari film and graviti wrack in 10 nomin up there with american hustl so mani question and probabl none will be answer graviti was likeabl but besid visual and sound effect it not worth a 2nd or 3rd sit whole movi didnt have much script to work with hard ani substanc  ani chanc barkhad abdi will win silenc   sigh  how was blue is the warmest color not nomin for best foreign languag film no blackfish for documentari crood instead of mu what graviti look great but what a woeful scripteveryth other than the oh shit im fuck in space stori was so tacki trite amp clich anyon els piss off that jake gyllenha did not get nomin in support role for prison sandra bullock for best actress  it a joke right look like philomena took the place of insid llewyn davi in some categorieswhat a shame prison got a cinematographi nomin so it wasnt complet ignor 12 year a slave should win best pictur and leo deserv that gold that all complet nonsens though not unexpect from the academi that joaquin was snub his honest perform beat out leo hey academi look at me act ani day  i cant help but notic the conspicu absenc of american cinema lead auteur mr shia labeouf  noooooooooooo my opinion my precious opinion  i did not think american hustl live up to the hype bale amp lawrenc had great perform but the movi was just soso for me the lone ranger nomin for visual effect realli that movi didnt even merit a soda and popcorn rest of the nom look pretti solid though hope leo final get his oscar i just watch 12 year a slave and i alreadi forgot the main guy performac leonardo leav a last performac everi movi hes in give him his god damn oscar i am shock and disappoint at all the peopl here take this serious as if it is a legitim fair award base upon artist effort and integr these winner have success outbrown nose their opposit not out perform them   note pleas someon explain to me whi i am wrong or crazi to think this way  american hustl is get a lot of love 12 year a slave seem to be lack in nod i alreadi see it american hustl is goon win anoth forgett oscar winner  glad ami adam final got a lead actress nomin hope she win frozen need to win it was a beauti movi with a uniqu stori line fantast visual and veri veri amaz song let it go itself deserv someth  i dont if it was just a bad year for film but i cant recal ever see so mani terribl film with so mani nomin  american hustl had two good perform and that it  wolf of wall street was funni but repetit cartooni and meander  nebraska was a good idea turn into a trite mess  graviti get oscar nom for someth besid techinc award  her screenplay was nomin for someth other than most pain expositori dialogu  and though i like the stori and the act i even found 12 year a slave to be poor written and too obvious mcqueen sure know how to kill drama  at least befor midnight screenplay got nomin meryl streep did her part perfect stir up troubl by call walt disney a racist andor sexist bastard get bad press go rangl up relet to back up the baseless bash all to get save mr bank knock out of the competit  what studio paid her off caus this is the dirtiest kind fo oscar campaign ive seen in year not a singl nomin for emma thompson whose dinner streep ruin to begin the smear campaign it a bigger travesti than insid llewyn davi think it leo turn this year no love for insid llewellyn davi or save mr bank sort of surpris at least befor midnight got a best adapt screenplay nod if dalla buyer club doesnt sweep im go to write an angri letter poor leo ani other year and he would be a shoe in for best actor but it go to chiwitel ejiofor 12 year a slave is a pwer film and sheer oscar bait itt redditor who think they know more about who should be nomin in categori x than the peopl that actual do categori x for a live wow jennif lawrenc nomin again they should renam it to award for peopl everyon like at the moment thought they would throw gandolfini a bone wow i thought they had complet ignor insid llewyn davi until it got a nomin for cinematographi and sound mix what a joke i cannot believ it didnt even get a nomin for origin song and wow the amount of attent american hustl is get ill give credit where credit is due but it doe not deserv a nomin for write or edit compar to insid llewyn davi i havent even heard of dalla buyer club  look like it may be worth some time  do we reddit do ani kind of vote to award our own oscar  ami adam oh come on she was good but to be nomin for an academi award  itt peopl complain about nomin we all know the oscar are shit anyway just like the grammi to music warn controversi opinion you will hate me  12 year a slave is overr when a movi is alreadi call out as the oscar winner everyon was say dicaprio wouldnt win again becaus of 12 year a slave and chiwetel ejiofor which is iron sinc wolf of wall street hadnt premier either peopl debat winner befor ani movi is even releas ridicul befor peopl have even seen it it overr   peopl rate movi base on how pretenti they are and how good they seem dont realli know what to call it but the way it is film and the camera filter actor theme how hype it is nobodi care about the actual movi   if im go to be strand on an island with onli one movi i can bring it sure as hell isnt go to be shawshank redempt or godfath ref  later school start time

teacher were also tire as fuckcant imagin that help improv the academ experi    delet delet for high school in particular the main reason that school hour arent move forward are sport sudden when the district move the school day ahead 2 hour angri coach and parent complain about 2 hour less for footbal basketbal etc probabl becaus there is a univers cutoff time for event in the district   so instead of attempt to improv perform in school by give student a more balanc sleep schedul most district will put sport ahead of those concern and disregard ani legitimaci in claim made by studi like these  delet delet the usual answer to this issu even express in some comment to this post is that a teen should go to bed earlier  it is an uninform answer  they first time i heard that teen should have a later start time was 45 year ago  and the answer was go to bed earlier  sleep research at the univers of california at san diego prove this was not a use answer  teen need more sleep than they get by sever hour but they cant go to sleep until their bodi want to  and for the most part teen have a lot of energi in the earli even and cant easili fall asleep befor 10 or 11pm    a common problem is that we seem fixat on 8 hour as the perfect sleep time  teen need more than that  especi young teen  ucsd studi suggest 10 hour is more the mark for age 1216 year   the bodi and brain are in a wild activ develop stage  for a teen to get enough sleep for a 730 start time they would need to go to bed and go to sleep at around 8 or 830  it isnt go to happen  probabl becaus no kid ever want to get up at 67 am to go to shitti school  the countless time id fell asleep at the desk is a testament to that year after year for at least 15 year now which is as long as i have follow this topic differ studi come out show that later high school start time are better for the student  for the teacher administr  and parent howev an earli schedul is usual better so that is how it alway stay  adult circadian rhythm respons and schedul are differ from those of adolesc and school schedul are design for those not for the student   delet there a studi on this almost year now they were talk about this crap when i was in middl school 810 year ago i dont think that this is the first time a studi has establish someth like this but it wont have ani effect on polici in the us let not kid ourselv the high school school day is organ to accommod athlet if school got out later that would throw off game time delet they need school to start earli so that parent can get their kid out of the hous befor they have to go to work they should move workday hour later too delet anyon who has ever taught know that the first class of the day is all about get through without anyon fall asleep  i spent a lot of time tri to put more energi into that class and do activ that involv move around and although the student hate me for it sometim they stay awak  if class start an hour or hour and a half later i can onli imagin the qualiti of student learn would improv i rememb read this sever time sinc i was in grade school im 25  it not new inform but school remain unchang  bachelor in psycholog and second grade teacher here i wrote about this and the need for recess our school district onli doe 10 minut in my development psycholog cours and have been write to the school district about this for year   this is anoth major issu of treat school as workequival littl play lot of work same schedul etc the american school system is tri to breed employe which is fine but at too young an age my second grader onli get 10 minut of recess per day   it infuri to see studi after studi support the idea that school violat natur circadian rhythm yet no one with a brain is abl to do anyth about it psychiatrist here i have been an advoc for later start time for high school student for year the research that is post here is just the latest but there is so more when high school student start school later in the morn they not onli get more sleep but their grade improv they are on time more often and skip fewer school day there is also an improv in mental health one studi show that there were fewer drive accid among high school age driver with later start time    sleep depriv kid are more like to use drug and alcohol and yes they get diagnos with adhd more often  re the difficulti in switch bus schedul around some school district have accomplish it alreadi it can be done if the interest parti can be brought togeth   if you want this chang to happen in your area you should do two thing  1 show the research to peopl do present at your local school but more import for the local decis maker school board etc in other word be an activist  2 point out that some school district have alreadi done it it make it harder for peopl to say it is imposs  if you are look for the refer you need to make your case consid use this book sleep starvedhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb00d3q08vi i wrote it and put all the refer in so other can use them for their own present and project there is a chapter on sleep depriv and kid    as an educ im fascin by the number of studi that suggest certain learn style or teach practic may be more effect and million get dump into overhaul curriculum for fad curriculum   but a studi like this that has been redon and confirm multipl time everyon just ignor it it like nobodi is afraid of chang just chang that might actual accomplish someth  in a strang emerg properti kind of way this make it so morn peopl will get better grade succeed and move into posit of power and the cycl repeat  delet to play devil advoc what about those with after school event especi in high school  you may start school late but when you get out later and then go to whatev extracurricular you have and eat dinner there doesnt seem to be much time left for homework so you stay up late into the night to finish it a time when your bodi is tell you i should be asleep it dark outsid so theyr distract  also how late is late in my high school experi it was 8320 these day i hear it 845345 delet delet as a former student of a high school with an 8am start time yes i concur with this studi earli morn suck this is probabl part of the reason i did way better in colleg than in high school class at my univers never start befor 9 am with a few except but they were not class id take anyway on averag i start around 10 or 11 am gave me all the time i need to wake up in the morn eat clean up get readi arrang my materi and thought for the day and by the time i was out the door i was readi for the world  i onli graduat this past may but for student like me who had to work into the morn and need the job it was veri inconveni id get home some time as late as one oclock and i had to be awak around six oclock and though i hate it the job and hour were pretti import at the time and i couldnt go without   point be it just seem like it would be better all around if the school oper at later time ani highschool student could tell you this i spent most of my highschool year struggl to stay awak the first half of the day  the best solut to this issu is a shorter school day and more class through the summer  kid arent need at home to work on the farm for three month anymor  summer break is too long and is a serious interrupt for their educ   studi like that have been come out sinc at least the 1990s my school has registr at 845 and lesson from 9 til 320pm i think the children would simpli refus to go to school earlier than that im in my last year so i onli studi three subject and general studi onc a week so i bare ever start at 9 normal at 10 but sometim not until 1130  here in san diego my high school has start to recogn this and now has a late start day at 930 everi other wednesday it has realli improv our test score and the school mood as a whole has never been better we normal start at 730current my first period is ap world histori a colleg level histori cours that allow me to get a 425 gpa  my grade in there was a low c and when we start these late start ive shot up to a low a  teenag are design and inclin to stay up late and wake up late make elementari school start late and high school start earli is stupid in my opinion the onli reason they do that is becaus of sport after school although i get out after my sister in elementari school start befor her and end after her not ok wow i was expect later than 820 i am from the uk and my first lesson or period of the day begin at 910 and i still think that too earli make school start time later would be a huge benefit to student with add sinc they tend to do their bestmost work at night 10pm2am if your up until 2am do a paper and the bus come at 645 that is not enough sleep for anyon school start when it doe to accommod the corpor schedul impos on the parent it has littl to do with what benefit the child i skip a crap ton of school and it wasnt caus i was do drug or hang out with friend i just want to sleep good thing they start to learn peopl like sleep  ive alway thought this my high school start class at 725 am i couldnt wrap my head around how anyon expect us to learn anyth befor 8 the fact that everi person whos ever been an adolesc know this and tri to chang it when they were one  i use to have to go to school at 800 am but i move to texa and now dont have to go until 900 am i can easili say that i am definit a lot more energet dure the day and dont fall asleep dure class anymor even though i go to bed later than i use to so that whi i had to get up at 530am for school then again my high school was pretti lousi we were an abstin onli nonevolut kind of school when i start to struggl in algebra they found it easier to get a waver so i didnt have to do math than to help me get over the hump probabl whi i spent two year in a communiti colleg learn to write and do math of which i cant say enough good thing about communiti colleg  can confirm  first two year of high school were hell i had straight as except for a b in my first morn class it was a health class whi did i have a b in a health class becaus i couldnt stay awak dure the fuck class whi couldnt i stay awak dure the fuck class becaus i had to get up at six to be there on time  fast foward to junior year and im in a program that let me take class on a colleg campus to get colleg and high school credit i get up at 730 i live like 5 minut from the campus and my first class start at 8 had a 40 last semest becaus i could actual be awak for my first class that extra hour and a half realli make a big differ go from a middl school where school start at 7am and i had to get up at 5 everi morn to a high school where school start at 9 and i get up a littl befor 8 this is total true this was news 20 year ago this doe not make public of this ani less valid im just astound that there still need to be research and public on this point if i rememb correct my school district dismiss this base on parent of elementari school children object to the transport schedul  it took them this long to do actual studi on this  i start school at 900 can confirm sleep is good i would have enjoy high school so much more if i had simpli been abl to get up 2 hour earlier the idea that high school student have to be at what is consid their job way befor the normal 95 work class has to is insan now that im in colleg and i get to make sure all my class start at 10am or later im have a much more enjoy experi i had a feel it wasnt all becaus i was stupid it was that damn 8am class  damn biolog i can person attest to this becaus my high school start at 9am less student are late becaus they have more time in the morn and are general more awak first period than my friend school that start at 8ish our middl school bus use to pick us up at 605 am for a 730 am start time i should also mention i hate middl school noth but anim in that place base our children educ on scienc ive never heard anyth so absurd i feel like this was old news when i studi educ in colleg and i graduat in the year 2000 i just dont understand there been plenti of studi that show start school later  especi for teenag  is veri benefici so whi havent ani school start time chang as a teacher i support later start time  if not for the student then for the teacher  id love to sleep past 530 onc in a while had school from 9240 in highschool it was beauti this isnt new the educ system has primarili been design at the conveni of adult both teacher amp parent be both a daycar and employ centr as well as an educ facil  as a futur high school teacher i hope to god this chang not onli for the sake of the student whose learn abil falter but for the teacher too there no way i can teach enthusiast at 7 in the morn even if it about a topic i enjoy then again i shouldnt get my hope up my freshmen year of hs i start school at 730 and it suck big time i move to san antonio befor my sophomor year where class start at 900 it was awesom   we got out at 4pm but that was fine by me i often had soccer practic after so i got home right as dinner was be serv which was also awesom   i still went to bed around 10 or 11 pm so i was well rest  no shit someon els thought that start school at 730 am might be bad for your health at the one point in your life when sleep is crucial it probabl is becaus school doubl as day care but i also alway thought they were train us to work in the real world my high school teacher alway went on those rant in colleg your not go to be abl to sleep in do parent think kid whine about earli school becaus it fun or someth i grew up in the uk where school start at 9am now i live in the usa and i just dont understand the earli start here  especi for teenag this probabl would also appli to employe in mani situat luckili for my line of work i can set my own schedul and work from my home i have alway notic that i work much more effici when i wake with the sun the day i do have to wake up befor the sun is when i becom letharg throughout the day diminish the speed of  and qualiti of my work  this is the one thing that realli hurt me in high school no matter how long i was go to school i could never get use to wake up that earli my home town pass an ordin requir the high school get a late start we start at 9 and end at 315 extracurricular usual went till 630 as a result high school was awesom this is most done so that the highschool kid will be home in time to look after their younger sibl while their parent are at work so were sacrif learn for conveni  i live in the netherland and here kid age 4 till 12 go to school from 830 till 15001530 1300 on wednesday they then go home or to daycar play with toy and do their homework have dinner and after dinner at around 1800 to go to their sportstrain match are dure the weekend this is becaus most coach are volunt and they have day job  i never had an sleep troubl when i was a kid go to school at 645730 at state by someon in the repli sound like hell  edit i forget to say that school hard have extracurricular activ sport music danc is all arrang by club that are not associ with school and which are run by volunt and most pay for by the govern just like your boy scout in the us i went to a night school program for the last year and a half of high school it start at 4pm and end at 10pm my perform skyrocket and my life general improv veri quick it was hard for peopl to understand my sleep cycl but i was 16 and am convinc it was necessari   now almost done with colleg i can wake up earli and get thing done im convinc puberti and adolesc requir a differ sleep schedul in my case   they had this knowledg when i was in high school and instead of use it most school seem to make the day start earlier and earlier of cours it doe of cours it doe weve known this forev the problem is that after school activ like sport domin the scholast polit rhelm and we would never move thing like game and practic to late night if we cant move those then we cant move school later we consistan make choic that harm the wellb of a child educ for the desir of those who want to watch them run and throw a ball into a hoop im not say athlet have no place or valu but at a point they stand in the way of the true intent of educ eve known this forev the problem is that after school activ like sport domin the scholast polit rhelm and we would never move thing like game and practic to late night if we cant move those then we cant move school later we consistan make choic that harm the wellb of a child educ for the desir of those who want to watch them run and throw a ball into a hoop im not say athlet have no place or valu but at a point they stand in the way of the true intent of educ  that still insan earli  i live in northern ireland and pretti much all of the school start at 900 and in my school class dont actual start until 925 and finish at 330 i dont know how you could manag to be in school and alert at 8 im usual just get up then our educ system need to be torn down and built from the ground up in all honesti but that pretti much an imposs task  if you gave most of human anoth hour in the morn peopl would be a lot happier  9  10 is a joke major of peopl just simpli dont do anyth that product between the hour of 9  10 you get menial task done to prepar for the day of work etc  yet you want kidsteenag to actual learn someth in that time period dont make me laugh  a better system in my opinion would be peopl start at 10 take 2 hour to prep for the big rush that happen after lunch tie up lose end take care of ani emerg etc even take a nap or get serious work done a concentr 2 hour on a task is better than 3 hour of we almost no one i find can remain concentr for 3 hour straight in the morn  12 o clock have lunch be well fed launch into the rush that happen after lunch then come 5 oclock you can stay to work anoth hour or go home compani can veto this decis if it a busi or quiet day they can make a save of an hour worth of their employe time by keep the number they need on while send everyon els home  kid that go home at 5 get pick up etc kid that go home at 6 can mayb get some help with their homework for an hour so it not such a stress when they get home they could get fed at school or we this would also divid traffic peopl pick up their kid at 5 and 6 would split the overal rush to pick up your kid etc  so pros compani save money you get an extra hour in bed less traffic potenti less stress with your kid when you get home you can stay up later if your a night owl  consish you work till 6 but you were there for 10 anyway you could potenti lose an hour of work but if this was a big deal perhap the compani would allow a system for overtim gtstudi find later school start time improv sleep and daytim function in adolesc  did they not also find that everyth is better with later start time we pretti much know that start school later in the day would be better at this point it is not lead to ani chang in how thing are done can my 9 am colleg class time be move to noon  delet i wonder if there are addit posit extern that might be associ  most school start between 730830 which also happen to be prime rush hour traffic  start school at 9 might serious improv citi traffic flow in some area and better dissip overal congest  also consid the obes problem  most peopl will tell you that breakfast is the most import meal of the day  this is not entir wrong simpli becaus some other studi have shown that a healthi breakfast can mitig a tendenc to overeat later in the day  i know in high school i often overslept and ran out the door without eat back in 98 we had a polici debat resolut about high school  i ran a case about late start high school  the research was just unassail  in 98  this is old news but sport and the status quo mental mean chang on this issu is unlik despit a lot of evid for this idea and reduc qualiti of life for teacher and their famili canadian here when i was in high school the first period start at 830am and it hasnt chang to my knowledg i think that more than reason i was abl to wake up at 715730am or so shower chang and run out to the bus for 800am which would get me to school with about 10 min to spare each day was like clockwork no complaint i would go to bed at 1000pm at the latest each night so i would alway get enough sleep the night befor i would have my bag pack with whatev booksmateri i would need for the next day and id have my lunch made and in the fridg readi to grab and go  i knew other kid who had farther to go but due to how catchment area for high school work if you live over a certain distanc away you pretti much were not given the option to attend a school too far away you were to attend whatev was closest if there was onli one in your area i knew a lot of peopl at my school who came from farther away than myself the worst case i knew about was a guy whom it took an hour to get to school by transit so he had to be up at around 645700am get readi and catch his bus at 730am i still dont even think that too bad it just meant he went to bed a bit earlier i never heard him complain either  some peopl in this thread seem to be say that some us  school start at 730am in my opinion that too earli they should take a lesson from canada as a senior in highschool i can confirm first 3 year of highschool woke up at 6am everi morn and had shit grade transfer school my last year and im abl to wake up at 830 and havent had better grade all my year of school if so mani peopl hate wake up earli and deal wiht the morn drudg then whi dont they just chang this shit alreadi i sure wish school had start later when i was a student i had a newspap rout that i had to deliv everi morn befor school that meant get up at 5 or 515 at the latest each morn by the time school roll around i was so tire i would fall asleep in class constant even in the middl of test i would pass out partway in and wake up when the test end onli have complet a small part of it   im a parent now but i definit support later start time for the kid this make too much sens  i hate how my hardest comput scienc class are alway at 8 am  like come on wtf they are also find that a decreas in car accid involv teenag driver is associ with later school start time some state in the us are track and monitor these statist i believ the first report of it kind was releas late last year sourc npr we fight this battl in my home and in my experi as they get older it get more difficult we move from a differ time zone between be an hour ahead now and have an earlier start time it like wake up in the middl of the damn night they went from a 915a to 225p school day which is 1015325p our current time to get up at 530a for a 715300pm schedul the perk is we have a longer summer break the downsid no one is get enough sleep i see a huge chang in emot health as far as posit attitud and mood on break and weekend in which they sleep 1013 hour in order to get that dure the school week they would have to go to bed 3 hour after dinner this is from person experi but i was and still am one of those peopl who who have troubl with earli class when i was in high school i receiv a few detent for be repeat tardi i just couldnt get up in the morn i wasnt a bad student and my attend was near perfect i was just late 10 year later im the same way i have 9am class in colleg everi weekday this semest i went to bed at midnight and woke up today at 8am but i feel letharg i keep yawn im have troubl concentr if i had stay up until 2am and woke up at 10am i would be fine the same amount of sleep at differ time of the day make a huge differ for me   tldr i cant function in the  morn no matter how much sleep i get while i was in hs i did a research paper on this topic there have been numer studi with the same find like this over the year other studi also found that it could lower the rate of depress and tardi for hs student and student that took the same class later in the day score higher than those student that took the same class in the morn well except for right after lunch p   was also so much harder to do this research when suffer the effect of sleep depriv as i often was in hs i alway want to shut the book and go to sleep when read about all the horribl thing exacerb by sleep depriv  no matter how mani studi come out with evid support this claim school system will never chang  that becaus the unit state educ system is train it student to be dilig factori worker who need to be there befor 9 am and know how to work relat complex machineri  our gdp was built on our factori and  wait what  all factori work was outsourc in the 70s and 80s  so the primari reason for the start time be so earli despit grow evid that more would be learn if start time were later for adolesc has been taken away  what give then  end theatric this has been known for quit a long time now there have been studi on this that have shown the same for decad the thing is it doesnt matter becaus school schedul arent design to even consid what best for the student school schedul are design around what is most conveni for the teacher and administr for the school system itself   a larg part of this is extracurricular the us school system focus so much on extracurricular often more so than normal school that the schedul is actual built around accommod them rather than student suggest cut down focus on thing like footbal would get you lynch in a lot of town back when i play varsiti basketbal the bus would often not get back to school until around 11pm or occasion even after midnight this was despit school get out at 230 the reason for this was becaus game were schedul as freshman then jv then varsiti all play on the same day at the same school this seem stupid if it mean get home and leav the kid 6 hour of sleep or less but it make perfect sens from an administr point of view it take buse to transport kid it take staff to work the concess stand peopl to work the scoreboard ref etc it far more conveni for administr to onli have to do this onc than for 3 day in a row whi use 3 bus driver or have somebodi drive the bus 3 day in a row when you can just do it onc and get it over with the wellb of the student is actual far from the top prioriti   tldr school schedul are not design for student wellb they are entir base on conveni for staff and the school system itself  i would say the same thing appli to adult who have to work earli morn or overnight job we get shift work sleep disorderhttpenwikipediaorgwikishift_work_sleep_disord or swsd becaus we have to work when we normal would be sleep whi employ think that drag us out of bed to work when it still dark out is somehow good for the compani when we are probabl at our least product is a mysteri to me give us a coupl more hour to sleep and well get a lot more done becaus we are rest amp fulli awak but nothat not the way the world work in the land of bluecollar job   former teacher here this is not new inform there have been mani studi that support this idea sad school schedul are set up for the conveni of the parent not for the benefit of the student school here start at about 730 in the morn to make sure that there is time for them to get to work by eight this will be the biggest barrier to make ani real chang in this area interest it would appear that earli start time are better for sophomor and up univers student   sourc i was take a poo in the bathroomon on reddit do i feel the overwhelm need to clarifi this when a coupl math professor and a scienc professor walk in talk about it summer vacat should be shorten as well i somehow doubt it would actual help in the longrun becaus peopl will simpli go to bed later i have all my cours in the afternoon which mean i regular sleep until 1 pm get up at 10 am is horribl for me  instead peopl should use less artifici light after sunset studi find that go to bed at a reason hour also improv daytim function  thank you scienc for prove what all of us unhappili discov in our gruesom teenag year  anoth reason high school start so earli is so they can end earli leav an entir afternoon free for sport and other extracurricular to pad your colleg app as with everyth the illog set up of the schoolday is onli one symptom of a system attitud problem if our valu shift so would this  rnoshitsherlock delet make logic sens if you think about it it kinda obvious i dont know whi educ havent caught onto it sooner yeah it almost as if sleep help peopl function what an amaz discoveri delet delet i function better if i just dont go to school in general  im play devil advoc here but part of have school start dure workday hour is like to encourag student to get use to function on the practicaltyp schedul of the rest of the world in which theyll someday hope contribut a product role  my local school system was one of the first in the area to push the start time for high schooler back and instead make the middl schooler go in earlier and the chang have been notic the parent were concern about extracurricular activ but the realiti of it is so what they are do what they do until a bit later the last thing a 15 or 16 year old probabl want to do is watch the sunris i still didnt sleep much in highschool but i at least usual had enough to make it through the school day  in colleg i never got the luxuri i see most peopl here talk about unfortun there arent mani physic major and thus not differ class offer if the class i need is at 8am then i am take an 8 am that onli happen onc howev i dont think anyon thought that earlier start time were better for sleep habit parent who work need their young children out of the hous earli older children have after school activ sport andor job this is interest back in my freshman year of high school our school was so overcrowd that the administr had to split the day into three schedul 700 to noon 1000 to 300 and 1100 to 500 i had the latest schedul and it was the best i would get up at 9 am everi morn and feel total awak dure class the onli downsid was have no time at all to do homework after school  im australian we start school at 900am and finish at 320pm  im curious what time do other countri start school  im awar privat school and some public school can differ in time but where i live 9320 is standard my high school move back the start time from 830 to 900 for that veri reason also most peopl had to commut about 3045 minut to get there our school day was veri long as we didnt get out of school until 400pm but if you had sport you were go to be there anyway  i wish all high school provid a later start date i realli did feel more product as i usual didnt go to sleep until 200am typic teenag and my grade did actual go up after they made the adjust  ive been say this for year i just woke up it 530 in alaska i feel better about go to school attend my class with my monoton professor i use to hate wake up for class when i was in highschool it is just more enjoyablebear when your awak to actual process the inform be taught i still have a problem go to bed earli which suck it seem with these thing that you can replac the word studi with common sens and it will make just as much sens as befor if not more  just in adolesc  i would think later work start time would improv sleep and daytim functioningproduct in adult too   one reason for this is that the portion of the brain that regul the sleep cycl is not develop until earli to mid 20s in mani adolesc  i made damn sure i never had a colleg class earlier than 10am and i still fail half of my class lol must mean that studi has some sort of magic effect on grade this is all well and good but if school start later then that mean after school practic and activ must start later and end later this will give a lot of kid less time to actual do homework or have free time at home the school day would have to be shorten  i dont doubt the scienc but now that it over im kind of glad i had to kill myself to wake up all those year in school   i believ it did make me more disciplin general and did prepar me for real life situat where you have to do someth you realli dont want to do   now im sure there way to learn those adult skill without compromis function but i wonder how much that realli happen end old man rant can this be appli to full time job as well pleas  i think it becaus teenag dont sleep at all anymor everyon i know doesnt sleep so it doesnt shock me that sleep more would help brain function  i have no real issu get up at 6 in the morn except dure the winter becaus it dark dark morn just outright suck oh man what i wouldnt have given to be a part of this studi _ in my high school we would start school an hour late on wednesday so faculti could have meet and grownup thing whatnot the idea was to help student get an extra hour rest and help our mental cognit dure class it was a good idea realli except my circl of friend would take that hour to smoke pot befor class start wake and bake the issu with push back high school start time is extracurricular  someon on the footbal team would have next to no free time on school day  i wonder if they also studi what happen if the kid go to bed at a reason time my high school start at 710 you all a bunch of bitch lol liter everi singl high schooler ever could tell you this without need a studi to back it up teenag realli do need more sleep dure puberti it is the time they are grow the most in their lifetim besid infanc dure this time there is also a shift in their circadian rhythm melatonin releas help with fall asleep and in the teen year the time of this releas start get later it call the sleep phase delay so they sleep later and wake up later im sure everyon has notic this here some more inform on this  httpsleepcenteruclaedubodycfmid63     when i was in high school everi two week we would get a late arriv and start at 930 am as oppos to 800 am it may not seem like much but it was nice when we got to go in late  surpris  said no one ever wouldnt later school start time mean kid go to sleep later thus cancel out the effect of start later just myself but i think a minor flaw in this is that it was just a modifi time to which student have becom accustom to colleg is a great exampl where kid who no class until atleast 12pm or even 1pm still have sleep issu this studi just took kid who were accustom to sleep until 8am then gave them an extra 25 minut perhap if the studi was continu the same negat trend would later be found even at the delay start time  this is news  there was a similar studi at least a decad ago show the exact same thing we need a studi to find this out general speak this is common knowledg among adolesc mani of my friend are senior this year and they dont have to begin school until 1000 sometim in high school most student can be up veri earli into the night and if they had a schedul which allow for compens of those lost hour then it would be benefici for both the teacher and student this remind me of a lewi black bit where he explain the reason he flunk a cours was becaus it was taught so earli in the morn like the professor was tri to keep all of the cours inform a secret this has got to be one of the most useless studi ever anybodi could tell you this peopl are not built for a singl sleep in a day we have a clock it call the sun unless you are in alaska then im happi to hear you can smoke weed soon  this didnt need a studi it logic when i was in hs it start  730 all i want to do was sleep for like the first 3 periodshad math 1st period brutual  the rational i alway heard for the earli start was to give time for extracurricular activ after school  as a grade 10 high school student with sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep disord and possibl melatonin imbal i near fail grade 9 becaus the school start at 8 and i simpli could not stay awak im glad to see that the studi prove what i alreadi pretti much knew was true late school time in colleg as a young adult just mean i will be more like to skip  guess same goe for morn class though studi find i didnt think it took anyth more than common sens to figur out that kid dont to good when they are tire get six and a half hour of sleep and you just figur this out lol but sad it probabl wont chang post more terribl fact about cigarett im on day 4 of quit and it help   edit you guy fuck rock thank you for all the encourag it realli is help a lot  i thought that was the point of smoke cigarett the nicotin i dont see how this is necessarili a bad thing i rememb read someth a few year ago argu that light cigarett may actual be wors sinc they contain less nicotin but especi compar to everyth els in a cigarett the nicotin is pretti benign so you have to smoke more cigarett to get the same amount of nicotin mean your inhal more smoke and tar and whatnot  i quit smoke two year ago i was a moder smoker like about 8 cig a day now i look at this statist and think it pretti horribl but back when i smoke i wouldv thought it was a good thing for exampl if there was a brand that boast about more nicotin i probabl wouldv tri it out nonsmok see this and believ it a way to get peopl addict fasterand theyr right howev peopl who smoke and dont want to quit could see this as a way for the compani to save them money the logic is that the more nicotin a product has the less often youll need to use it and buy it i guess my point is that although it is pretti sinist of tobacco compani to rais nicotin level just keep in mind that there is a decent demand to do so from peopl who like smoke and dont want to quit as if it the nicotin that is evil and not the smoke inhal  as a smoker awesom  keep it come just recent quit on my sixth day and this has given me more resolv thank am i the onli one who think this is a good thing fewer cigarett need to get the nicotin buzz should theoret result in fewer cigarett smoke   mayb my logic isnt right on this ive smoke a pack a day for the past 10 year exclud the past 13 day in which ive had none as per this thread seem like good time to quit  i quit four day ago and have never felt better the nicotin in cigarett is almost unrecogniz from it origin state the tobacco compani add in multipl other danger and toxic substanc in order to speed the absorpt and metabol of the nicotin   maoi resent in tobacco smoke serv to make the reward of smoke greater in the brain by block or slow the breakdown of dopamin releas by nicotin  it has alway been a goal of the us tobacco vendor to make a more addict cigarett i work in the legal profess at one time and had access to the intern communic of one veri larg us manufactur they refer to addict as brand loyalti they spent million of dollar on research design to produc a more potent form of nicotin  edit my inform was obtain as part of the legal team prepar for the tobacco trial strict email communic between various faction of the tobacco industri i found the inform and the judg decid if it was factual consid how low the nicotin in cigarett is anyway and the fact that nicotin itself isnt what make cigarett danger i dont see the big deal good give me more  i dont smoke the thing becaus i enjoy the health benefit and sweet strawberri tast i smoke em becaus im addict to nicotin  the increas trend in yield is not relat to variat in nicotin content but to the yieldtocont ratio  cigarett havent got ani more nicotin in them there are fewer weaker cigarett all pack should be label with the nicotin and tar level this has been done in japan for at least 20 year it creat a market incent to produc less harm cig gt previous both cigarett maker have argu that chang in their nicotin yield had to do with year to year agricultur variat that may have produc tobacco crop with more concentr level of nicotin depend on the amount of rainfal for exampl  istr that a few year ago it came out that the tobacco industri deliber manipul the nicotin content of cigarett isnt that whi peopl smoke cigarett   for the nicotin      i never realli understood how cigarett compani are the devil and alcohol compani are worship  you never hear about alcohol su alcohol produc this isnt your parent tobacco wherea weed has a 215 thc increas sinc like yesterday  i stop eat mcdonald by teach my to be disgust by the food the restaur and just about everi aspect of their be even the thought of it make me sick  im go to do the same with cigarett and be finish with them forev  i hate the fact that im a smoker amp wish i never start ive tri to quit mani time but i turn into an emot cranki wreck everytim it realli is the most addict thing on earth mayb one day i will final find it within myself to quit  ive quit the analogu varieti but am now hook on fuck e cig becaus theyr so easi to smoke  in the car at work etc im smokingtak in more nicotin than i ever have done  need more willpow i guess the onli thing wors than nonsmok are exsmok  mind your own fuck busi i dont understand peopl who look down upon smoker lighten up a bit peopl are go to do thing you wouldnt do   smoke obvious feel good some peopl can just smoke onc and never again but the major smoke onc like it then smoke again it becom more frequent addict follow but you dont care at least for a while it feel good   what the point in treat smoker like dumb subhuman yes i fuck know smoke caus numer health problem you know what els caus health problem live   were all go to die sometim soon you might die from the combin effect of all those big mac youv eaten you might die becaus you never work out youll almost certain die as a result of someth you could have chang earlier in your life so you die your way and ill die mine   sorri if this is harsh but damn peopl think theyr so enlighten becaus they arent kill themselv with cigarett whi is reddit so fuck against smoke chill out let peopl do what they want at the same time best of luck to all those quit this is good sinc peopl will need to smoke fewer cigarett like an unintent side effect of farmer tri to grow better tobacco crop i person do not understand how nonsmok and exsmok are so quick to jump down a smoker throat i understand that it not the healthiest thing to do and i understand that it prevent but it has becom social accept to tell smoker how disgust and appal they are youd think live and let live but no if someon is smoke it perfect accept to tell them how disgust and stupid they are   it isnt social accept for anyth els it not okay to go up to barfli and say the amount you drink is so repuls you make me sick to my stomach and then give an essay about how unhealthi it is to drink it also not accept to walk up to an obes person at mcdonald and tell them what a terribl decis they are make and how it go to shed x amount of year off of their live   can someon explain whi it okay to shame smoker so much that almost fall in line with tax increas aaaahaha while complaint of the potenc of weed go up prolifer probabl becaus the tobacco is bred for higher nicotin level im curious whether these result mean it will make it that much harder to quit have ani of you who have tri recent and found it harder to quit than in the past i think the vape trend is interest especi sinc peopl seem to find that it help them quit better than other product two year and chang of not smoke it onli get easier peopl i think you can quit 1990 is when i start smoke  no wonder smoke is now 15 more enjoy i went travel for four

disgust cancer and rot imag they put on the pack canada and the social alien of the smoker  these arent your dad cigarett   gotta compens for all those peopl quit somehow bunch of quitter in here ive

yet hey you fucker do the research stop it ok just fuck stop it the tobacco compani need their loyal custom to keep exist and employ peopl  i see his point televis allow for the creation of a whole univers where you can focus on so mani charact without lose track of the overal stori take game of throne for exampl if they had to make one movi for each season  it wouldnt work at all most film are extrem formula and that what make them such an unattract prospect creativ im sure the money is sweet though take 10 hour to tell a stori allow for much more nuanc and multicharact develop which is whi peopl get so attach to tv charact  my guess is that with product model like that of true detect where everi season has a differ set of director writer and actor  more hollywood star will definit want to get into televis shit that would have been profound two year ago  is this realli an argument the complex stori and narrat that can be told in ten if not hundr of hour should trump a 90 minut featur ani time i see him now all i can think of is his insan blowuphttpwwwhuffingtonpostcom20090408billybobthorntongives_n_184948html when he was be interview about his band not too surpris more money is tie up in a movi which mean peopl want to take far fewer risk while still expens a tv show budget is consider less ahhhbilli bob creat creativ environmentshttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvijws6qyy7bw wherev he goe  canadian are general not a fan of this douch the biggest problem is that less peopl in the us and other western countri are go to the theater so movi are be market to china and other eastern countri with emerg citizen with some buy power while that a great thing in general in term of movi make it mean product compani and their backer need movi to appeal to all peopl of all cultur simultan to make sure theyr a sure bet that mean bigger flashier and larg dumber product and less creativ control for the screenwrit director and produc   as for normal tv it is most just as dumb down as ever in an effort to appeal to a wide viewer base what has becom the excit medium is cabl televis amc hbo fx as well as internet compani netflix and amazon becaus of their willing to back smaller show with less mainstream appeal in an effort to carv out their own nich with prestig project that garner critic acclaim and a demograph while smaller that is veri loyal and typic of a higher socioeconom level that appeal to advertis or subscriptionbas model  i agre tv has alway had the potenti to be a more creativ environ becaus it allow for longer more sinuous charact arc and detail plot develop and the potenti to captur a larg audienc week after week im just not sure the cost was worth it in the past individu film canist cost well over 1000 i suspect digit technolog and view media comput pausabl televis have made a big differ in this transit  think of how aw game of throne would be as a movi that would onli allow 2 hour a book and they alreadi use 10 becaus of the tv show  on the flip side lord of the ring or harri potter as tv show would have allow for a ton more content from the book to make it in true detect blew me away with it product valu write and stellar cast   it look like bbthorton say what everi alist serious actor feel  this is a winwin for audienc and creativ  it onli becaus well promot film that dont reli on sex cgi action sequenc or a varieti of other cheap gimmick that explor theme in depth show an artistri in film make and act where dialogu and visual shot can carri the film over action sequenc famous peopl cameo and so forth  simpli dont exist anymor  some good movi still exist and theyr still made  but they are hidden treasur on netflix they tend to be these littl underpromoto independ film you never hear of  you have to work to find them  kubrick if aliv and under a differ name  couldnt surviv in today market movi like taxi driver wouldnt get made either   director like wes anderson or lar von trier wouldnt be talk about unless they were alreadi establish from previous decad  and i think the one thing that annoy is that tv requir a plot  especi serial drama like lost or break bad  even if the goal post of those plot shift     film increas reli on plot  but film has the luxuri of not be about plot sometim a film can be about evok a feel in a viewer  lynch work is a great exampl of this  especi someth like eraserhead  this is someth tv cannot do    tv has to be built to sell ad or to keep you watch and obsess with it long enough to justifi purchas a servic like netflix  so there are these constraint on the medium of what it can and cannot do  film  for the most part  is turn into porn  not nuditi porn and hell  nuditi is almost complet absent from movi nowaday as is ani matur adult sexual  but it just exploit of sex exploit of violenc  not just violenc but costless violenc that doesnt mean anyth deeper than what a video game would provid  it all flash and glammer  it just blockbust circl jerk  if it not omg this is go to be the most epic thang ever that can be follow up with merchand no one in ani signific number care anymor  music are most a relic of the past adult drama movi are too complex charact and theme are as well  tv has just provid a littl more depth to the soap opera   gthe said cinema was now about churn out action movi broad comedi and movi where appar vampir are all model  gtif you want to be an actor get on a realli good seri in televis becaus there where it at  wasnt this alway the case am i miss someth he has a good point but it alreadi agre upon and who give a fuck what bbt think movi peopl are snob if they dont see that tv as a medium is vital of cours tmz and kardashian certain hurt the argument  billi bob thornton on what sophist that just beauti  pleas explain vanilla ice goe amish and storag war make sens sinc you can give multipl perform in tv dure the cours one film is present to the audienc most show on basic network tv continu to be crap though im see a lot of comment about how through the longer time frame afford to show tv allow for more charact and plot develop i complet agre and have been say this for a while as other have also comment but the main exampl crop up is game of throne and while this is complet accur i think it import to also point out show like the offic which got such a long run that by the end the develop of charact and plot was unfathom deep similar battlestar galactica as a movi wouldv featur mayb one giant space battl with one or two big charact grow choic by the captain but the tv format allow for a seri of such event over time highlight by a bunch of preced plot point and charact choic that lead up to a specif action by the captain that sort of develop give the audienc such a sens of understand and appreci for charact abov what a movi can creat this make me wish all movi seri had been made as tv seri   harri potter would have been a sick tv show they could spend far more time with voldemort and the rest of the crew entir episod dedic to side charact men in black basic a cop show but star will smith obvious the superhero would have been great but it cheaper to make those anim   film are better in certain case stori that are brilliant due to their simplic and minim like drive but yes in ani case where there is a whole univers involv often the case with adapt from literatur miniseri or full on tv seri are a nobrain in term of execut except that both have so much advertis that most peopl refus to watch either   say tv could be better than movi is a touch base off of realiti tv is wors than movi becaus you are watch more commerci   addblock  stream gt tvmovi i basic came to this same realiz over the past year  i can bare find a movi that i want to see yet my dvr is constant load up with great tv especi cabl show that i bare can keep up with   we dont even bother look for a movi to rent as it larg a wast of time ani more  seem like the movi portfolio has boil down to  ridicul shootemup action movi remak or sequel   i cant look at that pic but i cant stoplook  hour after see complet averag actor like jonah hill get nomin i total agre it still a differ medium a movi tell a complet stori in a coupl hour a tv show if success take year to tell a stori movi studio have been think of way to get peopl to go to the movi  less peopl go  more peopl redbox or netflix  the ad revenu for show seem more profit in the long run then a singl movi  big movi spend huge amount of money on market  for the past seven year domest pampa has account for 3437 of combin product and domesticreleas cost for movi releas by the six largest studio  tv have their network to promot it and can reach a broad amount of peopl by put the show ad on differ type of show or sport   httpwwwhollywoodreportercomnewsdoesmoviemarketingmatter24514 there is as much generic bad tv as there are generic bad movi i like how this guy say it  httpjimleffblogspotcom201206mustctvhtml for actor to work in is key here that from an actor stand point a way to if your lucki get lost in a complex charact for year tv is still a differ medium than cinema motion pictur theyr not compar compar say mad men or break bad to avatar or graviti is like compar great beer to shot or someth  total random but whi doe billi bob alway look so good in his movi but so damn messi in real life i think he liter give zero fuck about his appear when not on screen i agre with him  tv has more flexibl with stori and charact develop  the onli problem is that some show instead of just end a stori will just go on and on and on  i am look at you offic  flexibl has it downsid too  network seem to cancel show too fast  firefli deadwood and better off ted are just a few exampl of show that didnt have their fair share imho  it is good that amazon and netflix are get into the produc side and with the money that they are throw down per episod is pay off  i now tell peopl when they ask me my favorit recent movi all i can think of say is have you seen blacklist jame spader is awesom no shit look at all the movi recent sequel after sequel of shit there are no good origin movi anymor  film have becom too pg13 to capit on all movi goersbutt his has hurt the integr f the movi industri i usual onli watch independ and foreign film now cant stand the putrid hollywood trash that come out these day  so billi bob read that articl in time when they said the same thing dure the period lost west wing and soprano were in their prime  dont rememb the year it was publish but i do rememb the crown i had put in that visit look up billi bob on googl and his offici websit look like it straight out of 1997 httpwwwbillybobthorntonnet the premis of true detect is a great exampl of this  serious  fuck cinema but then there show like 2 broke girl the big bang theori and other crappi sitcom his head kinda look like it doesnt belong on that bodi tv is a writer medium  film is a director medium guy cheat on angelina joli he know how to look for better altern cabl tv sure i would agre with this  but the local channel and stuff you get without cabl and onli with tv rabbit ear eh not so much  the basic channel cbs abc and such are still too pg rate for me i think true detect attest to this that antholog format will allow for incred possibl yes becaus you dont have to take step to make sure your tv show can be success in china you can just make your show this is the next big opportun for the movi theater industri whi not start show hbo netflix show on the big screen for a super reduc ticket cost ive read that lincoln the daniel day lewi one was thisclos to be a shortshot seri on hbo ie televis and look at the award it won as a movi   edit sourcehttpinsidemoviesewcom20130613lincolnspielberghbo  gtand yesterday two major influenti voic indic that they may be join the protv chorus georg luca and steven spielberg  gtthe director had team up for a chat about the state of the film industri at the univers of southern california the school is luca alma mater spielberg appli but didnt get in neither seem to think that state is particular strong enorm market cost and increas studio pressur have made it more and more difficult to creat and releas ani film that dont seem like shooin blockbust the pathway to get into theater is realli get smaller and smaller luca said accord to the hollywood report  gtthe star war creator also call cabl tv much more adventur than film today ad that he believ the lincoln will eventu disappear from theater and appear onli on tv  as mine almost was spielberg said interrupt it was this close  ask hbo  this close  movi that i love and thought in their day were incred origin and entertain were thing like the demon seed rosemari babi to sir with love guess whos come to dinner the origin jaw the godfath alien shit too mani to put here in one post  but you just dont see too mani origin type movi anymor  although i thought avatar was veri good and veri origin for a stori  i love a lot of the old movi from the earli 70s what is he talk about  can you make a shakycam tv show  not typic  can you remak a show from as littl as 8 year ago  hell no youd be call pathet  can you make movi plot 19 with the monster attack locat and hero destroy import antagonist infrastructur with a 100 million dollar special effect budget  nope  televis is total limit to use plot and stori element to keep peopl interest  total restrict i swear ive seen bigger point across in half hour show than in 2 hour film canadian audienc are like mash potato without gravi eh billi bob go f your self  take a look at that pictur again angelina joli use to fuck him regular brad pitt and that guy are in some respect on the same level   the world is one wild and fuck up place  the wire is the best exampl of this break bad soprano and game of throne support this argument as well who care hes a first class prick  httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvijws6qyy7bw yeah becaus the pinnacl of sophist is the bullshit they air on mtv or tlc  liter anyth is less braindead than hollywood now im get ahead of the curv here radio is where today modern artist can realli let er rip some tv 999 of what peopl watch is pure shite say the guy who hasnt made a film worth see in year hasnt this alway been the case though while some movi do great thing with charact develop they are restrict by time tv has the time to craft good and more realist develop the differ is that it seem that the stigma that tv is pretti much a film star grave is go away so we are get more and more bigger name actor join the field also as time has gone by it seem like showrunn are plan out the entir seri so they end the charact stori befor a charact can becom tiresom whenev i think of billi bob i think of that one

ask either  1 question that show theyv research the compani this show me that they put some work in up front 2 question about my compani cultur this show me that they want to fit in and might not see the job as just a job we spend so much of our live at work i like it when peopl want to be sure theyll be happi here 3 question about what project are come in the pipelin this show that theyr eager to get start i did a round of interview last week the best candid when prompt for ani question he may have had at the end gave us a sort of brief rundown of the posit and what he thought hed be do and he ask us if that was accur and if we could fill in ani blank  i realli like that it show he research the posit well and was a nice express of interest  one of my favorit is whi is the posit open  their respons to this can tell you a lot about the job andor compani if the last person was fire they wont tell you that direct of cours but usual itll be becaus the person occupi it befor got a promot move to someth that interest himher more or someth els mutual amic like that and that can at least get a convers start on an employe potenti for intern promot movement and thing like that depend on when this is ask it can also provid a much less awkward altern to that dread where do you see yourself in five year question sinc know more about how thing work in the compani can give you more of a feel for what would be realist for yourself if you were to take the posit well first and foremost you should ask question dure that part  if you dont it make it look as though your look for a job as oppos to look for the right job  this in turn make you look desper and as if you dont realli care about the compani in question  ask about who youll be work with on a daili basi  ask about what the daili expect of the job are  ask about advanc opportun within the compani  realli sit down and think about if this job were offer to you right now what would you have to know about it befor you agre to start it  except you probabl shouldnt ask what the pay like but that one of few except  if i were to start in this posit right away what is the singl biggest contribut i could make in the first few week   do you like work for this compani   how long have you work for this compani   how big would my team be   what is the averag age of my team   how long has the team been togeth   how much time on averag would you say the team spend in meet per week   what would a person in my posit averag day look like   what is the turnov rate here   do employe general get along well   do they social with each other after work sometim   if you had to pick would you say the compani lean more googl or more ibm when it came to work environ   how often would i be ask to work more than 40 hour per week or work on weekend   is there ani reason you think i might have difficulti do this job at the level the compani want   id like the opportun to address ani hesit you have about my abil to do the job are there ani youd like to share at this time   whi is this posit avail   what are some of you and your collegu hobbi outsid of work   what are some of the less desir characterist of this posit   how did you start work here  and final   what was it about my applic that interest you enough to invit me to interview  cobbl togeth from various thread on employmenthir that ive been read through recent ive given mani interview and person speak i feel a candid should be ask the question they want to ask for me the grade part of the interview is over when im done ask so it now an open session and up to them to decid if they would like to follow anyth up ask for clarif or anyth they genuin want to know im not go to dock them becaus they didnt ask me someth i like it when they do but i dont penal them if they dont peopl are differ some ask question some dont ive hire peopl on both end of it one question i took from reddit is  what is the greatest thing about work here   it throw them off their script if you want to go for the more cocki you can say  whi do i want to work here   which doesnt fit my person compar to the first one i alway ask a lot of question alway i write them down befor hand and i leav them in my clipboard along with 2 extra copi of my resum a copi of the job descript and a few sheet of blank paper  when they say do you have ani question my respons is yes i actual wrote down quit a few while i was prepar for the interview open clipboard scan list of question ive written down some of which weve alreadi cover throughout the interview like a b and c but i still have a coupl more this show i came prepar and am take this interview serious when i say this it often appear to come as a pleasant surpris to the interview and i see them perk up   rememb these interview often have done dozen of interview the last month they get in a groov ask their set question and make note then on the the next one now theyr think yes i can final just talk with someon instead of follow this formula interview templat this part of the interview can take a more casual tone and is visibl more enjoy for both you and the interview so take advantag  so on to the core of your question what question should i prepar obvious the answer is it depend but it depend on you   what are your legitim concern with the job descript ask them to elabor on someth from the descript that you are interest concern about or you dont fulli understand if theyr respons isnt clear repeat how you understood it and ask if that was correct ask simpl follow up question oh do you guy deal with this comput system that vendor this type of equip oh cool i use someth similar when i work at x job a few year ago  one of my go to question is if i were to get this job is there anyth you would recommend i doreadlearn beforehand in order for me to be more prepar on day one   anoth is how do you go about train new employe will i have access to the person who i am replac mayb theve been promot is this a new posit theyr expand and you can learn from other who do the same job or is this a brand new role a job descript that has never been implement at the compani befor  ani question involv career advanc are most like welcom as long as they are done in a gentl tone dont give the impress your just look to climb the ladder and make big buck without put in the work need to earn it  avoid question about compens vacat etc unless it is direct brought up by the interview  ive been on a number of interview and my success rate is fair high but i think the big thing for me is that at this point in my career i go in know that i dont need this job  they have to sell me on the posit just as much as i have to sell them on me obvious for mani peopl who are current out of work new to the workforc or hate their current job this may not be the case it may be hard but tri to fake it until you make it    where was this post 3 hour ago  just attend an interview couldnt think of anyth felt like a moron ask what the typic day in the role is like what would the duti of the role be if not discuss what duti the interview undertak if relev  it your chanc to interview them see if you like the job there was a great post last year about what question to ask at the end of an interview some of the good one were   if i were to step into this role tomorrow what would be my top prioriti   what are some charact trait that you feel are import to succeed in this role   what chang would you like to see from the next person to fill this role   is there ani reason you can think of that i wouldnt be a good fit for this posit this one is a bit ballsi but it could give you a veri good indic of your chanc   do you like work here this question is less about the answer and more about how they answer it one of the top answer you should be look for is the peopl establish an idea of the corpor cultur is veri import  good luck op my father ran a small law firm for about 30 year he use to love it when prospect employe ask if they could go on a tour of the offic it broke down the formal of the interview situat allow them to interact in a more normal way rememb a larg part of interview is about the employ decid whether they can actual put up with workinginteract with you day in day out i alway close after all the other question about the job by ask  are there ani reserv you have about my fit for the posit that i can address for you befor we finish the interview  if they are be truth it put the interview in a posit to tell you where they see your fault and allow you to address how you will resolv those issu i dont have a litmus test but there are a few dont   dont have noth to say at this point it suggest to me you werent listen if there isnt a singl thing you want to know about  dont ask what the compani doe or what the job respons are i alreadi told you that again you should have been listen  basic a few good question about almost anyth will tell me you were pay attent that tell me you want the job  if you want to go over salarybenefit again or if you want some detail that werent obvious or if you say i need to clarifi or even refresh my memori as you ask your question you can pretti much ask anyth you want protip refresh my memori is a get out of jail free card for question it okay to forget stuff at least you rememb that i said the answer at some point the one time i ask so when do i start i got the job do you have ani concern about how i might fit this role that i can address  it show your confid enough to ask not scare to be challeng  and it give you a chanc to address anyth that might have held you back from get the job   edit is there anyth that we have talk about that you would like me to clarifi or elabor on is a good one if you feel you cant say the word concern without look like you expect some my favorit from a similar thread month agohttpwwwredditcomraskredditcomments1cxpq8what_are_the_dos_and_donts_of_a_job_interview   do you have ani doubt regard my abil to fill this role  it forc them to acknowledg your shortcom if your in a job interview it like isnt the onli job youv appli for and your like to have other after it this forc the interview to be veri frank about your qualif and can point out area that you might not have realiz your lack in it allow you to both address these reserv they might have on the spot mayb you forgot to list a technic qualif on your resum and it didnt come up in the interview but also in futur interviewsjob applic you can activ address this weak   what do your best employe say about work here  this one forc them to cut through the bullshit they probabl arent expect it and will give you a pretti honest respons this one work better when the question is pose to your potenti boss you can probabl gaug hisher connect with hisher employe doe he fulli understandappreci their concern or do you get a generic can respons mean hesh probabl is distant from his employe and perhap not a good manag i probabl interview about 100 peopl last year for itrel job so ive been on the other side of this question quit a bit  the best interview are about twoway communic where the interview amp interviewe are both tri to figur out if this is a good match  if someon ask noth here that indic to me that they dont realli care where they work  the interview has just spent a lot of time figur out if you can do they job theyr tri to fill  this is your opportun to make sure that this employ will be a good fit for you  your go to be spend 40week with them so you want to make sure it will be a good place to work  if this is a careerbuild job rather than a parttim job while your studi then you need to make damn sure that your go to the right place  if it hasnt come out alreadi in the interview then you should ask question like  1  what kind of career path could i expect to see at abc compani  followup with specif question about your roleskillset 2  how would you describ the cultur at abc compani  followup with detail question base on what the interview say 3  how doe abc compani do career plan and perform review  if appropri ask about how top perform are reward or if there are opportun for bonus depend on the industri amp job type 4  what opportun for advanc are there at abc compani 5  anyth specif about your person situat  for exampl on the 3rd tuesday of everi month i need to leav 15 min earli to pick up my kid will that be a problem 6  what would a typic work day look like for someon in my posit  imho this is probabl the most import question to ask  follow up with specif question or clarif  if they want you to do someth that you dont like or cant do eg travel introvert make sale call all the time extrovert work alon most of the time then let them know then amp there that that will be a challeng and discuss how you could make it work  you need to know that the daytoday activ of your job will be someth you want to spend your time do  you get the idea  if at the end of all of this you want the job then let them know that you think it a good fit here are some of the stuff i almost alway ask im a programm  1 could you describ the cultur are these peopl look to get in and out asap and go to famili everi day or is it a place peopl come to to build cool thing  2 what kind of environ do you run im look for whether or not theyr a forwardthink shop or stuck in the past  3 whi are you hire for this job have you fire someon recent or is it growth what role do you envis the person in this job perform  4 who are your competitor and who are your custom how are you innov the beat out your competitor and win the custom everyon should rememb that interview should be a twoway process dont go in to it with onli the intent of land the job you may not want to i actual have a coupl point on my resum that i use as flag to determin if i dont want to work somewher  unlik the interview the interviewe is put hisher life up for ant in an interview for the interview this is part of the job theyr get paid for the interviewe your spend your precious free time the interview alreadi has a grasp of the compani and environ while the interviewe is walk in somewhat blindfold usual   if this is a serious job search it warrant serious consider you dont just take the first thing that fall in your lap unless it exact what you set out for if this is a job you want to be at for the next 20 year consid what kind of place you want to be in for 8 hour a day 5 day a week for the next 20 year   i just recent got a new posit that i absolut love it came on the heel of be laid off from my previous job with an ok sever packag i basic had a month paid vacat in which to dedic my time exclus to job hunt i set out to land my dream job what i have isnt that by a long shot but it the closest im go to get at my experi level    gaug how the compani recruit talk to you and address you whether it contracttohir through an agenc or directhir pay attent to the general atmospher when you enter the officework area invari you should be shown it at some point   here are some good question i like to ask and the explan for whi it a good question to ask  if i were to accept your offer when is the earliest i would be abl to start  this flip the when can you start question over becaus they usual dont come back with that until the offer letter if you have a month of sever wait 2 month to start isnt go to work   what kind of turnaround do you see in this posit  this will reveal not onli how long they expect to have you but also how long it took befor your predecessor left  is this a new posit if yes that usual good if no follow up with what happen to open it up this is an invers of the question whi are you look for a new job  this probe to find out whether the person youll be replac was fire quit or promot if they were fire or quit you may not want to jump right in to whatev mess they left behind if they were bad or work under the peopl who drove them to leav it may indic a hostil environ or irrespons fingerpoint paper tiger  this next one is my silver bullet my million dollar question ive debat on share it and i will it damn good natur put it in your own word my phrase is just how i talk  let say you offer me the posit and i accept a year from now your give me my first annual perform review and ive just blown away your expect you think hire me was one of the best hire you ever made and your realli impress with my work what are the top three thing i would have done to make that impress this one hing on some sale techniqu in the mode of posit reinforc keep them say yes make them imagin themselv with the product enjoy the product you are the product sell yourself if you want this job this first make them pictur you in role it then subt pin down the expect of at least a year of employ and then it move them to think of you do thing that impress them it also help show what their prioriti are  one of the flag i use in my resum is the word ethic in my object statement that be brought up can be either good or bad and it all in how it brought up you might not have the same compunct i do about what the product of your labor result in so this particular exampl might not be for you but the idea still stand i had one interview ask an ethic compani what doe that even mean  at that point i knew that wasnt a place i want to work convers the place i did accept the offer from mention it as well in their initi communic to me the recruit found my resum and said i saw your a net develop and i thought it was realli interest that your look for an ethic compani he then went on to explain the princip that the compani was found on that was awesom and i love where i work i love my job the atmospher in the offic is friend and amaz the peopl i work with are support and account i may not be do exact what i alway want to but i sure as hell am do it exact where i want to ill be happi if i work for this compani for the rest of my life but i didnt get it by jump on the first offer i got or settl for a toxic environ  my best wish to all of you out job hunt i hope you land the perfect job what is your favorit thing about work here direct the focus onto them help and this question help you realli decid if the job is go to be the right fit if your interviewermanag dont like what they are do they are probabl go to be miser  can you walk me through a typic day here easiest way to see if you would be okay with work there sure some job are total differ each day but there is still an averag day with task you do everyday  what would be the next step after this interview this one is how i got the job i am in now just ask what happen next and see if there is anyth i need to do realli make an impress that you are proactiv with your employ if you dont care to know how soon we will be call i will be less like to call back some job requir back ground check to be done befor hire so know what step are go to be taken will help out immens  back in the day when i appli to work as a landscap the interview ask if i had ani question and i ask when do i get to get my hand dirti and he smile and said tomorrow and he hire me  ask question that show your enthusiast  it how i hire my sex slave now ask question as you go along through the interview  ive alway found that when im interview someon theyr also interview me    i hate get to the end of an interview to have someon either 1 ask no question and use the excus youv cover off everyth i had or 2 ask a ton of question that tie into earlier question ive ask them  interview should be like a free flow convers in my eye  appreci some interview may be technic or practic and you dont get a chanc  but for other that are compet base ensur your ask the right question at the right time    at the end of the interview ask some relax question like are there ani social group within the compani  what do peopl do to unwind   some i have gather from reddit and some from other site i use the first two for the current job that i am at    what would i be task with in my first 30 6090 day if offer a job here   what are your goal for the compani in the next year   what do you realli enjoy about work here   what skill do i need to have most to help the team   if i were hire what would you like to see me achiev in my first three to six month on the job   whi is this posit vacant   do you have ani reserv in hire me   what are the biggest challeng the person in this posit will face   how would you describ your manag style   think back to the person who youv seen do this job best what made their perform so outstand   whi is this posit avail   what are some of you and your collegu hobbi outsid of work   what are some of the less desir characterist of this posit   how did you start work here   take note over question answer dure the interview and at the end if you review your list and say interest i think we cover everyth i was look to know ill be more impress   ask if the posit your interview for is a new one or would you be replac someon  what was the prior worker best at    ask about the interview team  what is it like to work in the team  do they work independ or togeth    is work assign accord to specialti or spread out base on who is avail the idea is to find out about crosstrainingskil develop then listen   what was it about my applic that interest you enough to invit me to interview   ask interview if hesh like their job   if i were to step into this role tomorrow what would be my first prioriti   what improv do you want the new hire to bring to the role   do you like work here   do you think id be a good fit for this role   do you see ani reason whi i wouldnt be a good fit for this role ask where you will be work which deskmachin and who you will be work with  this make the interview form a mental pictur of you in the work place this is appar a good way to forc a posit associ in an interview  eg the interview pictur doctorstrang sit in the middl cubicl between luci and rauel   i cant rememb where i came across this tip  it may have origin come from a redditor i usual ask what a normal typic day would be like as an employe and mayb perhap if they like it at the compani mayb not the answer your look for but i onli ask someon in for an interview if their résumé meet or is close enough to what im look for  so my interview style is just to have a convers with the person becaus at this point im just tri to make sure they are who their résumé say they are and get a sens of their person  and i can determin this typic within the first coupl of minut  i think those trick question are a realli lame and lazi way of interview  as far as follow up question  im more than happi to answer anyth and everyth but certain dont care if you ask anyth one way or the other  i love find peopl who are energet and have a genuin passion for their career  those are tomorrow star in my industri not current an employ ran a cell phone retail store for sever year though  the biggest thing i look for was some kind of impress that the person i was interview had sat down and imagin themselv in the role i was hire for   i had one young ladi ask me what my favourit colour was when i got to the do you have ani question for me part she end up get the posit but dure the interview her respons were veri open end thought out and encourag good convers and she had brought up most of her concern dure that period  end up be a veri good employe and eventu took over my posit when i move on i actual have a job interview tomorrow morn so this thread could not come at a better time thank you will updat on the situat each job is differ and for each of my job over the past few year i wish id ask certain question dure the interview process these question would have shone light on issu within the compani that i wish id known in advanc   what would you consid this team biggest success in the past year  what 3 qualiti would your ideal candid possess  what made you decid to pivot to a new custom base asid from the fact that it trendi have you done ani research with your exist custom to see how they will react to the chang  what is your favorit part about your job  can you give me an exampl of an idea a lower level employe had which was put into action  how approach is the ceo doe he accept suggest from everyon in the compani  person im constant seek a work environ of creativ respect ambit and drive toward a common goal some of the question abov are pretti specif and some are general but they would have let me know that one compani had an unclear valu proposit therefor unclear compani direct overal one compani was so tight manag by the ceo that no one els idea ever got approv and one compani was fill with employe who were creativ but had zero invest in the compani overal mission  my ideal compani to work for isnt necessarili the same as your so your question will be differ but that should be your goal in the interview to see how close this workplac match your ideal i was just hire at a compani after a barrag of phone interview with vp level staff i use a bunch of differ question with each one about the compani and the cultur and by the time i got to the last guy i had noth els to ask that i didnt alreadi know the answer to     when that inevit moment came to ask question i drew a blank for what felt like an etern in my head apolog that id alreadi gotten so mani of my question answer alreadi then i somehow came up with ask him what project hed work on in his 10 year at the compani was the one he consid the most fun and enjoy    he was complet caught off guard by this and then spent a good 10 minut reflect on a few thing hes done that he realli enjoy you know how you can hear someon smile when you talk to them on the phone this guy was definit like the fact that he was get to talk about himself for onc so i ask followup question base on his stori total stroke his ego while actual learn about how a vp at the compani interact with his staff and client in the process which was an unintend bonus  when i met him in person after that he told me straight up that hed been so impress by that question that as soon as wed hung up he call the hire manag and told him that our guy    tldr take an interest not onli in the job but also in the peopl ask the question peopl with ego definit appreci get to talk about themselv i have five question i use regular  1 whi has this posit becom avail  2 what is the biggesthardest hurdlechalleng for someon come into this posit  3 what is the offic cultur  work atmospher like relax structur etc are there offic cubicl how is inform convey by manag to the employe  email public memoboard etc  4 how doe a typic workday play out here id like to know what the schedul  rhythm is like  5 do you have ani linger concern about recommend me for this posit       all veri import question but lemm tri to explain the logic behind them  1  this is great if you can follow up the question with some of the research youv done about the compani recent histori re growth new project etc if the answer to the question is anyth other than the last guy quitwa fire then you can illustr how your skill and experi address the new develop  2 3 4  forethought alway alway alway demonstr forethought of the three i would say 2 is the most import as it demonstr you arent plan to swan in like god gift to the industri  your expect challeng and want to address them befor they even have a chanc to becom an issu  5  everyon i know seem terrifi of this question becaus they dont want to show weak or timid eff that nois if your interview is weak then your do yourself no favor by let the hire manag dwell on those weak  my friend wrote what to ask dure your interview to reveal more about your bosshttpblogbrazencareeristcom20130924whattoaskduringyourinterviewtorevealmoreaboutyourboss  she suggest these five question to learn more about your potenti boss paraphras from the brazen careerist blog  1 how and when do you give feedback to employe  2 what are the other team member like  3 what qualiti make peopl on your team success  4 how often do you interact with the peopl who work for you  5 whi did you join this compani and what kept you here  the answer to these question are reveal  im late to this game and i doubt few will see this 3621st comment  anyth and everyth  this is an incred import point in the process  you can find great answer to this anywher on the internet there are lot of stori of peopl who felt they had no chanc yet end up get the job becaus they more or less turn the interview around  ask what the interview doe for the compani when hes not interview same if there are more peopl present  ask where the interview think the compani will be in five year  ask how their product or servic differenti itself in the field  ask about potenti bonus structur and promot  rais schedul  ask what youll like do on your first day on the job in the first week  tri and get specif about what they will expect from you onc you are settl in  ask about the person histori of the compani and it founder  ask if they have will have a problem if you show up half an hour earli everi day  ask about the last person who was fire and what they did wrong  ask about the last person who was promot and what they did right  ask whi the compani hasnt branch out into other field  market  ask about insur and retir polici  ask what the ceo might say if he were in the room  ask about compani parti  with everi question you are show more interest and prove that you are invest even at that stage  obvious you want to gear your question appropri dont ask what your interview favorit color is and yes you will run out of good question after a while but it is so much better to get to that point and mayb even feel a littl awkward than for you to walk out have ask littl or noth  drop your inhibit and be interest in the detail you need to ask the follow  1  what will my first 90 day look like  what will you expect for me to accomplish in those first 90 day  2 what opportun for profession develop doe this compani provid their employe  3 what opportunit doe this compani have for advanc and what expect can i have with regard to advanc  4 how long have you been employ here and what do you like about work here  5 what area of improv doe your compani have that the leadership is current addressingwork on  6 someon els alreadi said this but i agre  if you are interview with the person you will be work for ask to speak with a coupl of their employe  this is a good thing to do becaus it show you are select in where you work  peopl who take their career serious and are select in where they work they dont just take ani job to pay the bill are almost alway high perform  if they let you speak with a coupl of their employe which they almost alway will  if they dont that should be a red flag for you and you might not want to work there ask similar question  what do they like about work at the compani what is mrms manag like to work for what kind of profession develop do they offer etc  dont ask about pay  it is consid unprofession  they have probabl alreadi ask you what salari you are look for and if it is the rang of what they pay hr has pass you along to the hire manag  if your salari requir are too high you wont make it to the point of the hire manag there are except to this but general speak this is the case  sourc  i have work in hr for 15 year the singl best question to ask at the end of an interview what are the must have skillsqual for this posit  they will put what they want on a tee for you it give you a golden chanc to reiter whatev you discuss in the interview around those item and cover anyth that might have been miss i can tell you what question not to ask   1 how mani absenc are allow how much sick time do you have i understand ask about benefit but make an emphasi about time off tell me that your actual more interest about not work  2 how strict is the dress code your not even work here yet and your worri about wear bluejean  3 how do i get your job listen fucknut that funni haha but serious i have to hire you befor you can eas me out of my posit not so smooth  4 will you be my supervisor or will it be someon older or more male i have serious had peopl ask me these thing dont if you have issu take instruct from someon younger than you or a feeeemal pleas look for employ elsewher  5 what the polici on bring kid to work there isnt one becaus child labor is against the law and were not pay you to watch your kid while your here i understand women with children have issu with childcar from time to time but unless it explicit state that your kid are welcom to play in your cubicl then odd are they arent  6 have you call my refer well if i hadnt befor i will be do so now   im current a sahm but befor that i work in manag for 10 year i hate do interview so so much  regardless of the level or industri i think you should ask whatev you need to know to determin whether this is the job for you but i would suggest phrase your question in such a way that it show youv alreadi done some of the legwork   i work in healthcar where panel of multipl interview are requir so the best answer you can give when we ask if you have question is to say that youv alreadi had your question answer when you phonedemail the contract person on the ad we are more than happi to answer question specif to you or are somewhat uniqu but if you ask will you have to work night or what subspecialti are avail or anyth that is found in our websit we know youv done no research on your own and that will most definit count against you  you should actual make me say have you ani more question  my onli real advic for interviewe is to ask lot of question throughout the interview and to do plenti of research in advanc  whi let me count the way  1 i think curios is a life skill be curious   2 it general a good idea to get peopl to talk about themselv the thing that interest them their expertis it put peopl at eas that mean the interview   3 it show that youv done your homework the type of question ask can be veri reveal as someon who has actual interview peopl i dont care what peopl ask if the person want to know if theyll get free soda or if theyll get to leav earlier on friday afternoon it up to them differ thing are import to differ peopl i dont judg them base upon what they find import i judg them base on whether theyll be a good employe and a good fit  if your look for someth that will give you an advantag ask question that make it look like your interest and concern match those of the compani even then i dont realli consid the free for all question part of the interview unless the person ask about watch porn in the offic or someth  edit work in tech sinc a happi work environ will keep you at the job ask about corpor cultur and turnov rate while your be interview take note sometim theyll just bullet question at you what is your greatest strength but sometim theyll do leadin like our client are in a tough situat and often lash out how do you deal with conflict resolut  scribbl a littl note of that when it come time for you to ask question look at your note and think of someth to ask deeper essenti they just gave you a littl hint about the job that wasnt advertis and thus you wouldnt have known befor hand so that your hook to dig in deeper  you mention that sometim the client will lash out though i am good with conflict resolut on my own we both know that some peopl just dont want the conflict to be resolv im curious  what procedur doe this firm have for that sort of situat  the question doesnt matter near as much as prove you were listen and show curios and eager an interest question that may shed a lot of light on what your about to do would i be abl to talk to someon in a posit similar to mine one question that i like to ask is whi is this posit open usual can tell you a lot on whether you want to be there the one thing ive heard and love was what keep you at x compani  made me think about the compani and how to convey that in a posit light although it most is the last time this question came up one of the top post was to say how will i be abl to immedi contribut to your officeworkplacelabbusi  it show a control eager and a seem desir to actual help out at the busi and certain make it look like you arent just do it for the paycheck after be hire i got compliment for have good question in my job interview i just ask thing that i was genuin curious about  what would a typic day look like for me in this posit am i replac someon and whi did they leav  what opportun for advanc are there with this role what would you consid success and excel in this role i think i phrase it better but i want to know what thing i could do that would be consid abov and beyond what is the compani cultur here would i be main solo or in a team and if team what sort of team would i be in  it help that this was at a veri small compani so they knew exact what was happen in that role and the offic to answer my question and judg these question dont just ask them becaus you have to if they say youll be work in a larg group with lot of meet and group think time when you realli want to fli solo mayb reconsid the posit  if you can think of an allstar insert posit here what make them so good  ive nail two competit job use this question one interview said it was the best question anyon has ask i like to ask what is the best thingproject you did while work for this compani hey im not an employ and i know this comment will get buri  but this list was veri help for me when i appli at lifetim fit  httpiimgurcomw9bzrrjjpg 1 anyth your curious about that we didnt discuss  anyth 2 compens question shouldnt be ask as if theyr the most import but let face it  we work for money so i expect them you should ask them your here to be compens for work that you do your time is valuabl if you dont think your time has valu i dont want you work for me 3 if your not sure what to ask becaus your overwhelm it okay to ask if you can email me if you have question later it okay to tell me that weve cover a lot can i absorb it and follow up in email 4 challeng me if there someth we discuss that not clear  give me an exampl to clarifi the question 5 a veri import question to ask  that show you have some intellectu curios about the organ is whi has this posit becom avail it go to be becaus of growth becaus someon got can or quit when you get the answer ask whi and how were grow whi the other person quit or whi they were let go the answer will give you a lot of insight into the organ it will also ecourag me to go deeper into the interwork of my group  and it show that your matur enough to understand that job dont sprout from the ground 6 give me some indic that youv research the compani if our web site say we have 900 employe and 1800 custom  find someth to ask like how that ratio has chang over the last 5 year etc  whi is this posit open what doe a typic day in this role look like what is expect in this posit within the first 30 day do you enjoy work here tell me about some of the peopl ill be work with direct  sourc im a hr profession been hire for 20 year here   the singl best question anybodi ever ask me was what doe a person be success in this job look like to you i was wonder as a side note is it okay will not negat hurt your chanc for candid to state that they have no question when they realli dont have ani question  especi in multiround interview where there are sever recruit come in i find it hard tri to muster up a uniqu question for each recruit  also what question should we not be ask in interview in hr and some question could blow back on you i have had great interview then i chang my mind about them dure the question some peopl ask question that on paper may sound good but in person make them sound like a douch  as in interview my favorit answer to this question is no i found what i want on your websit and it is random thing becaus it show you actual look into what you were appli for it irk me if they ask thing about the posit that have been over on the websit if there was no way to research it and you dont have ani question the follow up your no with we went over such and such in the interview alreadi show that you listen   i get a lot of question about the health benefit though which im ok to answer that is one of the few i would ask if it wasnt gone over in the interview question about how much overtim there is and how often it come up which i dont mind either  do not ask how mani of day of work that you can miss i have been ask that more than onc sad this wasnt even entri level but a posit that start around 60k a year and the guy had a colleg degre   it depend on your interview and probabl their sex i think women tend to talk more i work with 3 ladi and their interview are almost twice as long as mine and they probabl enjoy question i dont i give a quick run down of what they will be do in their posit i skip the bullshit question that they can make up answer to like what was a time that you were challeng and all that stuff even though we were train to do it i made up the answer to almost all mine when get hire and sure mani other have also   also do not ask a bunch of question dure the part where i am ask you question unless it pertain to the question that i just ask you that piss me off and throw me off track i give like 6 of these in a row or more and have a routin mani of the question that are be ask will be answer as i go along and you will just throw me off and irrit me the best question ive ever had an interviewe ask if you hire me what do i need to do over the next 12 month to make you say hire ltltinsert your name heregtgt was the best decis we made this year show that he didnt just want to join the team he want to domin we hire him it was the best decis of the year  more general i would just demonstr an interest in the companyani specif are good so mani applic just mass appli to thing they dont take time to research or learn about each compani just one refer to languag on our websit make a big differ here are some of the question that got me the job ive had   1 how mani other are appli for this posit this let you test the water for your competit  2 is there ani reason you can think of that i wouldnt get this posit this let you overcom ani concern they might have right there in the moment and leav a posit impress when you do overcom said concern but be prepar to give a solid counter argument to their issu if they have one  this can open up a can of worm if you didnt present yourself well in the interview  3 so when can i start be flexibl with your word on this depend on how you and the interview get along  you dont want to seem arrog just confid  but it is so import to actual ask for the job i interview new employe often and it amaz how few peopl take this step  4 what the next step or when will i hear from you show you take initi and want to know the next step  also here is a list of question has help me stand out in mani interview so i high recommend it even if it is a littl old httpwwwgijobscompowerquestionsyoushouldaskaspx what is the differ between do good and great work in this posit   show interest to the employ  make employ paus and identifi the key tasksrespons beyond the hr filler  help zero in on the expect for the interviewe becaus the question part is for you not the employ   other note  if you have no question it show apathi  you should have question if you care about get the job if you dont you will not be there long think about the thing youv care about or had interest in  you alway ask question about them and this if your job 23 of your typic week so you should care  exampl while not an earth shatter question what is the next step in this process tell me you give a damn to ask and want to know what next  interest ive interview a lot of peopl the one question that stuck in my head and is the question i alway ask is  if you offer me the posit whi should i choos to come and work here  i think it show confid that you have option and it make employ think about what the good bot of their compani are post to find this post later kind disregard one question that has serv me veri well for a long time is can you list the top 3 thing you would like to chang about the compani  initi i just want to as someth differ but when i began hire my own peopl i realis that this sort of question is good for a number of reason   it is unexpect and make you stand out in their memori   it subconsci creat a sens that you are interest in their person opinion and valid them and everyon seek to retain peopl that valid them   you will actual get some honest answer about what might suck at the compani becaus ask what they would chang is depend on what they dont like but ask that direct will usual lead to generic nonsens   by the time i reach that question the decis has alreadi been made if a hire manag is use that question to judg a candid interest in a posit or compani then they did not do a good job of find that out dure the interview i am look for the best person for the job not the best interview for the job be in it i alreadi know that statist the best person for the job is like to be an introvert like me if i can make the person less nervous and get at what they know rather than how they react to question then the better i can ass the best candid for the job i like when someon ask a question show they e done some research about the compani too mani peopl come in for an interview know noth about the compani  i alway ask whi do you want to work here and i normal just get stutter  i have had peopl ask me about specif item off our websit about plan expans or even differ product or servic and it tell me that they care enough about the posit to do a littl research as oppos to just look for ani paycheck they can get  alway know someth about the compani befor an interview especi abov all when the compani was foundedopen some of my counter part alway ask that question in an interview  my 2 cent i work in hr i alway ask do you have ani question befor wrap up an interview  one excel question that was ask by a candid that i and the hire manag were interview was do you have ani reserv about my qualif or background that i can address with you now  took us both by complet surpris but it also gave everyon a chanc to open discuss ani doubtsquest candid dude got the job and has been an excel employe i usual ask them if theyr happi work there  not becaus i want to look good but becaus in my limit experi most peopl answer honest  they wont bullshit and just tell you the truth   attent pleas keep in mind that the op of this thread has chosen to mark this post with the serious repli onli tag therefor ani repli that are joke pun

cant realli say how much this affect my success as in i was hire interview i have two goto question the first is the describ a typic day for this posit one that a lot of peopl are mention alreadi  the other one is someth i found somewher on the net if i want to get a run start at this job what do you think is the best way for me to prepar befor i start ani book i should read ani skill i should brush up on  tailor that one to the posit that your interview for and it both give you valuabl info and show that you carear enthusiast to the interview definit ask someth the worst thing to do is just say oh no i think you cover it all becaus i definit did not your probabl my seventh interview of the day and im tire i definit miss someth plus if i hit everyth the interview would be 2 hour long  that be said a person pet peev of mine is to come in with one of the can interview question i know what googl is and i have type in what interview question to ask if you go straight down the list from aboutcom i know you werent realli pay attent and dont realli care about the compani you just care about get a job  anyth from visit the websit for 30 second is a huge plus just to show that you understand the basic of what the compani doe  a coupl realli good one i can rememb  i look at your websit have you ever consid put x where y is  what has been your greatest accomplish sinc start here  i see that your expand across the countri where is your next plan locat open  im the it manag for a start up retail chain best one i had was what made you want to work for the compani  it brilliant  total throw some interview and turn the tabl also make you look like you have valu i was on the panel when a candid said this and it impress me i was also abl to answer him too though which was nice  ps we gave him the job your last question should be  is there anyth els you need from me in order to confirm my candidaci for the job what do you like to see in a employe here are some person favorit   ask about specif product the compani produc  sometim a websit isnt all that descript and it nice to hear an employe take on it   ask if they like work there and whi  as much as the employ hold all the power so to speak it a fair question and make the interview think too   ask about compani structur  how mani employe what would advanc look like    ask what your road map would look like for the first 30 day 60 day 1st year etc   ask what the cultur is like  they are see if you would fit in it fair to consid that from your side too ask about the cultur ask about dailyweek routin ask about work area ask about budget avail if applic ask what the interview like and dislik about the workplac  someon els in the thread said grade is over when they ask for question my grade stop when the candid had left the build their question matter i want to know if theyr engag in the job hunt and if they care ask ani genuin question that you have about the work of the compani if you dont have these then ask question which allow the interview to visual you as part of the team for eg i ask about the team can you tell me about the peopl i will be work with if i were consid for the job   ask about thing like opportun for learn if the compani sponsor learn on your own free time if it sponsor certif etc i usual ask about pay rate holiday accrual penalti rate elig for overtim mandatori overtim  if applic that sort of thing obvious if it left out of the interview or job advertis if theyv alreadi told you you look like an idiot ask again what kind of train opportun will i have show me your eager to learn and will probabl stick around for a while likewis what is the advanc track like here   if all your practic question have been answer ask about compani cultur there realli no bad question to ask but i wouldnt barrel right in with paybenefit question especi on a first interview there will be time to work that stuff out  doesnt that depend on the job you are appli for  doesnt matter do a littler research on the compani and ask a question that can be answer i hear your develop x doe your depart particip just show that you give a shit and that you are curious and did your homework if the interview is talk your do well  as a hire manag what im interest in is your critic think and problem solv abil more than almost anyth els this is an interest test if you genuin dont have ani curios about what life will be like work with us i probabl dont want to hire you the interview is for answer one question do i like this person at this point you know the candid qualif so you are look to see if this person is a good fir all the interact is just fodder  late at least in the healthcar field you go through a phone interview and then a face to face a recruit perform the phone interview and that your opportun to ask about salari    when face to face you should ask question like what attribut doe a person in this posit need to possess  you can expound on your own qualiti when they give an answer  what are your concern with my abil to be abl to perform this job ask opinion question peopl love to share their opinion what the most difficult aspect of the job or work for the compani what the corpor cultur like etc ask question relat to the work duti or the industri   it help to solidifi your sincer and show you are interest in the job which is a good plus for the employ   dont ask dumb question ask smart one   also ask what is expect from you within the next few month probat period and what the companysdepart longterm goal are project current be work on etc  if you can find out how long the last person was there for and get an idea of whi they left get a feel for if peopl stay for a while or the compani is a giant meat grinder  if your in it demand to see what their current setup look like you may be walk into a minefield with 10 year old server held togeth with duct tape and a hope and a prayer with no money to fix it you dont want to be there when the place blow up anyth that show youv research the compani and posit and anyth els you have question on serious ask us question dont clam up becaus you think you wont get the job know what your get yourself in to it is better for everyon  here someth they dont realli teach you in school  a job interview is a twoway thing your go to be work in this place for 8 hour a day 5 day a week possibl for mani year there a good chanc youll spend more time in term of number of hour with these peopl than you do with your spous  you absolut need to know that youd fit in and get along which mean you need to ensur the place offer what your look for  whether that career advanc a good worklif balanc or know youll be work with peopl who arent complet muppet  if your not tri to discern that id ask how serious you are about the job in the first place i alway ask the person interview me  what do you like about your jobcompani ask a question that show you have both research the compani and the develop of the role this show that you have initi and are think about the futur which is key most employ want someon who will grow within a compani   someth like  i notic that prestig worldwid work primarili with boat and hoe do you see yourself expand to bros as well and if so how would this affect the role i see most comment cover the import question to ask  but if by some horribl miracl these question were all alreadi cover in the interview you can alway ask this one last question how was your insert recent holiday  of cours dont make assumpt on their religion if it end of decemb just ask how was your holiday  after januari 1st how was your new year  etc the idea is to get them to keep talk  it extend the interview show you care about their live and that you are person  this is a question you would ask them if you were alreadi an employe  might as well get them use to feel like you are one of the crew  interview are as much about understand psycholog as they are a display of your qualif one of my favorit is is this a new posit      if the answer is no you should ask what happen to the employe that previous held the posit      it a question that will show your interest in get the right job not just a job and also is inform that would probabl be veri use anyway if the previous employe quit vs was promot an impress question to ask is  say i get hire what doe success look like to you in 6 month  it get the interview to realli think and show you care about how much impact youll be make  best question ive ever ask at an interview is what doe a win look like in this posit get the interview to reveal the detail of how the compani expect this role to provid valu to the organ i also ask over what time period after 6 month 12 month etc anoth way of ask the question is if this role hit a home run in the first 6 month how would that look how would it impact the compani in almost ani posit ive found this spark good convers and actual help me determin if the role is a good fit for me ive onli ever realli had interview in the it field for sysadmin job  for me the question are general gear toward what their network infrastructur is like what sort of uptim is expect what their typic annual budget is what their current backup system is like  those question both give me a great view on the compani general feel toward their it dept ie do they view it as a cost and keep them stuck with their hand tie due to no money or do they see it as a critic busi asset and grant the abil to spend money where necessari to do thing right as well as make me look veri interest and thorough i am on my compani interview committe and one realli good question back at us that stick in my mind was how do you measur success  it realli show that the candid was not onli interest in the job but in do it well  we hire her this is an honest question that you should ask them and i think it help you out is there ani reason you wouldnt hire me you might add some to it but it a legitim question that should get you a good respons theyll tell you what they like about you or some thing you could work on to help you in the futur interview realli are about feedback you might suck at some but if you get feedback from the interview be sure to use it to your advantag  i think it smart to learn about the compani beforehand and make a list of question that your truli interest in learn the answer to one that involv the posit your appli for and the compani as a whole you need to show interest in them make it look like you actual want the job i also never ask about pay in the first interview unless they bring it up so you should at least have an idea of what your look to be paid also i just want you to show some level of interest and engag in the whole process if youv been a dead fish up until the end use two word answer to my question et cetera then we are alreadi in a bad place nerv play a role in this sure but your someon im go to have to interact with on a regular basi i dont want talk to you to be a chore by itself  specif answer to op question i tend to talk a lot about the posit and the technic aspect of the job but there is more to work for a compani than that when it is your turn ask thing about the corpor cultur ask me what i enjoy most about the job what i enjoy least how long i work here and here i was befor ask for advic on how to excel ask what i expect from my report  see if you can draw ani parallel between my career path and your it will help me make a connect with you and rememb you the best interview i have we end up just shoot the shit favorit ski mountain our dog car troubl then i know you are easi to get along with in addit to qualifi you general want to ask question about what your daytoday work environ will be like it an opportun to find out whether if you were offer the job would you enjoy it and stay longterm or would you immedi start look for anoth job again   if you walk into an interview and the interview pull out your resum give it the thumb up and start to talk about trivial like what the food is like in the cafeteria you probabl want to look elsewher if you ask the interview which tool will i be use to get the job done or what kind of opportun will i have to develop my profession skill and becom a better employe and the respons is whichev tool you like or we dont realli help you learn more then you probabl want to look elsewher these kind of employ are look for peopl to work on stuff that they dont understand and thus couldnt possibl help establish realist expect for your output which more than anyth els will make your job a live hell either becaus you wont have enough work to do you will have too much work to do youll keep throw out work that is unsatisfactori becaus your boss didnt know what he actual want etc   these kind of question also help both you and your employ look more profession  you becaus you can ask followup question about the environ and thus show that you know what you will need to do to do your job best  and your employ by show that manag is compet which as most of us know is hard to find  hi there  ive interview no less than 100 peopl for a few separ job open in my life  first and foremost if this is an initi interview by the time we get to that last question we most like alreadi have our mind made up if you are a definit no or go into the mayb pile  so focus your energi on get to that next level first  im not particular look for you to give me a magic question to answer im look as to what kind of question your ask  question like when am i elig for vacat time and are these bonus are definit nono and im alway surpris how often these come out  to me they peg one as someon who is onli there for a paycheck and nudg their resum closer to the shredder    the best question ive ever been ask have been one that demonstr that they research this posit they are familiar with the compani or what their duti will be or show a vest interest in the qualiti of the posit  for a qualiti control posit i was ask exact what tool we had for them to use right down to brand name  it impress me with their knowledg and gave me the impress that they actual care about the job they would be task do  for a warehous posit were talk a 12hr job i was ask if the posit becam avail becaus of growth or turnov  this was someon who obvious been burn get a job that was quick termin befor and was make sure that this would be a stabl place to work while also find out if it was a terribl place to work  these are good qualiti question to ask  in general keep the question specif to the job you are appli for and moneyvac time benefit are off limit unless prompt  there will be a negoti phase of your interview  this is where those question go  a coupl of tip  dont ever ever let on about your famili  marit status especi if you have kid  a simpl wed band or not say enough if you choos to wear one  if your job will involv long or odd hour i guarante your hand will be look at  it illeg to not get employ over it in the us but it next to imposs to prove that it the reason you didnt get the job  employ cant ask you about this either but so mani peopl especi young mother readili volunt this inform  now i never use it against anybodi but so mani place do  think about it  all thing equal would you rather have someon work for you that has no famili and therefor would probabl be more will to put in longer hour or someon that you know will be take day off when their kid get sick and need to leav at 5 everi day so they can be home with them  and a person one for me  men  no cologn  women  no perfum  none  not even a smidgen  i imagin myself have to smell it everi day and more often than not it not a good prospect  but onc again  focus not on this part  focus your energi on the question they are ask  befor you go in  make sure your shoe are tie and your tie is tie  turn off your phone  let me say it again  turn it off  vibrat is as good as on and if you cant be without notif for the durat of a potenti life chang interview how can i trust you to focus on your job  better yet leav it in your car  if it a wait room type interview where you are wait with other candid your interview start when you tell the receptionist you are there and if you are play candi crush in the wait room it look wors than someon review their resum  research the posit as best you can and the compani befor you step foot insid the place  walk in with confid  shoulder up spine straight  shake everyon hand firm  these are small gestur but they count    good luck let say in a year im get an award for exemplari work what did i do what is the nicest thing someon here has done for you  my new favorit peopl are realli surpris by it and enjoy come up with exampl if they come up with some weak stori you learn someth extrem tell about whether youll be happi there  base on the interview we had today is there ani reason you could see me not fit this posit if they say yes you have an opportun to counter and make yourself look better if they say no then your in the clear serious the best question to ask at the end of ani interview do you like work here whi  make the employ think about his own job and he might say thing that werent plan befor hand and make the convers more person i find if the interview has gotten to the point where the question do you have ani question is ask then you like didnt get the job  a good interview will have a lot of back and forth the recruit or employ will say someth the potenti new hire will ask a question about it it a just a convers  it like go on a first date if the person your with has to ask ani question for me it make you seem like your not interest look back on the peopl that have held this posit in the past what do you think is the differ between do a good job and do a great job  make the interview think answer a question that is similar to the kind theyv been ask and give you a good idea of what theyr realli look for if the situat call for it you can emphas how your skill match whatev answer they give you but this may come off as tri too hard your call a friend of mine appli for an upper level busi posit straight out of undergrad with a multin pharmaceut compani when ask in the interview do you have ani question he brave ask what busi polici did compani put in place that help it surviv the recent econom downturn and would you say that your surviv the recess or thrive in the midst of it  that how 23 year old get upperlevel manag posit right out of colleg  ill take the second half of your question use real life exampl do not ask the follow   doe this job come with an offic   your not go to call my previous employ are you    are there a lot of women on the team i work better with men   are you flexibl with start time i like to sleep in one thing that alway stick in my head when i see these type of post is ask the person interview you what do you like about work at insert compani just wonder as interview do you enjoy get the same fuck answer over and over from interviewe doe it basic come down to who answer the same tire out respons in the most confid manner are we tri to build robot  approach it like you have alreadi been given the job or are about to be given the job obvious do a common sens check first  dont do this to a hostil or disinterest interview   when would i be start id like to give proper notic  how doe the train process go  what do you like about this place  do you have ani advic about start on my first day  unless they have alreadi decid you are not a good choic this tend to get them think about you as someon about to start work there instead of just an interviewe this small shift in percept can make a big differ  what is the turnov rate  you want to know how often peopl leav the compani becaus that is a good indic of the work environ it a straightforward question that they cant bullshit unless they lie outright if it a high percentag you probabl dont want to work there this is awesom i liter have one of the most import interview in my life today at 5pm and this help a lot    ask about the interview histori with the compani  where did you start in the compani  most interview like to share what their journey look like to get into their current posit   do you press charg what would be the ideal thing for me to have achiev within the first six month of this role the best question ive ever been ask in this section of an interview was this  assum ive been hire what the best advic you can give me as a new employe that would help fit in to the cultur here there is not a set of fix question becaus the tone of what you ask should depend on the compani the interview and how the interview went but a coupl of thing you should ask about the follow tip assum that you are do the interview with the hire compani itself and not through a headhunt also there will be some hr buzzword speech in here    compani environ  ask the interview about how he like work on the compani demonstr interest in the work cultur this will help you evalu if you can work in their and show to him that you are interest in be more than a simpl cog but a team player    ask someth specif about someth the compani doe  do you research prior hand check the compani websit news articl etc tri to get some specif project that is public this is veri import dont fuck up ask about thing that should be secret but were leak and demonstr interest on the answer you need to abl to go beyond the call of duti for the compani    ask about benefitspay  unless this was brought up by the interview prior you should ask about it you dont want to sound desper but you need to show that you are assess them as much as they are do it to you this is a question that may backfir if the compani just want a grunt to squeez as much as possibl but if that is the case do you want to work for them    if you think that the interview is not go well and you wont be hire ask him whi they want to hire you  this isnt a veri good question to ask when you think you have a chanc to get the job and you want it becaus it may give the vibe that you are surpris you were pick at all but the answer here may help you in futur interview    ask about train in the compani this one is more common on the tech industri i think but may appli in other area but ask about if the compani incentivessp it employe to keep acquir knowledg ask about injob train this is even more import for entri level job    dont ask about possibl punish for errorsmisde  serious that is as huge as a red flag as ani other it send the messag that you either know that you are go to fuck up hard or that you are sleazi in ani case bottom of the pile for you if you have no question then here is a good one to use mrms hiringmanag it seem like you have a great team but there is just one glare problem with it paus for effect and or wait for them to ask what it is then say im not a part of it yet  i interview 24 peopl a month in person and remot through googl hangout or skype  it veri import you ask question  as the interview it like i have not spoken veri much in the last 45 minut  all my focus has been to get you talk answer question and solv problem  even if i am not the first person to interview you you should still have question  some good one ive receiv   how long have you work here and whi do you stay  ive read your blogkept up with your twitteri notic x could you elabor  what is it like work for x ceo    i use x product for a week befor this interview  i notic your not do y  what is the reason behind that  if you got sick tomorrow what is the process for be cover  how much would you pay out of pocket and how would your vacat or pay be affect  at the offer stage i was recent impress and somewhat depress that this doesnt come up more often   great your give me 1000 share as part of the compens packag  what are the current share outstand  what is the vest schedul  how are share treat in a liquid event    basic it is an ama  if you want the job you should have prepar question  even better if youv done some research on the person who is interview you sometim this is not possibl i understand  show a level of detail and interest in the daytoday oper is a huge plus  focus on cultur is a huge plus   i like to ask what is their least favorit or most difficult aspect of the job  or ask if they could chang one thing about the compani what would they chang what challeng do you see with a candid like myself in this role um i have one question whi in the world would 2500 peopl downvot this question there no one answer to this when interview i use it as a roundup question at the end as much for if ive miss anyth obvious they were wait to hear  i expect to hear someth a reason intellig question about the job the compani or someth weve said dure the interview mayb someth technic about equip servic hour or staff  if noth theyr unimagin or not interest   if ive alreadi cover that their attent span or memori is poor   it not a trick question as such it anoth tool to tri and understand the person their perform dure the interview their person manner and social skill  i ask do you have ani question twice dure the interview the first time is earli in the interview after ive given a general overview of the posit and the organ i just want to make sure they clear understand the role and it respons the second time is near the end of the interview obvious most peopl know that this question signal the end of the interview and so it is a conveni way to signal that i also think that allow the applic to relax somewhat and so i may be abl to get a better glimps of their person  anyway there no right or wrong answer to this question except for one path not ask ani question at all this is your opportun to build some sort of rapport with the interview to make yourself memor to address ani weak your job applic might have  tell me someth posit that the compani has done or accomplish in the last yearsometh you are realli proud of  this forc the interview to total step outsid of their box and think for a minut  i have peopl ask this all the time and am never disappoint  sourc im a recruit    have i answer all of your question suffici or do you have ani reserv that would prevent me from be offer the job  ive been on a lot of job interview over the last coupl of year here are question i alway ask   what are the 35 skill that the candid for this posit should have that will allow them to succeed in this roll   what are the top 3 thing about work at this compani   what are a coupl thing that are not so great about work at this compani   is this a new role or am i fill an exist posit if it an exist posit whi did the previous person leav   what are some of the littl thing that the compani doe that make an employe want to come to work everi day   if the compani is in a competit market i like to ask them what make them stand out amongst their competitor   not a recruit question but more of a immedi supervisor question  what has been the most enjoy thing youv work on over the last few year at the compani is there anyth about my background or qualif that youd like to learn more about  this has been a popular question interview seem to realli like it plus it prompt them to voic ani concern about your candidaci out loud so you have a chanc to address them the last success job interview i went on when the interview ask me if i had ani question i ask him to walk me through what my typic day would look like in the offic from start to finish i think this accomplish two thing let him know i was serious about want the opportun and it also gave me a better sens of what i was in for after that follow up question about insurance401ketc came from a more inform place becaus i knew i want the job you could ask them what they most enjoy about work for compani name here  op you had 2 of the 3 in your post   what make someon success in this role   what have you seen caus peopl to struggl with the role   how did i do and how do i stand in comparison to other candid  veri last question of interview some question i ask are   what is a typic day like  is there ani room for growth or advanc  whi is the posit open  what is the compani cultur like  what are some challeng one would face in this role  what do you enjoy about work at this compani  are there ani question or concern you have about my abil to do this job well  what are the next step you should know what your deal breaker are  ask question that polit probe for the answer to those  for me programm i want to know where work origin and how it priorit  id ask them to walk me through a workflow you need to ask question that show you have done your homework and prove to the interview that you want this jobnot just the first job you get an offer letter for say im good i think you cover everyth is a cop out ask about where compani x is head in the next 612 month what happen to the person current in the role what are some signific challeng face compani x in the short and long term rememb a good interview should be sell you on whi compani x is so great alway go in with the mindset of compani a should want to hire me becaus i am the most qualifi applic the one question i alway ask besid other is if i was to ask one of your employe what it like work here what would they say you can alway tell if it a bullshit answer or they will be straight up i ask this on an interview and the boss total took it in and say well to me i think they would say it a relax but focus environ but all ill let my employe tell you go ask them i got the job  what day is the companyprostitut  in the offic   will my compani car be a porsch or better  for my report will it need a banana for sale    when they get mad at your question get up and storm out of mcdonald you dont need that job anyway what do you feel separ your compani from your competitor  ive ask this a few time to seem good success it a bit more less clich than what is the cultur like  i get some person insight on the compani cultur and even how the differ depart in the compani work togeth as a whole to excel instead of just what your area may be  it also make it seem like you are particular interest in the field and that you are look elsewher too potenti their competitor in which case the employ is like to be pressur to respond sooner rather than later on your interview if they like you   basic if the interview goe well up to that point it will get the interview to start sell the compani to you instead of you sell yourself to the compani and will also most like give you topic to launch more question off of you should ask the sort of question that you couldnt get answer by do general research on the internet or other form of media  you want to make it clear that youv done your homework on the compani  in fact if you can get clarif or an insid perspect on some of the question that you have thought of while do your research on the compani that send a strong messag that you are interest in their busi and have made a solid effort to understand it  even if your in a support role you should never underestim the valu of understand the busi  next i would probabl ask question about team dynam a quick overview of a day in the life type of question  it show that your not just interest in the compani but in the specif role that you would be hire for and how you would integr to the larger organ  anoth good question is to find out what your top two or three prioriti would be onc you are hire  it show that you want a chanc to start think about respons in advanc so that you can hit the ground run  i find that mani peopl spend the entir interview talk about their qualif and what theyv done in the past and spend veri littl time talk about what theyr go to do off topic but whatev  i withdrew my applic for a job onc becaus the manag assist was the one deal with me and kept on refer to the guy as mr  so i ask her if everyon call him mr  and she said oh yes  i email her to withdraw and when she ask whi i told her the mr thing was a sign the cultur wouldnt be a good fit comment so i can come back to this when i hope start receiv job interview it is a riski one as you can look like a dick if not done proper and work best if it for a sale base role but if you think the interview went well say what would the next stage of interview be i feel today went well and think id be well suit for the posit but do you have ani reserv about put me forward for the next stage at that point if there ani reserv they do have you have the chanc to fight your corner also as i say if it a sale posit it show you have the skillbal to close a deal in an assumpt way employ here question mention here are great howev if you realli want to impress ask follow up question if you just shoot a list of question it feel regiment and rehears follow up question allow you to get more inform but they also show the interview that you are genuin interest s what do you think someon with my background would struggl with on the first 6 month of this posit it expos whatev weak the person interview you think you have and give you a chanc to disprov them engin hire manag here interviewe question are most import when i am screen someon on the phone tri to determin whether it will be product to bring them in for an inperson interview loop  the question they ask account for about 30 of my decis here how it work i start off with introduct and explain what my compani doe and what the role involv then i ask the candid question from what theyv done in the past to what they are look to do in the futur i finish my part with a few progress more interest technic question then i ask them the have you ani question piec  this is realli your time to shine show me that youv at least look up our compani onlin and know what we do show me that your engag by ask a few reason question it doesnt even matter what you ask i just want to see that there a brain tick away in there and that it is engag ive brought peopl in who didnt do great on the technic part but who ask a lot of good question  now all that said some good question to ask are  what are the most difficult and interest technic and busi problem face the compani  what is the product roadmap like how do you develop the product roadmap  how is technic architectur done  how do peopl in the group i am come into interact with other group  what is the compani mission and goal for the next year or two  what are the skill and person of the peopl in my team  what are the career growth path avail to me  how deepli doe upper manag get involv in the day to day oper of my team ampc you get the idea i like to ask my employ if your travel in a car at the speed of light and you turn the headlight on doe anyth happen if they hesit i tell them i dont want to work for them i post this help guid a few day ago in rresum

question about the compani are great the job duti compani cultur question but if all els fail rememb to find out when you can expect to hear back from them one way or anoth if your the interview and the candid doesnt ask this questionansw it for them  the technic guy who is brought in to the interview to check out your skill couldnt care less about the interview formal we think about interview

two interview i have today i feel so well prepar now thank reddit  i alway ask question about the person interview me and relat them to the compani some exampl   whi did you settl on this compani   how long have you been work here usual in the interview they drop this so this is kind of a freebi   what your favorit aspect about come to work what do you love about your job   what benefit do you love that the compani has or doe  i usual tri to squeez in at least three question the tabl turn and they see your take an interest in them and the compani  i have no idea of this would translat well out of my field comput program but like this  i know this is kind of unusu but if ive at least piqu your interest id love the chanc to come in for an hour or two and work direct with one of your peopl on a real problem you have  that would give me some real insight into what you guy do and give you an actual view of how i work how well id fit in with the team and how quick i learn  even if they dont take you up on it you were the guy that just blunt but polit state that you want to take a bet on them see the real you  nb this trick is probabl not advis if you are bad at your job echo some of what alreadi been said 1 question about the compani  2 question about the hire manag job or what his expect are 3 what type of projectsdaytoday activ youll be involv in 4 what futur project are in store for the compani what kind of benefit yall got up in this piec i actual like to put some pressur back on the recruit dure that phase of the interview i found one except good question that usual

person who will have influenc over your worklif and career  in a group interview onc i stood out of the crowd by ask the interview manag who would be your ideal candid for this posit and organ and what qualiti would this person entail ask no bullshit question about the compani   who are you go to be work withfor     how doe the compani or divis if it a huge compani futur look     what are you opportun for growthadvanc  just ask isnt enough you should press them on these question just like they would press you  dont settl for the compani line get down to realiti ive found it popular when i ask what would you consid the best and worst thing work here   think back to peopl who have been in this posit previous what differenti the one who were good from the one who were realli great  read this on the ask a manag bloggreat resourc for job seeker btw 1 can you describ a typic day in this type of role 2 how long have you been at the compani and what make you stay 3 how would you describ the work environ and corpor cultur 4 what are some of the goal for the compani in the short and longer term 5 how would my perform be measur 6 what type of career opportun may open up down the road for a person start out in this type of posit assum they perform well 7 what are some of the compani initi regard learn and employe develop i like to have a list of question written down that i can make note on dure the interview that way when it come to it i can rehash the answer one and ask the one that havent been answer  some that arent alway cover are   how well do you think i will fit into the team  base on the interview what do you think my strength will be in the role  i alway ask the interview what keep you at this compani what is it about this cultur and environ that has you work here   it slight calm me by have the tabl turn and have them answer more question it give me an insight into the compani intern dynam and veri import i learn a littl someth about my prospect new boss profession recruit here one question that i think is great for interviewe is if i were to get this job what would be your expect of me for the first 3 month or a relat time i want you to ask me someth like tell me about the difficult part of this job and the easi part interview here for a major usa summer camp agenc in the uk  ask about my experi with the job i could be potenti give you  with the experi i have had can help you understand if the job is realli for you year ago one of my job was the hire of the front offic person did my due dilig of find the best person for the job was pretti good at it but after a while it turn out no matter how good the person was they were done with the job in about 15 year onc i figur that out i hire most by how good the boob look they also last about the same time but had the ad benefit of more repeat custom  read the annual report of the compani your appli to there a treasur trove of info in it ask relev busi question base on your understand of the compani from the report also mention youv read it for a new employ   how will my perform be evalu   what do you or each of you feel is the most import characterist for a success candid for this posit this question work best if you ask befor the interview begin it also give you a chanc to show that you memor your interview name  for a promotiontransf  ask what they think is the biggest challeng face you in the promot or transfer ask what type of train our feed back you can anticip to help address those challeng  as someon look to fill a posit within a good compani there are onli two point that they should be look for  1 doe the person have the skillsabl to do the job 2 how long will the person stay with the compani  the first half of the interview the interview will assess you on the first point they will look at what skill you have proven you have through your resum and make a judgment on what potenti you may have past that this is general veri straight forward more credenti often time win here  the second is much harder for the interview to make a call on you can onli learn so much about a person in a 30minut formal interview howev it is as import if not more so than the first for myself person hear the cooki cutter question turn me off a candid so quick  to me the best question are one that show me that they are interview the compani as much as i am interview them ask about the cultur is a great start some question to get you start may be around how much time do peopl spend work in isol vs in team ask for exampl of how the compani invest in it peopl or even ask hard question around what type of turn over rate the compani has  if the employe is go to meet the second question of how long they will stay with the compani it is one that work both way the compani will keep him as long as his work is good but if the employe stay he need to feel like the compani is a good fit for him so ask those question make me feel better about take a chanc on you are you happi work here  this is my favourit question whi   it is open enough for the interview to talk about what he realli like and dislik about the job and it worklif balanc  if the interview is happi he will feel good talk about it and you leav the interview in a posit note  if the interview is unhappi chanc are you should not take the job  it is imposs to fake an answer  howev be advis that this question might backfir in two way   the interview may feel uncomfort special if you didnt connect dure the interview if you are unsur you can alway ask if it ok to ask a person question altern a safer but less effect question can be are peopl usual happi about work here  the interview may say hes unhappi this pretti much kill your chanc of be offer the job but again chanc are that a good outcom  sourc im an interview at a major profession servic compani  edit format ask me thing that make me know you were pay attent   did i describ your role in a team if not ask how big is the team how is the team lead  is it a democraci or a dictatorship if there a new idea or a new way of do someth who decid whether or not that a path worth take nobodi go to tell you that all tech decis get made by the financ guy and forc down your throat but they may tell you that new idea get vet through a review committe to which youll have no access or they may tell you that youll have complet autonomi to do what you want as long as it work hope they answer somewher in between those two extrem    did i tell you how big of a group your work in did i give you exampl project if not ask if your assign to a specif team do you stay on that team for week month year if i didnt tell you ask are there opportun to move upward in the compani not in term of salari but in term of respons in a 20 person compani there onli so mani manag role but in a 2000 person compani what doe advanc look like   small town busi owner here it servic for small busi amp residenti and in a former life an engin group manag with hire author  from my perspect if your go to ask just one question make it  what can i do to make us both the compani and yourself as an employe success in my first month and my first year work here   that cover cultur how to fit in and mutual mentor expect on both side of the desk as well as give you a road map let me get career advic from a site that heavili popul with unemploy 20someth the question you must ask not to impress them but to make sure you want the job is this  what about the person i would be replac whi they dont have the job ani more did they leav get fire what happen i think the problem with this question is that if you are under 30 or newish to the field you are appli you may not have enough experi to know what you are look for  i had sever job befor i knew what was a good work environ for me and what wasnt  up until then my criteria was that it paid enough money and the work seem interest enough   a good friend has been look for a job the past year  she has the fund to take her time and the life experi to know what she has enjoy in her work life and what she has not  so when she interview she has a lot of question  shes not go to wast her time with a bad fit  but 20 year ago she would have been tri to come up with someth that sound like an intellig question   i got my current job main becaus when they ask if i had ani question i ask what do you like most about work here my boss mention it the other day and how she still rememb it out of the hundr of interview shes done one of the nicest thing about be self employ is know i will never have to endur this bullshit ever again   alway alway finish my interview with do you think i would be a great fit for your compani follow up with how do you think i did today nobodi like to be put on spot so most peopl will tell you did well and it get them see you actual work for that compani also you get to learn your strong and weak point about the interview by ask what you did well my favorit last question to ask if now that youv heard about me is there anyth about this posit that you think im not qualifi for so i can address it now  this way if they have concern you can address them immedi and if they dont it reassur both you and the interview that you are qualifi it also make you come across as selfawar and want to improv ive alway been pretti good at interview i alway ask 1 where would my desk be 2 where would we have meet when you ask those question the employ will subconsci visual you work for them by appli you to those physic spot in their offic or wherev it may be then after that i ask them how long they have been with the compani if they have enjoy it and what they like and expect out of an employe noth wrong with a littl bit of small talk it show that your friend and easi to talk to  research the compani you got the interview for and write down question your curious about memor these question and ask them at the end of the interview and i guarante that you will go up on the list of potenti hire it will show that your genuin interest in the compani ive done this for my last job and im still work here edit charliepag nail it in the top comment after an extens interview with one guy he drop this nowfavorit seri of question on me at the end  he ask so will i be work direct with you or under you  me  the person we hire would be work direct with me yes  him  what is current your biggest challeng in your duti and what specif could i do to help you overcom that challeng while tackl the respons for the empti posit  it was subtl as obvious if someon is be hire and is work direct with me they will natur be help me to overcom ani challeng im deal with  howev it show he was enthusiast want to build a relationship which show a desir to remain at the compani for some time and he valu the idea of teamwork  further his phrase came off as genuin want to be help and not as look to take my posit befor he was even hire  needless to say he got the job job are gay gthave you ani question  mayb talk correct where should i put all of my stuff  i usual ask the employ what is it like on a day to day basi at the compani what my perform is measur by and what make them like the compani to stay with them for so long  whi has the posit becom avail what the dress code is there anyth i shouldnt wear  you should ask question to find out what you genuin want to know if your passion about your work it will have shun through throughout the interview and you will have alreadi have ask enough bullshit question get a minus point from me becaus i see it as someon tri to tick the right box not genuin show me how good they are i never want someon who blind follow process i want someon who take pride in do the best job they can after all i have to work 40 hour a week and i would rather be with a passion person than an anal box ticker you should ask these 3 question at a minimum  1 how will i be evalu 2 how often will i be evalu 3 base on your experi what are the biggest barrierschalleng you see me face in the next 369 month on the job in an interview with two manag one 50 the other 60 i ask how do you use technolog to achiev your goal  they look at each other complet dumbfound then look back and me and said well that probabl someth whoever we hire will help us with  i never claim to be especi good with offic technolog but by ask that question they assum i was and i maintain to this day that whi i got the job   in the end they reject 90 of my effort to modern the offic is it possibl to ask too mani question short answer make most of your question up dure the interview   ive interview hundr of candid over my career  im one of the depart two gatekeep interview  if you cant pass the phone interview we dont go to the face to face level   if you make it to the face to face level you will be interview multipl peopl in the same day  everi one of us will ask do you have ani question for us and we will potenti share what you say do and ask     therefor your question should fall into three categori exercis on which is more import left to you and i will explain whi after the list  1 get a person opinion from multipl peopl on stock question  2 get specif inform base on the role the person play in the compani  as in sometim youll meet with tech support hr manag market sale    dont ask the sale rep about 401k and dont ask the tech support person about the program work    _do_ ask the manag if theyr more of a handson manag or if they prefer to have peopl who are independ selfstart   3 stuff you heard them mention dure the interview    to me this is the most import  i want to know  were you pay attent to what ive been say or are you just run a script in your head   think of the interview as an oral exam with a side of improv  each interview need to come away with an impress of you   prefer good   if you ask zero question that come across as passiv      if the onli question you ask are about compens vacat time and flexibl hour  i will see you as someon who is less interest in the job and more interest in the money   if you ask about the compani direct and im not in market ill give you point for do your homework but sinc im not in manag i cant realli answer that for you    tri ask everyon how long theyv work here and how much they like work here    if the averag is over 5 year and nobodi under 3 that usual mean it a pretti solid group with low turnov   if theyr go to be peer or it the hire manag do ask about what project they think youll be work on to start   if you can match that to someth you research on the websit ask for more product detail how long has this product been on the market do custom like it how easi is it to learnsupport   ask what sort of train is avail for the toolsproduct   the best question if you dont know what to ask howev  ask me what im work on    youll get in one respons     a how much workload i have       b if i like what im do  this is import becaus you might be help me      c how complex the project are      d if i like what im do  itll be written all over my face in the tone of my voic and how excitedfrustr i am to be work with the compani   bonus tip  alway have at least one or two signatur success stori in your back pocket     career moment of awesom be it in colleg or previous job    if the hire manag hasnt ask a question to prompt you for this stori ask this question  do i have time to share an experi i had that i think make me ideal for this posit  howev dont tell the same stori everi interview  it your home run pitch so use it wise  hope this help i love to ask base on our interview are there ani concern that i could clarifi for you  base on experi they actual let you know when do i start my go to question  what would i have done for the organ that a year from now would make you say hire me was a realli good idea  the answer general give a good idea of what the job entail what project are come up and what i would be work on  all the car in your employe park lot are a pos doe that mean you dont pay anyon here well i have a job interview tomorrow am now scare to use these for fear interview is a redditor  i wish reddit would have been around when i graduat colleg  i look like an idiot on more than interview when ask this question  a lot of peopl here say that it not onli import to ask question dure this part but also stress that it might look bad if you dont ask question caus it make you look desper  rais your hand if youv ever been unemploy and desper for incom im an admiss interview for a top rank graduat program and have done hundr of interview for four differ compani my advic below  i for one dislik contriv question ask for the purpos of demonstr the candid has done their research that is just show off  to me a question should be relev to the employ discuss at hand  cultur person experi possibl chang org structur how talent is evalu etc  dont ask me about an irrelev newspap articl to show me you read it  the best interview usual dont have to end with ani question becaus the candid doe a good job of make it convers without domin the interview    one mistak ive made as a candid is to ask too mani question at the end hope to impress or keep the convo go  i now make it a point to be mind of the interview time    final note  by the time question roll around the decis has usual been made but you can alway blow thing up with a dumb question  now isnt the time to shoot for a homerun  especi if you think it go well  i work in helicopt emerg medic servic i ask about safeti and train if that offend them i dont want to work for them if they take pride in their respons i want the job that more bad  is there ani reason you think i would not be qualifi for this posit  an it recruit advis me to ask that at my last interview  it kind of caught my interview offguard and they said that a realli good question  it then give you a chanc to explain ani doubt they may have or possibl quick research someth after your done with the interview to prove to them your capabl of learn new thing one of the question i alway ask if speak to someon a the appropri level is what salari rang doe this posit usual fall into  so mani peopl have a phobia of breach this topic but they shouldnt   i cant recal how mani time i went through multipl level of interview onli to find that the salari in question was 20k or more out of bound  i dont want to wast my time and also i dont want to wast the time of the prospect employ  it a shame when the peopl you interview with were realli excit to work with you and then when everyth look great the number dont add up  it take the employ time to put togeth a packag and get the paperwork done for an offer etc  also if they want to respond to your question it give you a chanc to be honest with them about your salari requir  be honest and open and if it a good fit that one less roadblock to worri about later i might be a bit late to the parti but saw thishttpimgurcomgallerytab22l0 post on imgurl a month ago and felt that it could be relev as someon who has been interview for job recent this is an extrem use post thank i ask what do you think you could do better here at compani name and that got me my job at the moment it make them reflect on their weak make them a littl vener and then you can see how you can help with that as an jobsearch who has been told in each interview that i ask the perfect question to the interviewe ask this question whi do you like to work  this will tell you so much inform about the job what the environ and expect are what the custom base is etc etc etc and it turn the interview around and put them in your spot for a bit  they love this question i love ask it and i love the answer  it let me know whether or not i realli want to work at the place in question honest i dont have ani expect that youll ask question but im not oppos to them either  obvious there are some question that might make you look bad but i cant say ive ever been ask those    rememb that your interview the compani too  so what do you want to know about the compani  as an interview my answer may make you decid that you dont want to work for me  so ask me what i like about my job  compani what are the biggest challeng  thing id fix etc  i general like to prais the thing i like and complain about the thing i dislik this is gonna get buri but if it a sale job your after make sure you attempt a close at the end of the interview  someth like when can i expect to be hire or is there ani reason you wouldnt hire me  ive interview probabl about 100 differ peopl for sale posit and from my experi if you dont at least tri to close the sale on me hire you chanc are your not close on much els      this would have been help this morn you son of a bitch what are the 3 main thing your look for in a success candid i liter just walk an interviewe out of the build befor i took lunch im still not sure what to think about it but the guy ask me if someon less qualifi than me was will to take this job for 5000 less per year who would you hire   it seem like a ballsi question to me but it forc me to think about how import i felt the posit was for the compani move forward if anyon with hr experi is read this how would you react to that question whi didnt i read this an hour ago just had an interview tdcc has help get me through my teen year person i like tourist histori

guitaristlead singer came to my new year parti a coupl year ago act like a jackass drank far more than his fair share of the beer stash from the big fridg and spent the night but in to convers by say yeah but im in two door cinema club so the one true what you knowhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvn5liwti4vuw i absolut love tdcc i had no idea how creativ and awesom their music video were  hellooo cigarett in the theatr best of all the tune listen to it again and again you will know what im talk about realli enjoy tourist histori a few summer ago but sad they got burn kind of went from super hip and happi to meh and unknown what up with indi band name  theyr soooo stupid lol engin master student who has work as a research assist in this exact field  my research has been at loughborough univers where the build freeform project is be develop wwwbuildfreeformcom  allow me to debunk some thing  1 contour craft is a few year old now and it isnt be persu ani longer in the context of cementiti construct khoshnevi is now work on a nasa project for lunar construct use rock sinter deposit powder lunar regolith and zap it with a laser to melt it into a structur in contrast build freeform at loughborough is still develop cementiti construct techniqu focus on reinforc and mix design rather than mechan issu  2 the 24 hour hous come with a lot of caveat the general opinion now is that if you are build a bunch of hous all togeth you will averag 1day this will go up if you have lower hous ie fewer storey the main constraint is the harden of the concret it is possibl to print about 60 layer of 9mm concret befor slump becom an issu after youv done 60 layer you have to wait for it to harden which take sever hour  3  a full hous could theoret be built with current tech howev becaus of build code etc it would have to be torn down anyway it wouldnt be veri safe to occupi my research is on the reinforc of this concret which would be necessari befor it is implement in real structur if i recal correct the largest thing khoshnevi has built is a shedsiz structur  becaus of cost remedi work the construct industri is veri slow to adopt new technolog contractor would rather have high confid of get some profit than less confid get of get a bit more profit howev for part like wall panel which arent structur the chanc of cost failur is much less build freeform is aim at fill that gap and produc curvi concret wall panel which can have ani curv within reason for implement in real build   this is where khoshneviss project was so ahead of it time that it wasnt success in the construct field he tri to do too much and the limit of the construct industri were the constraint not his imagin or engin abil khoshnevi has a background in mech eng so he solv most of the mechan problem but didnt have the construct experi to know that it wouldnt be accept readili howev his expertis are perfect for the nasa project  4 this tech wont be appli in build for at least a coupl of decad the research just isnt there yet the first place it will be use will be in non structur part and it will be use for thing with curv shape which would not be possibl to make out of concret use tradit techniqu there will like be no huge loss of job or huge industri chang   moreov when the tech is still in it infanc there will be a rise in factori produc part for build prefabr which can be fit with some degre of autom skill worker like plaster and carpent will find work there there is also the possibl that they will still be need to appli finish touch to build anyway  howev i would argu that it might be for the best the construct industri if bloodi danger there are ton of accid and mani death basic all of which are prevent autom the process like the aerospac and automot industri have done would lead to increas profit decreas time increas qualiti etc  5 peopl would probabl not be ani better equip to design their own hous or download a hous than they alreadi are design will be complic and will requir experienc engin or architect to check them anyway such as is alreadi the case 3dpc would open up the abil to have curv wall or other featur much more easili than today particular in doubli curv surfac 3dpc excel  feel free to ama no rebarhttpenwikipediaorgwikirebar in sight im out gtthe 3d printer develop by professor behrokh khoshnevi from the univers of southern california could be use to build a whole hous layer by layer in a singl day  can and could are not the same you wouldnt download a hous i want them to name the hous printer steve i would also like to place my order by show them my virtual blueprint from minecraft  new  yeah no contour craft has been around for year still havent built ani real hous with it afaik  hell he made the hous in a day claim 4 year ago as long as your hous doesnt need ani electr or plumb or insul or door these kind of news articl sigh how about includ a pictur of a hous built with this thing here the research home page  linkhttpwwwcontourcraftingorg  the technolog has been around for year to my knowledg no largescal devic have been built didnt they have a work prototyp of this like 2 year ago what with all the press on this now ive seen like 3 articl in the last week the propos applic of this doesnt make sens to me whi would you use a giant 3d printer with pickandplac capabl to addit build a standard straightwal hous like they show in their promot video   httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvyviwdsdn  the machin is pick up and insert frame compon anyway it seem to me that the valu of print build materi at that scale would be to make custom complex arbitrari structur shape that would be costprohibit to manufactur elsewher and ship in whi not use standard prefab techniqu which are cheaper and faster than this and then use the 3d printer where it has real valu remind me of terran build structur in starcraft 2  bah  the amish have been do this for centuri and without electr  sorri your hous could not be complet as you are run low on cyan it it still veri much in develop  they have a prototyp that can deposit the cementati materi but that is it  there is still a hell of a lot more to do befor it can build a hous they took arr jeb pc load concret  what the fuck doe that mean what kind of mexican name is 3d printer  and then it onli take anoth 24 hour for the whole thing to collaps  just becaus 3d printer can make stuff that look like other stuff doesnt mean it just like the real thing it took our job usa vs europ  in europ there is a lot of stone construct for hous raw stone concret cmu concret block etc in my experi in tusa most east of the mississippi that is far rarer my cultur bias is that a home with stonework on the insid is realli uncomfort sure a chimney or an accent wall with nice brick but a whole hous ive live in concretewal type home in a number of european countri and alway felt it was less comfort than wood and sheet rock in america  again it just a cultur bias but i think it real i think the concret home is far more appeal in europ where it more normal and id bet in the southwest where a dri heat climat make stone build much more comfort  the liber in me thought three thing  1 this build two stori singl or two presum famili home if the context is peopl move to urban area that the wrong build type we need densiti which mean we need taller build than this seem to present  2 yes it look like it will take a whack at middl class blue collar job that a trend weve been on for a few decad now and i dont realli think it for the better im not argu that we should pay peopl 50kyr to dig hole and other peopl 50kyr to fill them in but the hollow of the middl class for me is a real social problem that this exacerb  3 this could be realli realli great for climat chang issu ignor the urban sprawl problem in 1 abov if it mean home are built tight and with high insul we could realli take a bite out of the fossil fuel use use for heat nat gas propan fuel oil elec and for cool elec residenti and small commerci structur that would be a good thing how is the structur qualiti of the print materi affect by the print process i mean in a general sens can you for exampl print tool that are compar durabl to tool from tradit product i read hors and was like  you can order a precast concret hous right now today they precast the panel in the control environ of the factori with all the window and door in their proper place and all the conduit for wire in place they then come to the site with all the panel and simpli put them togeth like build block a typic hous can be put togeth in one day it then need to be finish off on the insid wire pull joint caulk window trim etc but there is that technolog right now the amount of pessim in the thread is too damn high   how about some optim for the futur of build construct   anyon anyon   this is strang relev now  httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvbjtkh7sh_a0 anyon els think that after you build your new hous tanya might come and blow it up

have built with it becaus it seem like someon has had an idea about someth and have jump from there to the bit where they trumpet what a game changer it is without you know actual do it build it prove it is possibl    if this was a real viabl thing that the design believ in we would be watch a video of it work and look at photo of the result hous rememb that clever design someon came up with for inflat concret impregn canva structur and set them befor turn them into emerg build the first time i heard about it was a video of them do it that how it should be done

thing might work doe not mean that this technolog exist you wouldnt download a hous i just invent a new car that fli it not real yet but i invent it concret absorb oxygen they had to remov it from the biodom becaus the inhabit were near suffoc im sure this wouldnt be a huge issu as these hous wouldnt be in someth like a biodom but still i would like to to see a 24 hr time lap gif of this pleas they should make the machin look like a robot that poop out a hous and gruntingwinc as it doe so shouldnt this post titl read new giant 3d printer could build a hous in 24 hour say that it can impli that it has been done and this video is about an unexecut concept right becaus were not alreadi struggl to find job for everyon right let put some construct worker out of a job too i read this headlin as  can build a hors in 24 hour dont know if im disappoint or not yeah one that will collaps in 48 hour but will it blend gt the technolog may potenti reduc energi use and emiss by use a rapidprototyp or 3d print process to fabric larg compon accord to the project websit  i dont realli understand how they come to this conclus concret is a veri energyintens materi to produc and transport here your reduc some use of machineri on site but i would think that would be far less than the extra energi and truck requir for all the extra concret in this build it would be interest to see how this method compar just for make prefabr concret compon but otherwis use 3d print concret to replac timber element is a backward step in term of sustain construct let save call it new till when they have actual made the machin for now let call it a theoret giant 3d printer waytogetmyhopesup it sadden me thoigh that they focus more on the moon than on peopl who may need this kind of technolog  im most think third world area but it might also be a great help in rebuild home for victim of eartquak and tornado this is old news let us know when this guy final start print actual hous great if you want a hous without ani insul light heat ac cabl modern conveni now i want a 3d printer that can build me a planet we were also told you could make a gun with a 3d printer turn out it can onli have one bullet and has a tendenc to explod when use  what im say is take this with a grain of salt where the rebar i wouldnt live in one of these thing but it may have applic for disast zone how do they tile the articl this and not includ a pictur of a hous i want to see the print hous as nice a concept as it is the idea of live in a plastic shitti jigsaw hous isnt that appeal  can i build it in my 300sq ft flat im wait for when we can have a walk and climb 3d printer this printer wouldnt need human to arrang the piec togeth it would just get into the right place and print more it would use sensor and mathemat to approxim posit  but can it 3d print me a girlfriend as someon who has work with concret    concret take time to hardencur  how the fuck do you do that without form cool concept but who would want to wear those lame glass all the time idoru anyon  but how long doe it take to make one of those 3d printer im current do my dissert on this anyon wanna help me  remind me of the lego machin where you could put a pen in it and then it would write what you program it to write the printer build it too hehe he said erect and readi for action didnt this exact stori hit the front page of reddit like 45 day ago whi is this here again can frame a hous in 24 hrs  insul electr plumb floor tile wood carpet sheetrock mud tape sand trim paint side your hous is still gonna cost a shitload serious question im alway see amaz post about 3d printer are there ani negat aspect to have this technolog a new giant hurrican can tear down this hous in 24 second i could see general materi be construct but how we defin hous is probabl better call a shack im guess it cool to see advanc of this tech but let not kid ourselv of what were do here  i met professor khoshnevi back when i was in colleg around 2004 he talk about his 3d print of home contour craft etc etc i was veri impress   over the year i have stumbl across news articl on this topic and they all go back to referenc khoshnevi and his work truth is it been almost 10 year and the report provid no substanti updat he is nowher closer to realiti now than back when i first met him httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvu4kfjztaj5i  so it a giant spiney unchang piec of plastic has sien gone tooo far i hadnt heard about this for year and was wonder whether it was go to actual happen or not it was on a ted talk a few year back the onli thing i think they need to add is releas a softwar to their custom that allow them to design their own hous it would be program to point out structur error and other such flaw befor it would let you final and submit the design you want the futur is here most peopl spent all their money on hous when this becom cheap enough will we final start work less or will we find some new money dump for all our excess money hurray hous for everyon boo no job for million of peopl there are similar method of rapid hous construct  httpenwikipediaorgwikiprefabricated_hom  httpenwikipediaorgwikimodular_hom  httpenwikipediaorgwikimanufactured_h this is the sort of stuff i like to imagin but that still seem complet far fetch it weird see someon that actual has the genius to make it would all of the door and window have arch top    i cant see how they wouldnt if the process doesnt involv manual put beam in over everi door and window i guess print at kinko will get more interest  that not a hous more like a room  dont let the korean get a hold of this technolog they will expand take more resourc and then drop marin in your backyard it is a littl mislead see as how it cannot build more than just the framework of the hous that not to say that this couldnt be a good idea in the futur if this can be done right it can definit reduc the cost of home by a good margin but you will alway need the skill specif craftsman  a hous made of concret sound like a nightmar if you live in a place that actual has season winter will turn your hous to a freezer and summer will actual bake you whi the fuck are wast time tri to print hous  what we need to do is figur out how to print programm bitch  this is a imo total feasibl concept  but doe not exist yetoh and concret wall do not a hous make amaz scari too just a tad  as if the unemploy rate isnt high enough now someon is tri to put even more construct peopl out of work  now if the hous suffer a structur failur who get su the manufactur the oper the programm the materi provid or the machin d what a jump we went from print cheaper action figur to real estat in a matter of month let me know when there a video but will it blend i assum this is so the robot can build jail and slaughterhous for their human slave onc the robopocalyps is upon us i would use my giant 3d printer to print off two more giant 3d printer and then use my three giant 3d printer to finish my hous in 8 hour instead of 24  kiss a bunch more job goodbi check out this documentari futur by designhttptopdocumentaryfilmscomfuturebydesign the guy is a bit of a nut but hes got great idea im pretti sure quick manufactur hous in larg quantiti is one of his ideaspredict new scienc is cool but it seem new technolog is at war with job in a time we dont have job to spare i guess all the truck and cab driver whom are put out of work by driverless car and construct worker whom dont get to lay block or pour cement can all chip in and buy some cardboard box and sit under a bridg   i know it not quit there yet but sweet babi jesushttpimgurcomgz262p0 this is just one step closer to be abl to build a hous like you would in the sim i for one welcom the day when robot do all our job for us  and then kill us all becaus we are utter useless correct it can build the piec of the hous in 24 hour  show me a machin that can build the piec to the hous and build the hous and ill be amaz   anyway this is sweet now if they could have it produc a mortgag in 24 hour that would be realli amaz with tradit mobil home construct in a factori a hous can be built and put on a truck in a day or two and you know it meet build code and wont collaps with the first earth quack    edit you can build bigger structur this way by assembl the part like a lego set the build are not alway pretti but they are quick to build and perfect for remot deploy   httpfilesarchinectcomuploadsaiaiu_mac20jpg ok but can it print me bitcoin and snozzberri but can it blend could doesnt exist yet are they go to 3d print all the electr line and plume as well i would love to have a 3d print concret hous as long as i get input in it design  nice ted talk from 2012  httptedxtalkstedcomvideotedxojaibehrokhkhoshneviscon i wonder what impact this would have on the hous market my guess is wed have anoth cataclysm drop in hous price becaus manufactur them would be cheaper without the need for human labor   edit not to mention the dramat increas in suppli of hous unit i hope this kind of technolog remain free ie open sourc so peopl would solv problem like homeless on their own or with minim cost think of chariti fund use their money to do such thing the possibl inkjet compani are saliv at this soon concret price will skyrocket da bear  i have no idea

introduct by the translat and that was it   so ani sale at all prove that someon is not too bright to begin with   the translat introduct was enlighten i think it was written befor wwii it point out the unrest that hitler was involv in and the beer hall putsch was a general dissatisfact with a group in the rhur that want to separ from germani  the general feel was that they were bought and paid for by the french govern intent on weak germani further   that kind of explain the overal anger of the german still simmer over how they were treat after wwi and be subject to this sort of treatment by the victor no wonder it was easi to get elect as the govern by appeal to the german feel of victim  time to get back at our tortur  it might also show whi some govern was will to let someon off the

alreadi weaken by poor pelvic muscl and a rectum that has alreadi prolaps sever time  if done correct the perform would constant be bear down keep their anus from close around the tissu and cut off the blood suppli which could be dead under the correct circumst onc done they just lube up the offend rectum and gentl push it back insid as long as they arent forc to prolaps on a regular basi in theori it could be a safe kink but will most like requir surgeri after their career is over to keep their bit from fall out everi time the pee take a shit vigor sex or even by cough i grew up on a

at kink no one is ever made to do anyth they do not want to do and they are made awar of ani risk they may not have know of befor  gtnow in kyli case she has been do this kind of anal play amp is veri awar of the risk for a while now amp much of what you saw was her idea  now we discuss this veri topic on her radio show a few week ago becaus someon ask the same question as you did after watch her shoot   they love the shoot but were concern  this is what get her off amp what she love  gtlochai  kyli ireland post   gtplayboy radio and sirius archiv my show and random rerun them i would be happi to discuss it with you or anyon els who ask i have been perform anal sex on camera for over 10 year and anal sex is alway includ in my sexual play at home i have done research on it practic it safe and never outsid my comfort zone i speak public on my radio show in forum and at seminarspanel at convent about anal sex and my experi and what i find work for me i alway state the inform is base on my own person experi and i do not offer medic advic  gtproper done anal sex an incred sexual experi is not harm and doe not lead to ani problem later in life i do not have anal prolaps as you suggest anyon who is abl to relax their anal muscl enough usual after anal sex when most relax can push as if expel and the insid tissu can be seen some refer to this as a flower or a rosebud the muscl actual contract fair quick after anal sex return to their normal state as for your comment of might that be the reason she couldnt hold the water as you expect that is absolut not true and i would think that you shouldnt make assumpt of ani kind without all the fact  gtwhen lochai first spoke with me about do the scene he want to shoot the enema portion befor the sex scene i request that we shoot it after instead know my bodi the way i do with my past experi with enema and anal sex i knew that often a larg enema as with repeat rins can make my anal wall tender and sinc the main focus of the site was insert larg cock toy and hand i didnt want to experi ani difficulti insert larg toy due to tender also i know the way my bodi react to larg enema and colon that often water will be push far up insid and while this is certain not harm it often loosen thing up shall we say past where a normal enema might reach when use to cleans befor anal sex from a perform standpoint as well as my mental and physic comfort dure sex i didnt want to worri about anyth we might have loosen come out dure the scene for what it worth i know mani perform who feel exact the same way therefor we shot the scene one day and the enema the next day sorri if this is ruin the fantasi for ani of you but i feel it is better to address this truth than to have misconcept float around  gtaddress your specif concern might that be the reason she couldnt hold the water as you expect let me go into some detail as a perform even befor an enema scene i go through my ritual of cleans and prepar as i did that morn after my enema i take a dildo a smooth but what most would probabl consid rather larg one and insert it in my ass for the purpos of get ani leftov enema water out i do this sever time while this is a handi thing to do to allow ani remain water to come out it is also benefici befor a sex scene help to relax the muscl and prepar for sex i did do this on this particular morn while this aid in the prepar of my ass for larger insert it by no mean affect the muscl control  gti dont believ either lochai nor myself expect me to take the entir gallon of water dure the enema scene howev i am an overachiev i get off on shock valu and as a submiss i feel pride and accomplish at such a feat as far as the retent of cours water is go to leak out let me ask you this have you ever held a gallon of water in your ass while bound in an uncomfort and difficulttohold posit while stand in high heel no let me describ it for you it a bitch i was bound in a sit posit as if on an invis chair held firm by the rope yet not touch anyth for support i was be told to keep my balanc and hold still which was near imposs in high heel i am focus on pleas lochai do a good scene be brave do as i am told and hold an entir fuck gallon of water in my ass  fight graviti and the fact that my bodi was natur want to expel it as a doctor of gastroenterolog as you claim you sure should know how difficult that would be not expel

and that i will spend the senior year of my life in a diaper doesnt even make sens i thank you for your concern howev there is no damag be done to my ass  gtanal sex can be perfect safe even benefici

use forc and avoid the use of drug  jack morin phd a san francisco sex therapist and research is the author of anal pleasur and health a guid for men and women httpwwwsexualityorgauthorsmorinanalrulehtml   gtkyli  my emphasi hope a first hand account help your question  not an expert i just now learn anal prolaps porn was a nich after googl around fr a bit a few thing occur to me though  1 it possibl that the actress have been do rough anal for a while and it just now turn into a prolaps in that situat do some sort of nich porn regard it wouldnt be a huge problem sinc it someth the women would have come into the video shoot alreadi have go on  2 you can get surgeri to repair anal prolaps where they basic go in and reconstruct your anus and hold it in place with a mesh it possibl that the money for these type of shoot to help pay for it  3 some of these women may just straight up have mental health issu regard selfharm they may not be think lucid about what theyr do or just not think that far ahead  4 like anoth comment mention it possibl some of this is done with prosthet as in they put someth up her ass and then the actress push it out when the director want the prolaps to happen in that situat i guess you would just need to make sure that the backend of the prosthet was larger than her anal sphincter so it doesnt fall out when she push that obvious still not healthi but it at least better than if it were real delet warn do not googl prolaps porn i dont even know what i was expect how could someon find this type of porn arous regular porn is alreadi damag to most perform especi anal contrari to what porn tell you take some 89 incher doe not feel good to most women so for some the pain of a prolaps doe not matter  there are far more pain and liter damag thing peopl do like   sound the urethra  made to vomit from foreign object down the throat  staplespinsetc to the genit area googl and i are not go to be friend for the rest of the even delet dontgoogleitdontgoogleitdontgoogleitdontgoogleitdontgoogleitdontgoogleitdontgoogleitdontgoogleitohmygoddontgoogleit i dont care how much they ask i would not explain this to a 5 year old  i would think so prolaps show a distinct failur of the pelvic floor muscl that provid support for your pelvic organ and viscera and it usual requir extens surgeri to fix everyth use of mesh well place perman sutur etc if your organ are liter fall out you have problem delet i onc had sexual relat with a larg male anal and had a prolaps anus i sort of just push it back in and it stay sore for a few day but then everyth was back to normal so in this case it was not damag perman no it not safe especi not anal as it can caus perman damag sinc it wasnt made to have foot long appendag thrust in there if you get to crazi you can perman damag your anus and then you will either face surgeri or rectal leakag and bleed  tldr do crazi shit to your anus and your anus will do crazi shit to you rectum damn near kill him im afraid to googl it so what is prolaps porn they probabl are caus some trauma but almost everi job doe pro athlet damag their bodi daili for a paycheck even as i type at my work arthriti and carpal tunnel develop though prolaps your bhole most like come with some psycholog damag as well delet delet delet prolaps isnt a veri serious condit most of the time rectal prolaps especi as it would take a lot to get to the point where intervent beyond just push it back in is necessari if there is damag done that are is vascular and somewhat design for damag so heal is quick and complet unless your talk a total sever of the passag but that not go to happen on accid  i tend to think of other peopl as if they are a prolaps of myself til prolaps pornographi exist   oh god whi  what is prolaps porn i dont wanna googl it theyr alreadi emot damag so whi not add physic damag to the mix  delet obvious it not especi safe but assum that noth is torn i dont think so   id liken it to stretch if over time you bend down with lock knee and tri to touch your toe your muscl and tendon and ligament will loosen and youll becom more flexibl but if you stop theyll tighten up again   gtone would assum that if a perform had a prolaps  this is to my mind mislead it make it sound like they alway have a prolaps that they walk around with this floppi red thing hang out of their ass but they dont they prolaps by bear down and general when they relax it return within them onli in the most extrem case as far as porn is concernedand im doubt that ani of the girl actual experi this have perform extens research on the matter do they have to manual reinsert the thing and then it seem to stay in place and that in a thorough warmedup ass normal it would be tighter read this while eat

 she had state that aspburg is no longer a thing  it isnt in the new giant diagnost handbook releas by the apa dsm is what it is call i think  autism is now a spectrum and peopl are now diagnos as have mild autism  of cours i may be rememb what she told me incorrect so pleas correct me if i wrong   my question for you is has your doctor chang his diagnosi to reflect this or doe the practic psycholog communiti onli appli the new definit to newli diagnos patient  also as someon who had the development disabl do you think it is funni when peopl pronounc it ass burger tldr we accept the love we think we deserv pick up chick in a fat suit   httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvx7payhmokka in other word just settl for less  not good advic i realli feel the word should be spell assburg doesnt he know women at all no mean yes when your tri to listen to someth quiet there are chang within your inner ear occur you have three littl bone in your ear call ossicl the malleus incus and stape which are flex by sound wave come into your ear these sit against the oval window which connect to a tube fill with fluid call the cochlea which is where your hear receptor are when you are tri to hear someth quiet the inner ear muscl around these ossicl can flex and move them closer to the oval window make it essenti more sensit to sound as it will deflect the membran more easili   there are also chang in your central nervous system where the brain will make your effer nerv fiber which conduct the sound you hear to the brain when these are depolar by the sound wave come in rather complic system id rather not get into unless you want me to you will hear nois so the brain can rais the threshold for these cell to depolar more easili when a nois is heard which will fire an action potenti and thus tell your brain your hear someth   these two system do the opposit when you are around loud nois to desensit the system too pretti neat    sourc neurophysiolog phd student   the differ has more to do what your brain is do than your ear ear drum etc you are more focus on the sound block out ani compet inform that would otherwis interfer by use select attent i dont have ani articl on this handi but if youd like more inform about attent id look for articl from broadbent moray treisman and lavi  lavi model is the most current and comprehens understand of attent that we have so far a lot of the research is done use visual percept as oppos to auditori but the way in which attent is understood is larg similar for both of them  sourc cogntiv psychologist say you are tri to focus on a weak voic in a factori there is a lot of nois present and the middl low part of the spectrum is realli satur even the best comput will be virtual unabl to detect ani human voic in this cacophoni by mere logic  but we could theoret teach it by cross referenc the sound with other sound depict parallel scene and point out care what frequenc present are the most import to singl out a voic effect mark the human voic spectrum with red paint in the middl of all the nois then compar the amplitud to when the voic is not present the comput could make an approxim of what is human voic and what is factori sound but there would be lot and lot of error where we are today with our technolog find softwar that doe these kind of nois reduct that work somewhat better than older softwar is alway mind blow for me  the human brain work in the same way our ear are just convert just as comput have signal convert analogtodigit translat the air pressur into signal your brain can interpret as such the inform your brain get is alway nois  you alway hear everyth howev when you tri to concentr on the voic your are retriev inform about how a voic is built harmon and rhythmic inform from speech pattern and so on thus tri to find what frequenc that fit in to the pattern that are somewhat louder your languag skill which is more or less complex music knowledg will then fill in the gap the best it can result in that you might not hear everi word but you will guess it  say now that you want to singl out the sound of a hypothet machin in the factori you have no prior knowledg of you will absolut no chanc of do it if you dont walk close to the machin and start to use the close to amplifi it sound for your ear  it the same in silent situat realli but you have the problem now that the signal is so low that your ear will have a hard time make out differ even though there might be silenc around the sound sourc i dont know but it could have someth to do with how we perceiv the spectrum with an exponenti bias make too subtl chang hard to detect  but this could just be pseudoscientif stuff ive been fed with in ani case your mind is tri to creat a sound object it can identifi and if it has alreadi identifi the object you can switch your attent to recogn it  thus make you perceiv it louder  sourc compos train in sonolog not scienc but i hope my rambl can make thing graspabl in some way one aspect is that when your tri to hear someth specif you aim your ear at it by turn your head  you might even put your hand up to your ear to deflect other sound  of cours the other answer are relev too  this is just one aspect of the process you may be do someth visibl and physic that your not alway awar of  turn so you can hear the nois better or cup your hand over your ear to focus more of the sound your tri to pick up  other speci like your favorit housecat can do this without their hand of cours  they can use their ear to focus on one or more sound and even cover their ear to protect from loud nois or the
