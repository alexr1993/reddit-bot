Queens of the Stone Age - You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire [California, Alternative Metal/Stoner Rock. 2002](/r/Music)




    |*Songs For The Deaf* is such a perfect album.


        |Top notch album. Not a skip worthy track on this record. This is one of those records you have to play in order because
        |the whole thing flows so well. 


            |So you would advise people to just Go With the Flow?


                |And after listening to the full album you feel the urge to Do It Again


                    |Sometimes I skip a track, but No One Knows.


                        |I was Gonna Leave You guys to continue this thread alone, but I just had to step in


                            |I never came.


                                |I don't even try, why would I?


                            |Gonna Leave You* 


                                |Ha. Right. I forgot that song was more decisive than that


                            |You guys should watch out, the sky is fallin'.


                                |A song for that deaf. That is for you, my friend. 


                                    |If you guys keep this shit up I'll have to put you on the Hangin' Tree.


                                        |All of this makes me want to listen to an Actual song for the deaf..


                                        |Then there might be some mosquitoes on our bodies


                                            |Boooooooo!


                        |[deleted]


                            |Wrong album, overall poor attempt.


                            |The bandwagon is fucking each other now?


                |If you do *Everyone's Gonna Be Happy* 


                |When that album comes through the hi-fi, you'd swear God is in the Radio.


            |meh, Six Shooter is a pretty imperfect song, but otherwise, amazing album.


                |Dude! Six Shooter is SO good. ////I may be mistaken here, but I believe I read an interview with Josh back when
                |SFTD came out, where he called Six Shooter -- and songs similar to it, like Quick and to the Pointless -- "smar
                | bombs." ////you throw a raucous piece of screaming punk in the mix between a bunch of tight, well-polished tra
                |ks and it EXPLODES. ////In a very, very good way. 


                    |Yeah but the song has to be good. Quick and to the Pointless is great! Six Shooter is just a bit...meh. It'
                    | the only song on the album that isn't great though.


            |Hah, I really wish this record were affordable.


        |First album I've ever heard from them, still my favorite. I mean Dave Grohl on drums? Doesn't get better than that


        |I just saw them in Atlanta for the Music Midtown fest. They fucking KILLED this song.


            |As did I. Stood in the mud for 45 minutes beforehand to get a good spot and missed out on the Yeah Yeah Yeahs but i
            | was totally worth it.


        |The new album is fantastic, too. If not equals in quality, it's close.


            |This and ...Like Clockwork are the only QOTSA albums I have with every song synced to the ipod


                |I can listen to Lullabies and RatedR without skipping too. Especially Lullabies, such a cool record. But I love
                |every record. ////Gosh I'm such a fanboy.


        |Every song on the album is incredible, plus the radio parodies they have on some of the songs are hilarious. 


            |Dave Ketching here. It's been a good night. Not sayin' good night, just sayin'.


                |I NEED A SAGA.


            |I'd listen to a forthewolfx album


            |[OMG ITS FORTHEWOLFX](http://i.imgur.com/QUEOaUp.png)


        |I feel like a thousand bucks but my bank account says $259.45


        |It's got two of the best intense running songs ever--this, and Go with the Flow


        |Awesome music, but shoving their studio in jokes beween songs like that was pretty self indulgent.


        |LMAO////////////////////check out this pleb!


        |at least their honest withe title because you have to actually be deaf to enjoy their music


            |You even downvoted yourself for that.


    |First time I heard this song I was in 6th grade playing Jak X Combat Racing. In college now and it's still in my top 10 fav
    |rite albums, I fucking love me some QOTSA


        |Gimme QOTSA, gimme some more.


    |K-L-O-N Los Angeles. Klon radio. We play the songs that sound more like everyone else, then anyone else. *Klon* Hey alright
    |its kip casper. Klon radio: LA's infinite repeat. How we feeling out there? How's your drive time commute? I need a saga. W
    |at's the saga? Its songs for the deaf. You can't even hear it!


        |ALL DEATH METAL, ALL THE TIME////^^^^ALL ^^^^THE ^^^^TIME


            |I whisper along every goddamn time.


                |You whisper along *all the time*.


            |*all the time*


        |I'm not saying good night... Just saying, goodnight


            |Here is something you should drop to your knees for, and worship. But you are too stupid to realise yourselves. A s
            |ng for the deaf. That is for you.


                |Millionaire...Queens of the Stone Age...a song about something that will never be *huhuhahahuh*


                    |Hallelujah all, i wanna hear a couple of of hallelujahs.


                    |&gt;We play the songs that sound more like everyone else, then anyone else.////Love that line


        |I can hear the music coming in when I read that... I've listened to the album so many times. I think I'll pop it on now
        |while I read.


        |Right away Dave started pounding away in my head


        |I thought they said "Hell is infinite... repeat." Instead of LA's infinite repeat. 


    |I always love watching this performance of the song.////Live at Rock AM Ring (2003) w/Nick Oliveri on vocals////http://www.
    |outube.com/watch?v=SMd6CcX7yPA


        |I've been at that specific show, it was great. I don't know the exact order anymore, but Deftones and Zwan were also be
        |ore or after QOTSA. Best three shows of the weekend. Especially Deftones.


    |Here's the original pre-queens desert sessions version: http://youtu.be/QBwilpyz-aI//


    |This is one of the best album openers I've heard before.


    |BTW for anyone who enjoys this but hasn't heard Kyuss, you will definitely want to check them out. Josh Homme's pre-QOTSA b
    |nd. The definition of desert/stoner rock. Heavy as fuck. He played his guitar through a bass amp to achieve this insane ton
    |. You can't go wrong with any track on *Welcome to Sky Valley* or *Blues For the Red Sun*.////KYUSS.


    |Originally a Desert Sessions song!////http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzxVJQJG7hM////I must say, I'm quite partial to the QO
    |SA version however.


    |Goddamn I love QOTSA. 


        |Once Josh Homme stomped on Jay Z's ego, they can do no wrong in my book.


    |Seeing these twice in November. Cannot wait.


        |Pretty sure Australia is getting an announcement this week for a coheadline tour of QOTSA and Nine Inch Nails - very ov
        |rdue seeing on both accounts, so I am pretty hopeful. 


            |Man, QOTSA and NIN? You're in for a treat.//


                |I saw QOTSA and NIN together on tour a few years ago. I love both dearly, although Queens is something I listen
                |to a lot more. Kinda sad but most of the crowd was there for NIN and they didn't show a lot of love for Queens.


                    |Really? I saw QOTSA open for NIN in Madison back in 2005, and the crowd loved Queens just as much as NIN. T
                    |ose are two bands that just go together so well, you'd expect a lot of crossover fans between them, but may
                    |e you just had a rough crowd.


                |QOTSA and NIN were supposed to come to Miami and then Katrina happened. I've been waiting to see them both at t
                |e same time ever since.


        |They fucking killed it in Atlanta a few weeks ago. Best concert of music midtown.////Homme knows what songs people want
        |and by god, he fucking gives it to you. In the best way possible.


            |I was front row fucking center for that show. My neck is still sore! Opened with this tune, closed with a perfectly
            |drawn out Song for the Dead


        |Same! Where?


            |I originally bought a ticket for Birmingham on the 21st, then I found out Band of Skulls are supporting them at Wem
            |ley on the 23rd. I'm also a big football fan so seeing QOTSA at Wembley kills two birds with one stone! ////Where a
            |e you seeing them man? 


                |O2 in Dublin on the 17th. I can't wait! 


    |Why didn't I hear of this earlier? It's so good!


    |This song is awesome, but Song For The Dead on that record is my fave.


    |[Check out the original version.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxkmILkS7Oo)////Makes one want to have some sex.


    |KYUSS


    |I am of the opinion that [this is the greatest music video ever made](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcHKOC64KnE). (go with
    |the flow)


    |My favorite QOTSA song. It's physically impossible to listen to this and not get amped up. It works so well as an opening t
    |ack too.


    |Anyone else seeing them in Nashville tomorrow?


        |Yessir


            |Hell yes. I'm gonna be grooving my ass off.


    |Super awesome song. I still love this intro track over "Feel Good Hit of the Summer."


    |I'm so happy to see QOTSA on the front page, absolutely great band.


    |Ok, this reminds me of "White Limo" from Foo Fighters' album Wasting Light. I love the harsh vocals. Can anyone suggest oth
    |r similar songs or bands?


        |The first Queens album is very heavy like this song. Also, fun fact, Foo Fighters recorded One by One after Dave Grohl 
        |ad been been playing in this band. You can hear obvious influences on the album, especially All My Life, and Low.


        |Every single song by this band. Get them all, you will fall in love. 


    |Saw them last night in Dallas. They played a damn good show. This song was played


        |Show was amazing. I was really excited to hear this, "In the Fade", "Misfit Love" and "Sick Sick Sick". 


        |Misfit Love 2nd song baby! Great show!!! 


            |FUCK. I GOT SICK AND COULDNT GO, BUT I DIDN'T THINK THEY'D PLAY MISFIT FUCKING LOVE, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A LIKE C
            |OCKWORK SHOW. GOD FUCKING DAMN IT.


    |This was the second song they performed at ACL, and to see people not know the pause was exhilarating. 


        |Yes! They were awesome at ACL. I haven't heard much of their music honestly, but it was such a great show.


            |Very much. Had to leave early for Muse. They were magnificent.


    |Oh man this song got me into QotSA. Tony Hawk's Underground had SUCH a good soundtrack. 


    |Can't believe no one mentioned how awesome this track was for the Battlefield Bad company 2 trailer! The song is fucking aw
    |some! Just made me want the game so much more!////[Link to trail (If you haven't seen it, it's worth a watch!)](http://www.
    |outube.com/watch?v=gApu9Xa3dgw)


        |That trailer is the only place I remember this song from!


    |I didn't think I would ever see a Queens of thr Stone Age video say it was blocked in my country :(


    |Got my tickets the other day to see them in December.


    |Blocked in Canada 


    |oh my god i love this song with all my heart im glad someone posted this here


    |[this](http://vimeo.com/27867894#t=1m33s)////qosta+terje=&lt;3


    |why did you tag it with the word california?


        |because they're from california, and the song was likely produced there


            |Palm Desert, specifically, a place most people have never heard of (near Palm Springs if you know where that is.) I
            |live in PD, this place sucks, but there are a few awesome things here, like QOTSA and Kyuss being from here.


    |Just saw them live in Dallas last night.  Amazing.


    |Songs for the Deaf is the album that got huge commercially, but I have trouble picking it over Lullabies to Paralyze. Every
    |hing QotSA does they do best on that album. If you haven't listened to it, go do so.


        |I love all their albums, but Rated R would be at the top of my list.


        |While Lullabies and Songs for the Deaf are both phenomenal albums, the new one has overtaken them as my favourite. Ever
        | single track is stellar from beginning to end. 


            |It grows on me more everyday. Just picked it up on vinyl yesterday, actually.


                |The first time I heard it, I admit I felt disappointed. It just had a completely different feel to it. Then I l
                |stened again and I was completely hooked. What a fantastic album. Easily the most depth of any QoTSA record. 


                    |I feel the exact same way


    |Seeing them next month in Belfast, dammit I can't wait.


    |I don't really listen to anything with screaming at all, for me it usually takes away from the song. This song just manages
    |to tick all the right boxes though, the vocals just sound like another instrument or something


    |I can remember, as an angsty youth, driving though a retirement village with this cranked all the way up. Got some funny lo
    |ks. Good times.


    |songs for the deaf is by far the best album released in the 2000's.


    |Listen to just the first song? *Nahhhh...guess my next hour and a half is planned out*


    |This is my go-to song after a particularly stressful day at work. Walk out the door, headphones in, volume full, go. ////Pe
    |fect. 


    |Desert Rock is the preferred nomenclature. 


    |If you like qotsa, you should check out another of homme's bands eagles of death metal. They are equally amazing.


        |And Them Crooked Vultures. Homme, Grohl, and John Paul Jones.


            |Absolutely. Another perfect album. As if Grohl and Homme didn't already form an amazing super-group, they throw in 
            |he bass player from led fucking zeppelin to boot. 


    |i get alot of hate from my friends saying theire newest 2 albums just aren't my thing. theres a couple ok tunes on them. bu
    | when i hear the first 4 (not counting beaver) i think man, what a fucking amazing album every song pretty much was great. 


    |Oh man, not only JAK-X, but Bad Company 2 ingrained this song in my head for life////http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gApu9Xa
    |dgw


    |One of the few albums that you have to listen to all in one go. Feels like a complete work.


    |Saw them at Midtown! My favorites. 


    |I really like the tune, but I have to ask: what in the name of Hastur is "toro" supposed to mean? ////I mean, I know that i
    | is Spanish or Italian for "bull"; but I don't think that they are asking to "give them bulls, give them some more"...


    |Saw them live in Ireland around 2003 I think, backing up rhcp. They opened with this, it blew my 15 year old mind. 


    |It's a queens kinda day.


    |I miss Nick so much. I'm still a die-hard QoTSA fan, and Josh Homme is my god, but Nick brought so much to that bad. They r
    |ally have't been the same since his departure. 


    |FORTIFIED WITH THE LIQUOR STORE!


    |Does anyone else think that Dave Grohl adds a golden touch onto an already great band? 


    |This is straight up Rock'N'Roll.  I wouldn't call it Alt metal in any capacity.  ////That being said, I hope Nick keeps his
    |shit semi-sane so they have a good crack at touring with the "true" lineup.


    |Upvoting this rare gem


    |Goddamn this made my laundry day go so swell. Thanks!


    |what's up with the stupid tags on this?

            |A bold move.


                |A bold move, Cotton. Let's see if it plays out 


    |Stoner rock... Wtf?


        |Have you ever listened to any of their albums stoned? They have super groove-based repetitive riffs, dreamy vocals, and
        |weird sound effects. It's pretty stoner-rock I'd say. Not so much this song, though.

        |ge, Nick Oliveri, Josh Homme. They made it what it is today.////Obviously others influenced it too.


            |Don't forget Brant Bjork!


                |did he work on SftD?


            |Ya, but the wiki is wrong. It's a separate genre. 


        |Originally desert rock, changed to stoner rock by the label to appeal to stoners


            |no label ever called queens stoner rock


                |I meant stoner rock wasn't really what the bands themselves called it


                    |The other bands didn't have a problem with it, just queens. And even then it was more the fans than the rec
                    |rd labels describing it as such.


        |Robot rock, a term coined by le Homme himself, actually describes this music really well.


            |Sorry Joshie, but your term was [co-opted](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=w

        |I would imagine listening to this album stoned would be fucking terrifying. Mosquito Song? Yick. They're behind my eyes


            |Uh.. weed shouldn't make you trip like that.


                |you aint smokin the right weed son


    |This song always reminds me of xXx


        |This song always reminds me of [CKY](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1gtx9e_L7c)


        |The hardest movie to find with search engine.


    |This is the last album where qotsa still had balls and rocked out. Ever since nick was kicked out they've been more and mor
    | mainstream and this last album albeit still good in terms of modern rock doesn't do songs for the deaf or rated r/qotsa an
    | justice. Qusta are one of my favorite bands and I saw them at lolla this year but when they opened with millionaire it was
    |sad to see Josh sing nicks song. I love em but the Queens are now just the Queens they've lost  their stone age edge. Homme
    |is a fantastic musician but joey and nick deserved more respect than he gave them. /////Jmo.


        |this so much. i miss the non-poppy- like songs like they did on their self-titeled :(


        |Dude your gonna get downvoted to hell but I almost completely agree. The new cd is good and I even liked lullabies a sh
        |t load but they seem to have lost there anger in there songs. Call it more mainstream if you want I just think they los
        | alot of there balls. But like I said I still fucking love them. 


        |What in the world about, Lullabies, Era Vulgaris or Like Clockwork is more mainstream?  Those are far darker and less a
        |proachable than anything off of SFTD&gt; 


            |I'm not saying the last three albums are bad one of my fav songs by qotsa is on lullabies, blood is love,  I just t
            |ink the songs were more rock n roll balls to the wall up to sftd. Oliveri was basically half the band in terms of  
            |ongwriting.  It changed the whole dynamic. You don't have to agree with me but qotsa was not the same band after ni
            |k left. //And I guess mainstream was the wrong adjective to use.  I wrote this on my phone while watching the Bears
            |lose. XD

    |"Stoner Rock" &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;


        |I said the same thing. I hope that name does not catch on for any genre. 


            |[You're like 15 years too late.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner_rock)


    |Just because Kyuss and Screaming Trees were "stoner rock" if you want to call it that, doesn't mean everything Josh Homme e
    |er touched was. Queens of the Stone Age definitely weren't; they were just generic alternative rock.


        |they're not "were" in the past tense as if theyre no longer making music, they just release Like Clockwork and its anyt
        |ing but generic alt rock.


        |I was only going by the categorization they used on the Wiki page for the album. And by that definition, Stoner Rock "c
        |mbines elements of traditional heavy metal, psychedelic rock, blues rock, acid rock, and doom metal" and is "typically 
        |low-to-mid tempo and features a bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and "retro" production"////I think that definition de
        |initely fits this song, and a lot of their earlier stuff in general.


        |&gt; Queens of the Stone Age definitely weren't////And to be more specific, this song definitely isn't anything like "s
        |oner rock".


            |I love me some Queens of the Stone Age but they are probably one of the last things I'd put on after smoking a doob
            | Driving music, yes!. Stoner? No. 


                |Queens of the stone age is actually fantastic while high.


                |I refer to them as this old thing called Rock n' Roll.


        |When you have a song that is literally nothing but a list of drugs, I'm pretty sure you can call your band 'stoner rock
        |' Not to mention iTunes organizes them under 'stoner rock.'


            |When a song's contents is limited to simply listing drugs, I'd label it a shallow grasp at relevance with the 12-21
            |crowd. Not surprisingly, that's about where Homme was at when they started this band, career-wise.////I guess "ston
            |r rock" works for you and Apple, though. To each their own.


                |iTunes: the authority.////Fucking nerds. 


                |I mean, I'm a stoner and I like listening to QOTSA. If the shoe fits...


                    |I'm a stoner and I like Elton John. What's your point?


                        |My point is they have a classification applied by more than one person and it makes sense because of th

                            |musical genres were classified. If this is the case, approximately 85% of all music made after 1950

            |Do you hear that music. 


    |Not sure why this got "tagged" as Stoner Rock.  Don't have to be a piece of shit to love these guys.  Downvote me if you lo

        |Can confirm, love thick shaft in my mouth.


        |Gotta love the double whammy of being close minded as well as a homophobe. Keep up the good work buddy.

        |Well guys, just in case you want to know, Josh Homme has said that he [dislikes the label stoner rock](http://thefade.n
        |t/oldsite/articles/jam991124.html)""If I had a choice, I would take that away," Homme says. "Stoner rock, to me, is lik
        | saying the crucial element is drugs. And I don't believe that that's the case. I'm not an AA guy or anything, but at t
        |e same time I don't need any of that to make music."////But hey, downvote all you want because of anti-weed sentiments 
        |nd not bother thinking about what he's actually said. 


        |If you really wanted people to not downvote you, you would have said "Go ahead and downvote me." But You said "Downvote
        |me if you're gay" which makes me think you're just a fucking troll.


    |Dat Tony Hawk doe. :)


    |I wouldn't call them stoner metal, more like Robot Rock or Riff Rock.


    |Going to see these guys in November. Hope they play some old songs, I mean Like Clockwork is good and all but this particul
    |r album is pure gold.


    |I just saw this band play last night.... it was amazeballs. Hearing both old &amp; new songs :D
