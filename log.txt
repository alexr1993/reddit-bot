TIFU by sneezing while driving(/r/Today I Fucked Up)




    |Happened to a friend of mine in high school. He was driving on a two-lane road, suddenly and violently sneezed, crossed the
    |double-yellow center-line and crashed head-on into a mid 60ish lady driving the other way. She was killed instantly.////He 
    |as fortunate (in a manner of speaking), as her only relative was an estranged son in prison in another state, so he wasn't 
    |ued for wrongful death. He got a ticket, but other than that, no charges. I know it really affected him though...he wouldn'
    | talk about it for years.


        |Jesus, that's just horrific.


        |That's just insane how fast that kid's life went from sneezing to accidentally killing a senior citizen. It's terrifyin
        |.


        |[deleted]


            |Probably for not controlling his vehicle and killing somebody.


                |Ohh. 


                |weird how that works huh 


                |Through no fault of his own, sure you can hold a sneeze in sometimes, but other times they sneak on you 


                    |I agree that sometimes they sneak up on you, but I don't know that I'd go so far as to say it's absolutely 
                    |ot his fault. Maybe because I've never had a sneeze that caused unrelated parts of my body to flail so much
                    |I would move my car into oncoming traffic, but to me that sounds really extreme.


                        |I guess you would be told to pull over on the hard shoulder, sneeze and then carry on, or at least make
                        |sure it's safe to sneeze ////It would be hard to tell the cops or insurance companies "I crashed my car
                        |into that car because I sneezed." ////


                            |Sometimes you don't have time to pull over though. :/


                                |True that. I just hope im not driving/in a car with someone when a sneeze goes off 


                                    |Yea I've never even considered a situation like this before. While violent sneezes with inv
                                    |luntary arm movements are usually pretty rare, the fact that it's possible at all is a bit 
                                    |cary to think about.


                            |Actually here in the UK there are provisions for crashing whilst sneezing, as it comes under an "Ac
                            | of God" along with other circumstances that we cannot control. ////Insurers will still pay out for
                            |damage and the police don't issue penalties provided there is no reason to believe speeding, danger
                            |us driving or lack of attention was involved.


                    |If you sneeze it is entirely your fault. If you don't think you can control the car while sneezing, pull ov
                    |r and/or slow down beforehand.


        |So, in your country some lives are valued differently to others? So as long as their only relatives are estranged its f
        |ne to go killing people? Really?


            |I feel like they meant her only relative wasn't in a position to press charges, so their friend walked away with a 
            |icket instead of a lawsuit. To me it didn't sound like they devalued her life.


                |Not sure I get this, why is it down to the relatives to press charges? Doesn't the state have a role to play. Y
                |u know, "causing death by careless driving" manslaughter etc. in my country if you kill someone, sure you may g
                |t less if it was not deliberate etc, but the prosecution will be by the state and you will find yourself facing
                |at least manslaughter charges. A person dies, you don't just get a ticket. 


                    |I don't think he was careless.  He sneezed... Accidents happen, regardless of how hard we try to be safe, e
                    |pecially on the road which is inherently dangerous.  It would be different if he was out for a joy ride or 
                    |runk.  People shouldn't be harshly punished for something outside their control.


                        |I'm not saying he should be harshly punished, I'm questioning why it should be down to relatives to bri
                        |g charges.


                            |Relatives don't bring charges, they take you to civil court in order to get money.


                                |I thought that was what the drivers car insurance was for. Sorry, I'm just trying to relate thi
                                | to what I'm used to in Britain. Why should relatives have to sue anybody? Don't insurance comp
                                |nies pay out? 


                                    |They usually won't pay a lot. And maybe the driver wasn't insured. Or maybe the insurance c
                                    |mpany decided to fuck up its investigation (happened to a friend of mine insurance company 
                                    |aid he ran a red light when, in actuality, the person who hit him ran a red). There are a t
                                    |n of reasons why you would get little to no money to cover your medical/funeral bills. Whic
                                    | is why the US ends up being a little sue happy.


                    |I don't know anything about the incident/case other than what was posted, if he was charged and got off or 
                    |ust got a ticket or what. I hope a state would pursue manslaughter, but I don't know the law well enough to
                    |discuss it beyond "killing people will probably cause you legal trouble" honestly.


            |The state chose not to press charges, so his only liability was civil, and as there was no family in a position to 
            |ue, his only financial or legal liability was the ticket.////I didn't intend to devalue the life of the woman who w
            |s killed in the accident, nor should anything I wrote be taken that way.


    |This is one of my biggest fears!! I'm sorry it happened to you. :/


        |The worst is sneezing inside a full face helmet on a motorbike! Not only are you struck with fear from sneezing while m
        |ving, but you now have to clean your visor as well. 


            |I think I've mastered the art of sneezing with my eyes open on my bike. Shooting snot rockets all over my chin bar.
            |.not so much.


                |It's actually physically impossible to sneeze with your eyes open.

                    |No, it isn't. I can do it too.


                        |Is it true that your eyes can pop out from the force of the sneeze? 


                            |No.


                                |God damn myths.


                    |it definitely isn't


                    |Dude, goddamn Mythbusters did it.


            |What about sneezing inside your full face helmet while skydiving? 


        |[deleted]


            |Are you Satan? Why would you put that image in my head!


            |Every time I go fishing I think of that hook catching me somehow. 


        |I sneezed while making a left turn today... I thought I was going to die... I'm a bit paranoid about that too.


    |Damn! Hope you're OK. Did you have insurance for the car?////I used to get sneezing fits for a time after I had surgery on 
    |y sinuses. I would feel it coming on, and I had to pull over on the side of the road so I didn't wreck my car. ////Pro Tip:
    |If you feel a sneeze coming at a bad time, press your tongue against the roof of your mouth, just behind your top front tee
    |h. It helps fight off the sneeze.


        |Also rubbing directly upward on your forehead.  It's an old Samurai trick.//////Alternatively you can hold a tissue in 
        |ront of your mouth and when you involuntarily inhale for the sneeze you'll suck the tissue in and tissue on the tongue 
        |s upsetting enough to short-circuit the sneeze so you only have to deal with the chaos now in your mouth.


            |OP's next post: "TIFU by choking on tissue."

                                |I believe what you meant to say was////Head on apply directly to the forehead.


        |I found that pressing a finger directly up under the bottom of my nose (between the nostrils) will kill the sneeze.


            |Or, similarly, put your finger up to your face as if giving yourself a Hitler 'stache, and press against your teeth


                |yeah, that works as well.////JUST DON'T LOOK AT THE LIGHT


            |If you lift your upper lip and look in the mirror, you will see two rather large arteries that deliver oxygen rich 
            |lood to your sinus area.  Pressing your finger under your nose in that position interrupts the blood flow and that 
            |s why it helps prevent sneezing.  You actually have to press though, don't just rest your finger under your nose li
            |e you see in comedies.


    |Oh god! You aren't hurt are you?

    |Sue mother earth for making allergies a thing and almost killing you


    |Sorry to hear that. As someone with severe allergies, I've learned to always lock my arms TIGHT when I feel a sneeze coming
    |on, wait as long as possible before actually sneezing, and make my head take all the movement. 


        |Somehow I've learned to sneeze in a very minor way. It's barely more than a bump anymore. I am seriously averse to the 
        |ound of sneezing so that probably motivated it, but it is possible to control how hard you sneeze. 


        |As long as you're not turning, you might actually be better off letting go of the wheel while you sneeze.  It's not inh
        |rently dangerous to do so.


            |Not with the roads around here. Bumps and shit make the car veer. Maybe I need an alignment.


            |That depends on the state of the road, the current alignment state of the tires, and a certain forgiveness from a p
            |rverse universe. 


                |It does entirely.


            |Good luck with that if you live in Norway. We have the worst roads in all of Europe I'm sure.


                |Yeah, it's not a good idea on rough roads.  I guess I was referring mostly to major, well-maintained highways.


    |When I was taking my drivers ed course felt a sneeze coming on. "WhatdoIdowhatdoIdowhatdoIaaachoooo". Nothing happened, the
    |instructor assured me nothing would the next time I sneezed behind the wheel.  You have confirmed my 15 year old self's big
    |est fear.  I never get rapid fire sneezes though, I hope you're not too injured.


    |Makes me glad I'm not one of those people who go "ACHOO-ACHOO-ACHOO-ACHOO-ACHOO!" every time I sneeze.


        |I sneeze at least 3 or 4 times.  Every time. :(


            |So does my husband.  3-5.


            |Achoo-achoo! Achoo! (5 seconds pass) ACHOO! Okay, I'm done.////Every time.


        |I used to do that. But I figured out you don't need to sneeze so loudly to sneeze. 


    |That's awful, hope you're ok.////As an aside, and for future ref - the way to stop yourself sneezing is to ram your tongue 
    |nto the roof of your mouth hard and hold it there until the feeling passes.  It's a trick a soldier told me (you don't want
    |to give away your position by honking a giant sneeze out).  It really works - I use it all the time.


    |I guess this is the one benefit of having allergies that never go away, I can magically survive driving sneezures.  


    |ITT:  People who don't know how to hold in sneezes.


        |ITT: People who can't sneeze without wildly flailing their arms


            |... even while they're driving, when they should be very conscious of it.


    |Oh god, that's such a fear.////You ok?


    |Tip - If you're driving on a straight road and about to sneeze... hover hand the steering wheel.


        |doesn't work if your car pulls


            |Tip - take care of your vehicle.


                |It has as much to do with the road as it does your car. Crowning and whatnot. 


    |I always slow down some when u sneeze. I can always feel it coming to so I can get ready when I'm driving. 


    |**Protip**: Open your mouth, and let the sneeze out that way.


    |It's because no one read around to say bless you. That's what happens


    |Someone rear-ended my cousin's car (while u was in the passenger seat) because she claimed she sneezed and thought she saw 
    |he light turn green. ////Honestly, she hit too hard to have been stopped behind us and then hit he gas that hard. I feel li
    |e she just didn't stop in time and blamed the sneeze. ////Thought it was ridiculous at the time, but I guess it really does
    |happen. 


    |Foot over brake, hands off wheel. (Or hold loosely.)


        |Just hold on loosely, but don't let go. If you cling too tightly you're gonna lose control.


    |This happened to my friend the other week, she sneezed and rear ended a car. Sneezing while driving is frightning.


    |Next time you're about to sneeze anywhere and don't want to, Mouth the word Pineapple, You don't have to say it, just move 
    |our lips accordingly. The sneeze will go away in my experience about 95% of the time.//


    |Pictures?


        |Send photo. 


    |My biggest fear during allergy season. 


    |I once got into a minor car accident (only my car was involved, really wasn't that bad. I spun out and the right side of my
    |car hit the left street barrier to scratch and dent it up) in my parents car and I blamed it happening due to me sneezing. 
    |ruth be told, I was just going faster than I should have been going into a turn and I didn't actually sneeze.////Sorry to h
    |ar it happened to you :(


    |That is my fear every time I start sneezing in the car, as I can never seem to just sneeze one flipping time, NO I have to 
    |ave a 5 minute sneezing session. And I swear my body is trying to kill me as it loves to happen about time I'm going into a
    |curve. 


    |As someone who can sneeze 20 times in a row like it ain't no thang, I'm even more scared of driving than I was before. 


    |Whenever I sneeze whilst driving, I have the exact same fear


    |I sneezed during rush hour traffic and rear ended someone a few years ago. I felt like an idiot telling my family. My uncle
    |even thought I was trying to cover for doing something. Nope, sneezed and missed my breaks.


    |That sucks, and not in a good way.////That's like, as bad as having a seizure.  


    |Factotum reference.


    |One of my worst fears,  and I sneeze a lot.  I'm pretty sure this will happen to me 


    |At my 15 year class reunion, I found out we had lost a class mate and they said he sneezed while driving and rear ended a s
    |mi. 


    |protip: let go of the steering wheel! It seems counter-intuitive but it will automatically assume the straight forward posi
    |ion allowing you to sneeze into your hands all you like.


    |I had a sneeze last week that was a continual 4 or 5 sneezes and it left me winded afterward. I'm glad I wasn't driving.


    |Sorry man that sucks,I'm always scared that will happen but I re assure myself that never happens. Thanks OP for confirming
    |my fear.I'm gonna pull over next time I have to sneeze.


    |They'll probably ban sneezing while driving. That can be dangerous.


    |You know I sneezed why driving once and thought of this same scenario and boom here it is.


    |In all seriousness, I have had to pull the car into the breakdown lane to sneeze before. Once I came to a dead stop in the 
    |iddle of the road because of it.


    |Just keep your eyes open when you sneeze buster brown... Skin


    |I was expecting "i sneezed and shit myself" or "i was going commando, sneezed and period everywhere" mildly disappointed


    |What the fuck? How is this even possible? Pics or it didn't happen.


    |I'm always terrified when I have to sneeze when I'm driving...


    |If you can't control a 2000lb vehicle at 60mph through a sneeze, you should not have a license. You are lucky you didn't ki
    |l anyone. Please don't get behind the wheel again.


        |Some people just have incredibly violent sneezes. It's not something you can control. It doesn't have anything to do wi
        |h your driving ability. 


            |I sneeze 5-7 times at a shot while driving at least once a week. I have sensitive sinuses and my sneezes make peopl
            | jump across the room and bend me over, they're not minimal. But I've never made one mistake from sneezing when beh
            |nd the wheel.


            |If sneezing inhibits your ability to drive, it does relate to your driving ability.  I wouldn't get in a car with a
            |driver that was liable to crash after sneezing.


        |You're driving at 100 km/h, which means your vehicle covers ~28m/s. Let's say that a sneeze disorients you for 2 second
        |. That's 56m in 2 seconds, and a lot can happen in that much space while you're driving. People sneeze, we're all human
        | That doesn't mean we shouldn't be allowed to drive. This person sneezed 5 times, greatly increasing the odds of losing
        |control of the vehicle. What do you want them to do, pull over on the highway while sneezing? You're acting as if you h
        |ve complete control over your vehicle while you sneeze.


        |Five*


        |Five sneezes according to OP, and when you sneeze your eyes involuntarily close; it can't be prevented.////I've been re
        |r-ended by people who've had way more asinine excuses than "I was in the middle of a sneezing fit".


    |Did the airbag help? Or did you set it off and that's what caused you to crash?


    |This is probably my greatest fears while driving. Not your fault, OP. 


    |haha women drivers :)


    |I want to know why this sort of thing was not thought of when cars were first being designed. Even at the slow speeds they 
    |ad back then it was rather dangerous. 


        |[deleted]


            |They didn't always have seabelts back then. In fact they were not required to be installed until the 1960's.


        |What exactly would you be able to do about it?
