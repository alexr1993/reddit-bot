Finds references made about popular threads

We have references people make in comments to posts either popular recently or
possibly a post which is famous/infamous in Reddit history. The first part of
this problem is finding the most simple references, i.e. those which can be 
linked using the title text, after that it will get weird with references to
images and references made using images.

To start off I am going to cheat by using references people have pointed out
already, perhaps by text or by posting that captain america "I get that refe-
rence" gif
