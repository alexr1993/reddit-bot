Japan promoting programs to produce more hackers for cybersecurity.(/r/Technology )




    |Hm, I feel like Japan is generally lacking in the "teaching stuff yourself" department (which so many Western "hackers" are
    |born in), mainly because most students have their days so filled up with school, club activities, homework, cram schools an
    | entrance exams, that there remains very little time to follow interests that lie outside the mainstream hobbies / club the
    |es.////On top of that, there's far less PC culture over there, mainly because entire generations use their phone for everyt
    |ing online. When you say "internet" over there, most people will think of a phone first; browsing the web on a PC is the ex
    |eption (at least that's how it felt to me 3 years ago).


        |I agree with this assessment, after living in Japan for two years myself.////* Phones are used way more than PCs are in
        |regards to the internet, and thus people's interest and usage of PCs is a lot lower. Phones are way more accessible.//*
        |Young people's time is filled with school work. Early education doesn't involve a lot of computer education, much less 
        |ncouraging "hacking".////This whittles the pool of potential candidates to a very small number. Good to see they've ack
        |owledged the problem in cyber-security, considering China, one of their regional rivals, dwarfs them in comparison in t
        |rms of numbers of tech-savvy hackers/security professionals.


            |It's a big security flaw, but I can't help but think that phone hacking will become the norm in 5-10 years time any
            |ay, so they might actually be ahead of the curve in that regard.  I just can't imagine everything being based on a 
            |hysical network in the future.  It seems far too insecure.  


                |You're going to see programs designed to crack phones, but they're going to be written on computers.


                    |For now maybe, in a decade, who knows?

            |Do you play any games? This really only applies to Windows, but I started "hacking" MMORPGs back when I was a teena

        |&gt; lacking in the "teaching stuff yourself" department ////This is common to most Asian-based culture and not just in
        |the ways you've explained, and it's not just the school taking up time. If you have a problem, people don't generally t

        |For comparison, the women-folk in western country appear far more independent than the normal city person male.////I ha
        |e a hypothesis as to why this situation exists in either places. In Asian countries, "human" is cheap. Not cheap in mon
        |tary terms, which also it is. But also in emotional terms. You help fix something for your friends and they don't have 
        |o get you a beer, or money or anything like that to "thank" you. If they do, it's considered as an insult... as if he's
        |'buying' you. You just did it because hey you're friends and that's what friends do. Likewise, when you have problems w
        |th something else (maybe your car or something like that) you can just drag him along and complain and bitch that he sh
        |uld try to fix it. No siree, he isn't getting off easy. He HAS to do it if he knows how to. You don't say no to friends
        | remember?////So, if you're going to have your problem solved in an abstracted way (i.e. calling a human solves your pr
        |blem), how would you even know that you're interested in something? It's like, if you don't *know* what x86 floating po
        |nt registers are, because your friend fixed it for you (for instance), how would you know that you're interested in vec
        |or math or writing assembly code? ////Also, you won't take active interest in searching for shit online except whatever
        |is culturally relevant to your time and location, like CS, Starcraft, Dota etc. You've never had to think about network
        |problems, so you don't know wireshark exists, and so your potential interest in wifi hacking hasn't taken off at all.//

                        |Also because Japanese apartments are small in most cities where people live so it's not worth owning a

                        |I know, but the point I was trying to make is it's easier to just do one design since if you design for
                        |mobile with simple text, it should translate and scale just as well to desktop, thus not spending money
                        |on a second design. 


                |The better question to ask is why not have a separate desktop site? ////And the answer is like why a lot of web
                |ites still don't have mobile sites in America, it's not worth it. 


            |There's also the fact that to (most of) our eyes, written Japanese just looks like noise since we can't understand

            |That website (http://www.rakuten.co.jp/) isn't a mobile friendly website at all. Try adjusting the borders, if it's

            | the top are way too small to be considered mobile friendly.


                |Try accessing it with your phone. It serves up a mobile friendly version.

                                |Comparing that company's English and Japanese sites, the Japanese one appears to provide more i
                                |formation (more sales, business practices, detailed sidebar) up front and suggests several item
                                | that someone might be interested in purchasing. The English one provides a single sale and a l

                        |Look at the English site for comparison. It looks much more modern. Maybe that is the style that they l

        |Why? Their target audience isn't complaining. They like it. It works. Everybody's happy.


        |Everyone knows this, except Japanese people. The thing is, Japanese internet users don't WANT better design. Yahoo trie

        |went crazy and revolted about it until they changed it back.////I read somewhere in a poll as well that Japanese people
        |actually preferred a cluttered, difficult to use design over more streamlined and user-friendly designs.


            |I know what you're talking about regarding Japanese web design, but it seems strange when this same culture has min

                    |i know you're joking, but [oh god it's minimal, and so beautiful.](http://i.imgur.com/CxoUZuv.jpg) 


                |because being minimalistic means tightly mapping the interface with the complexity of the system. If a systems

        |where X aspects and elements that make up A are just "naturally" better than these Y ones that make up B.////I'm starti
        |g to wonder this now. I've been aware to how people just accept what is normal to them to be the "correct" way, but I t
        |o really thought how web design in Japan is... on a different level, one behind the west. But thinking about this now, 
        |aybe there's far more too it, like the stuff I just said above. In fact I'm sure there is, as I'm having a bit of a nos
        |algic feeling right now, after having gotten used to these sites made with rather different philosophies it would seem 
        |nd having been living in Japan for 5 years now, remembering how I used to feel about such sites when I first started us
        |ng them. (I'm also sure it's a LOT easier to find what you want in what appears to be a sea of information when you can
        |flick through it all and recognise what you need in an instance, like I can naturally do in English yet no where near d
        | as well in Japanese and could absolutely not do at all 5 years ago. Try a wikipedia article for example.)


        |Japanese magazines and TV shows have that crowded look too. It's just a cultural thing I guess.


        |Good point there!  ////That is one of the main reasons why I started a web dev company in Japan specializing in clean l
        |oking designs that are also responsive for mobile users. ////When I first started out, it was just amazing how almost t
        |e entire nation was still on IE6 (Internet Explorer 6) and still using it. (For those who aren't designers, IE6 is just
        |a total nightmare for designers.) ////Not sure why that is but I have noticed that simple computer security protocols i
        |e. updating software just isn't a thing for many Japanese here esp. considering that most of the entire nation are oldi
        |s that are stubborn or just don't know how to update.////That also adds to the point that Japan being a graying nation 
        |s also another reason why Japan is having problems looking for young talented hackers TMO. High costs of living and cra
        |y working hours are taking away the essential love-making hours so that special talented someone is not born yet. It's 
        |ike in Civ5 when you have a declining population, you lose out getting an Einstein.////Last but not least, since there 
        |ren't that many young people it doesn't really help when what you got of your country's future is out there studying th
        |ir brains out at cram schools or participating in club sports instead of spending that valuable time to explore.


        |I have to wonder, do Japanese people actually like that kind of design?


            |I'm half Chinese. Asian websites are designed like that because languages like Chinese, Japanese and Korean lend th
            |mselves to much heavier compression than English does. You can fit a lot more text and information on the page with
            |ut necessarily sacrificing clarity or breaking language rules. Also, smartphones are a lot bigger in Asia than in A
            |erica. Cramming all of that stuff onto a page also makes mobile browsing more friendly. ////////Whenever I show Eng
            |ish websites to my Asian friends they always comment on how much wasted space there is. They like the clutter, and 
            |ust because it doesn't look nice it doesn't mean it's necessarily programmed or designed poorly. 


                |So what you're saying is that Asians hate whites...^pace.////EDIT: Whitespace, people. Whitespace. It's a desig

            |Yep. Look at Chinese and Japanese magazines, they look pretty similar.


            |I think so. Their magazines and TV shows are often cluttered with text also.


        |Other people's aesthetic is none of my business.


        |Web designer who almost did his internship in Japan here. To my recollection, the biggest browser userbase over there i
        | IE, so these sites are designed mainly around working in IE (whereas over here we'd design around Chrome/Firefox and t
        |en provide IE support, this also explains the lack of innovation in websites, not to say all of them are like this - th
        |re are some pretty cool websites in Japan.)////EDIT: Not sure why I'm being downvoted here but here are some statistics
        |to back it up: http://clicky.com/marketshare/jp/web-browsers/


        |different priorities.  perhaps they realize aesthetics are largely inconsequential to function.


        |That website doesn't look that bad. Sure it's not an amazing orgy of web design, but it looks effective and arguably be
        |ter than western sites like Amazon.


        |Japanese users feel more relaxed and happy when presented with lots of text. And then throw in some images with text. T
        |e reason the design looks like it does is because that is what converts users the best.////If you show them a modern US
        |style design for a new service, the page will be pretty bare and the Japanese users will not feel comfortable. So you l
        |se signups and sales, which is what drives online sites.


        |There are so many excuses in response to you that it's astounding. I've worked with Japanese e-commerce websites, and h
        |ve designed things in Japanese, and the simple truth is that, in general, their average web design could easily be much
        |better. Yes there are cultural preferences, yes they use more mobile, but completely outside of these issues the design
        |is often still crappy. It is entirely possible to pack in loads of information, in a mobile friendly format, and still 
        |ook good to both western and eastern eyes. The content is not the problem, shitty design is. While that's an aesthetic 
        |udgement, it's not purely cultural. There are plenty of Japanese websites that have what both westerners and easterners
        |would agree is objectively good design (if there is such a thing, but that's a different debate). 


        |To be fair, Apple has been pushing simplified design their entire time in business. //////Windows 8 looks like it was d
        |awn up by the people who design fisher price toys. //By this point I'm pretty well used to minimalistic chunky design. 


        |Asian markets are very inward looking. Especially the Korean, Chinese and Japanese Internet - western designs simply do
        |sn't suit their tastes.


        |I remember reading some stuff on the issue, it wasn't lack of training. it had to do with the ingrain culture of promot
        |ng people as a reward. The gist of it was, people with talent were being promoted out of the areas they really needed t
        | be in.////It had alot to do with all those hacks on their websites (sony...) that happened in the past couple of years


        |to be fair, the western (english) version of Ratuken has a better design. 


        |Wow, that really is a huge mess. Even the words are all messed up and jumbled.


        |Good web design won't stop the Cylons. We need to be perfecting cyber security now, before the Japanese invent the Cylo
        | race.


        |Yes, that web design has quite an interesting font choice, can't expect people to understand what they are trying to ge
        | across.


        |The mobile version is not bad


        |But their english page is okay.


        |Perhaps it's because I can barely read any Japanese at all, but it feels like that entire web page is yelling at me. :(


        |&gt;  http://www.rakuten.co.jp/////That looks just as cluttered as any Google site at its best. What's the problem?


        |You also have to realize culture transcends things like web design, there's a lot more going on there than just shitty 
        |eb design.


        |Why do web design or security when you can make VIDEO GAMES!

            |...and you had an onion on your belt, which was the style at the time.


        |Japan has a large elderly population who are very resistant to change, [Yahoo Japan](http://www.yahoo.co.jp) for exampl
        | has all of the same design problems as the site you just posted, the problem is that old websites can't change their d
        |sign easily without backlash, leading to websites that look like they were designed ten years ago because they were.


            |That looked pretty good on my phone


        |As a 14 year old web designer, I'm insulted.

        |I don't believe so. There's been talks of starting stuff like this in America however I don't think there's been any ac
        |ion. If I remember correctly one of our guest lecturers claimed that we only graduate something like 40% of the needed 
        |mount of qualified cybersecurity students to fill these positions. Not only that, in firms where no one else exists to 
        |ill these positions it's extremely hard to see whether or not these people are competent. 


            |Sure there's been action. [CyberPatriot](http://www.uscyberpatriot.org/Pages/default.aspx) is a large competition f
            |r high schoolers and I'm sure there are plenty more.


        |There is but it hasnt caught on very much since its a very difficult field to get into since it pulls from both crimina

        | to be exact) most of the time to get into security, you just need certifications an it background and an interest. But
        |its starting to sway more towards having your degree etc.

    |The problem is that there is very little support to learn computer science or electrical engineering. I know that at the lo
    |al university here, their CS tutoring hours are something like 11am-2pm or -3pm, Monday through Saturday. Those also happen
    |to be the hours where the intro classes are also scheduled. When you finally do manage to squeeze in an hour or 45 minutes 
    |o get some help, you get into a lab with 1 tutor and 12 students. Everyone drops out of the intro classes because there's n
    | way to keep people interested. Yeah, it's cool that the guys who have always had an interest stick it out and make out, bu
    | that doesn't change the fact the fact the number of people who can do more than set up a MAC address requirement on a rout
    |r is very low.


    |Are there certain cultures that seem to feature, promote, or for whatever reason, produce much better CS people, hackers, o
    | whatever you'd like to call it? This is a legitimate question; there might be a selection bias or a confirmation bias goin
    | on here, but I do get a sense that it's not equally distributed.////For example, in some of the Nordic countries, there se
    |ms to be some very prolific folks. DVD John, Pirate Bay, Linus Torvalds, etc.////And then there's Israel, which had the unp
    |blished MD5 attack that went into Iran; maybe that's simply because of the level of funding that they had?


    |could be taken directly from some novel in the 80s:"in 2013 the japanese began a program to recruit cyber soldiers to take 
    |ver the world or something"


    |This makes me laugh. I work for a Japanese company and they are severely behind the times in terms of technology (10-15 yea
    |s in some cases). Because of this, most of the IT staff are completely clueless and the majority have never even heard of L
    |nux, cloud computing, or virtualization. Just to give you an idea of how clueless they are, we had an "IT expert" from Japa
    | visit for several weeks because our office was rolling out a new ERP system. The dumb ass got busted by our local IT staff
    |for downloading massive amounts (gigabytes worth) of porn over the wireless network during business hours. When confronted,
    |he said he didn't think anyone could see him download porn over wireless.


        |Aren't you generalizing too much? That's the IT staff of just one company.


            |Expert implies that there is some level of commonly accepted level of knowledge that passes for expert among a gene
            |al community. So this should reflect the general knowledge of the discipline.


                |IT expert of one company, not necessarily representative of the IT industry in Japan. We don't even know the qu
                |lifications of this 'expert,' aside from his being from Japan, works for a Japanese company, and that NoMo know
                | him. 


            |Regardless, it's true. The Japanese are actually very clueless when it comes to the latest in tech. That's not an e
            |aggeration at all.


            |Maybe I am, but this seems to be a common theme with every Japanese company I've ever dealt with. I currently work 
            |or a Japanese company, but I have also worked with Japanese vendors and even a joint venture with a Japanese compan
            | in the past. In every case they make great products but they are clueless about technology and marketing.


    |The future of warfare will not be determined by how many guns you have, or how big your bullets are. Cyber warfare will bec

        |It will play a big part, that's for sure. However, infantry is still the best way to hold ground.

            |Propaganda to sway the collective consensus is another tool.


        |China is investing heavily in this apparently. Judging by the recent attacks on american websites they are getting fair
        |y good. A very interesting read is an article from 1995 in which Chinese generals highlighted the importance of informa
        |ion tech and hacking as a crucial part of wars in the future. Below some highlights from the article, which was also in
        |pired by the US military at the time:////"Information warfare is a means of armed struggle aimed at seizing the decisiv

        |" A U.S. combat theory analyst sums up the substance of information warfare in six points:////* To obtain intelligence

        |ensure our use of outer space information and to keep the enemy from using space information.////* To establish a compr

        |formation and intelligence data base.////* To use simulated means to help commanders make decisions."////And,more inter
        |stingly:////"The essential substance of information warfare in the narrow sense is made up of five major elements and t
        |o general areas. The five major elements are:////* Substantive destruction, the use of hard weapons to destroy enemy he

        |e better at identifying and rectifying legitimate threats. The only way to train them for this is to teach them how to 
        |ack. In addition, one or two additional hackers aren't going to make a huge difference. It's better to have a good pree
        |ptive defense than to only have a passive defense.


            |So it's a case of increasing home grown talent, which will inevitably lead to better overall protecting against for
            |ign attacks.  Yes, training more Japanese hackers will result in more attacks internally, but those are less danger
            |us than attacks from the outside.  ////i.e. if American hacker tries to hack a government installation, his motives
            |are more likely mischievous or political than dangerous.  Compare that to an attack from a Chinese or Russian hacke
