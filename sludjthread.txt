                |That was my problem in school. I'm so busy writing down notes I am not having time to comprehend what I am writ

                    |Pretty much the same for me, although I would write down key words an phrases that stood out to me as impor

                            | really clicks for me.


                        |A thousand times this. I could write fast enough to keep up with the notes, and follow what the teacher
                        | were saying, but I don't think I've ever looked through my notes before. Not that I could read them if

                    |Exactly the same with me. My computing teacher gets a lot of shit from the 'teacher teachers' because he ma

                    |Fuck yeah. I listen with all intensity and do my homework shortly thereafter. My homework is my notes. That

                    |Right. Then who goes back and rereads the notes?//Also, I tend to miss the fifth thing said while I'm takin

                        |I always miss specific details like names, dates, etc... doesn't that make everything useless?


                            |IA I'll start combining details.//YIKES!


                    |That's what I did from the start! Now I just take notes on the basics so I don't stick out like a sore thum

                    |ront of me so I look like I'm taking notes, when in reality I'm just trying to listen and pay attention.


                    |Same thing happened with me, I found decent notes for the course online so just used them and if I perfectl

                    |THIS is why I don't take notes! I fucking hate when teachers call me out on it (it's happened a few times).

                    | study method, but I'm not sure how well it would work.


                        |I know people who do it and say it helps, especially when they have the time to make them more organize
                        | than when they originally scribbled them down in class, but most people, myself included, don't do tha
                        |.


            |Why would you not take notes anyway?


                |We were actually told not to in some lectures.


                    |Really? That seems odd, we have the same setup with regards to blackboard but we're still encouraged to tak
                    | notes.


            |Almost all of my professors do this and I'm at a Community College. I rarely ever use it though I learn better thro
            |gh listening and scribbling random words and notes.

        |lol ill just remember it


        |Typically, I will jot down the date in the upper left hand corner and call it a day.


        |I'll just study the PowerPoint 


    |I take notes in every class and almost never look at them again.  Does wonders for the memory though. 


        |I tend to do better if I don't take notes because usually if I do, by the time I've finished writing one thing he's 10 
        |oints ahead, and I never got the chance to actually read what I wrote ////That, and classes don't come dubbed/subbed


            |That's why you take notes while you read the book, not while you listen to lecture.////Reading the book, you go at 
            |our own pace and writing helps you remember the things you learned. The next lecture, you take almost no notes. Any
            |things you write are just small annotations. Lectures are to solidify what you learned and ask questions


                |Reading textbooks?  Who does that?


                    |People who want to succeed.////Don't worry though, I'm sure without reading the book you can still make it 
                    |o the very top of the bell curve.

                        |That's a really good way to look at being average.


                            |No, that was ice cold sarcasm.


                |You seem to be coming at this from the perspective of wanting to learn.////Most college students go to college 
                |ecause they (mistakenly) believe it's a free ticket to a job. The learning part is an unfortunate side-effect.


                |The books are also useless for 80% of classes 


                |also, bring a tape recorder if your class will let you. or if you're in a big boy school use your smart phone t
                | record


                |The problem I have is that I don't really know how to take notes from a book. I'm unsure as to what's more impo
                |tant/relevant, and what I can just skip. For this reason, I have also never highlighted.


                    |Or you decide *fuck, I'm gonna try highlighting" and use up a whole highlighter's worth of ink per page

        |What I like to do is:////- Take Notes//- Reread Notes//- Reproduce those notes//- Make Flash Cards of key concepts and/
        |r things that require memorization////* Draw it all out on a piece of paper or whiteboard.////Probably a bit much for u
        |dergrad, but I'm working towards Doctorate and its absolutely necessary. 


            |Bullshit. 


                |When you have 300-400 slides worth of biochemical reactions, enzymes, allosteric effectors, and structures to m
                |morize you'll probably start to understand why this is necessary. ////That's just for 1 class. 


            |Yup, almost exactly how I do it! Rewriting notes is almost essential as you can clarify, summarize or expand furthe
            | as needed, and *organize* them in a way to help you.


            |that's what I did with some of the law classes I took... the physical act of writing something down over and over a
            |ain really helps you memorize it//


                |Its really amazing. It happens on so many levels. You're reading it, you're writing it, you're considering the 
                |amifications again...////It really works for me.//


            |How many hours do you spend studying outside of class for each hour you are in class? 


                |In Undergrad? Like at best 1 hr a day. I took typically 15-18 hrs. ////In Post Grad? I study at least 4 hours a
                |day.////I had a test today and I spent about 9 hours studying yesterday. I took my test, and now I'm eating. Af
                |er I'm going to go spend 4-5 hours getting back up to speed on my other classes. 


            |That is an awesome routine to get into.  In Organic Chem I had to do that because their wasn't a good way to reinfo
            |ce knowledge.  But with Calc and Physics I can just practice problems to do it so I don't really have to belabor it
            |too much.


        |This guy gets it. Notes aren't intended to replace coursebooks, but they help you process your material. Doodling proba
        |ly just distracts you further (unless you're a genius, in which case doodle away!).


        |[deleted]


            |That's a totally different reason


                |No, it's not. He is probably talking about how he would never look at his notes if he did write them. Reddit hi
                |emind just likes to hate on people with an ego. "I can easily remember everything"


                    |That's what I meant.


                        |But you just kind of missed the point. The guy said that writing down the notes helps him remember ever
                        |thing even though he never reads them. I'm just like you though. Fuck notes. I remember everything, and
                        |if I don't there's always a text book. For how little I look back on stuff, it's actually more efficien
                        | to just use the text. 


                    |&gt;I take notes in every class////He takes notes in every class. 


                |How is it different?


                    |Because he is saying the act of taking notes engrains the information into his memory. You, on the other ha
                    |d, apparently just remember it all without writing it first.


                        |Depends on the subject to be fair, If I write notes then I won't need to look at them again because I c
                        |n remember writing them down. Or I can just remember back to the lesson and everything that was said.


                            |Look everybody! This guy has memory!

    |er the notebook without a word. The reactions when they brought it back the next class were always hilarious, ranging from 
    | furious "the fuck is all this?" to thanking me and pretending it was very useful and then trying to quietly ask for someon
    | else's. 


    |I made it through all of high school with a single, 5 subject notebook.

    |So one of my accounting professors is a cunt. She randomly will collect notes then give them back at the end of class after

    |My notes would start in sloppy cursive and finish in gibberish and a faint line as I would inevitably fall asleep while wri
    |ing.


        |Does your faint line drag down the page? Because my letters turn sloppier until they are loopy scribbles and then the l
        |ne drags down the page.  And then I wake up and try again, only to have the same thing happen again


            |Yes, this is exactly what happens.


        |Cursive? Who the fuck writes in cursive after they stop making you in elementary school?


            |I don't print unless I have to. Cursive is easier.

    |That's how my college notebook was.


        |My midterm grade was less than perfect...


            |Just get to know a class mate that does keep awesome notes and ask for a copy of her notes before finals.  One of t
            |ose girls that color codes everything usaully works. "oh I was studying at starbucks and some asshole spilled coffe
            | all over my notes, I was wondering if you could do me a huge favour and let me photo copy your notes" 


                |This is a tad manipulative...have an upvote


                    |The point of college is to prepare you for the real world, where it is a valuable skill.


                        |If you can't lie convincingly by the end of college, you're fucked in the real world.


                |I'm an engineering major, there are no girls that color code :(


                |Or just make friends with someone who you can actually borrow notes from without having to lie...


                |As someone who takes really good notes and has a near 4.0 GPA, I like to tell those people to fuck right off. T
                |is is coming from a senior, too.


                |I was this girl all through high school and college. You don't have to lie to us. $20 or a few cups of coffee a
                |d saying "please" and "thank you" will do just as well. ////Also, if you're straight up, most of us will keep t
                |e arrangement with you- if assholes continuously spill coffee on your notes before every exam, we start to get 
                |uspicious. 


            |That's because you scribbled notes all over it! 


        |You mean "collage" I think


        |I like how you only had one.


    |Well I’m a schizophrenic working on my Ph.D. and my notes are great. Are you sure you’re not just a lazy spoiled kid, who d
    |esn’t know what it is like to work hard? 


        |That escalated quickly.


            |Sorry had a rough day and I’m just so tired of the schizophrenic stereotypes. And it kind of bothers me used in OP´
            | context. 


                |It's cool. I can see why you react the way you did. If it is any consolation, I think OP figured that a schizop
                |renic would be a more funny example than a person that uses one notebook for all classes.


                    |Yes I did figure that. Perhaps an ambien walrus reference would have been more appropriate?


                |Meant no disrespect man. Just thought it would be funny :/ now I feel like an ass


            |He did say he was schizo.


        |Sheeeeeeeiiiiit!


        |I would say I'm a pretty good student and I do the same.////I'm in undergrad and our school is pretty organised so we h
        |ve material for pretty much any course, often made by professors.////to me, organising my notes is a lot of wasted time
        | I can understand some people may enjoy the repeat, but I study engineering, so reading the material again isn't the mo
        |t desirable method of practice, I'd be better off practising questions.


        |Well that was aggressive.


            |To be fair, the guy's title was unfair to schizophrenics.


                |Most people don't know anything about schizophrenia because of the way it's portrayed in media. Can't fault OP 
                |or that.


                    |He's sure as hell not helping. The more people who reconsider what they've learned throughout their lives a
                    |out mental disorders, the better.


            |Again I’m sorry for being aggressive. If OP had used a term like “I was lazy like a Mexican” a lot of people would 
            |ind that very offensive, and rightfully so. Schizophrenic people often experience people discarding everything they
            |say as just ramblings. It’s a constant fight for being taken seriously. 


        |Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeit son, that's harsh!


        |haha. Good for you man! Good luck with your PHD! :D


        |So, do you have different voices telling yourself the answers during exams?


        |Well I always say, work smarter, not harder.


        |I Work two jobs while taking 18 credits. So I guess I'm half-lazy. Kudos to you though, guy.


        |Is one of your delusions that you can deduce people's personality types based on an internet meme they posted?


        |wat////Lack of organization skills / lack of need to organize =/= failure to work hard


            |The meme is of a lazy college student. OP is implying that he is lazy. Last time I checked lazy people don't work h
            |rd. Try again.


    |If you mean notebook computer, then yes, obviously.


    |I do this too, but I actually never look back at the notes I take. I only do it because writing things down helps me rememb
    |r them better. If I actually felt compelled to study for an exam I would download the lecture slides, which are about 500% 
    |ore legible than my own handwriting.


    |Second year chemistry major, and [these are just my semester 1 notes.](http://i.imgur.com/CR943PT.jpg?1)


    |A notebook for each subject? Like I'm gonna carry that shit around... ////One subject spiral notebook. When it's full, sepa
    |ate the pages by subject for later and start a new one. 


    |One subject notebook?  Doodle pad.


    |I do this! Everything in one place, in order by when it happened. I don't date anything either.  My mind is pretty good abo
    |t remembering what happens before what in time so I don't find dating necessary.  I actually find this to be a lot more org
    |nized than having a bunch of different folders and binders. //


    |Who needs notes.   Make a smart friend, wait until they write their condensed 5 pages of study notes,  photocopy them, read
    |them 30 times get a B.


        |show up to class, pay attention, get a B


    |I would only write about 5-6 pages in  each notebook and then call it a day. 


        |5-6 pages, of which 5 were doodles 


    |Well.. Yeah of course one. You take one tear off notebook, write everything in it for the day/week/semester , and at the en
    | of the day/week/semester you sort it by subject ////All you need to do is write the name of the course and the date on the
    |paper 


    |Totally is me


    |What notebook?


    |I think I had 3 classes my senior year and one "lab"


    |I actually use one notebook for all my notes because I forces me to look at my past notes before writing new ones. 


    |This is the only acceptable method! 


    |I just use last semesters notebooks and go backwards. I've never run out of space.


    |Me too OP.


    |i don't even have a notebook i use the note pages that came with my free agenda


    |All subject notebook/folder.


    |I managed to get through my last 5 semesters of undergrad (which translated to about 28 classes) with the same five single-
    |ubject notebooks. I was pretty proud of myself.


    |*scratches head*////I just use loose paper - and sometimes it's just regular copy paper at that, and then that gets stuffed
    |into a multi-section folder where it's eventually sorted out. ////Binders? Aint nobody got time for that! 


    |Makes me cringe. I love keeping neat notebooks 


    |Legal pads are hard mode.


    |That would drive me insane! I would never be able to find anything and would never be able to figure out which class they w
    |re for.


    |I've used the same 5 subject note book for 3 semesters now. 


    |I used one 3 subject notebook for all quarters of my senior year. Notes were incomprehensible with History following math f
    |llowing "nutrition", but hey, it got the job done.


    |Best thing I ever learned in college:  I do 100 times better if I don't take notes.  Sit in class and pay attention.... rem
    |mber about 95% of what the teacher says.  Take notes... walk out and I don't know a damn thing.  


    |I've never used a notebook for notes in a class. I'm one of those auditory learners.


    |i've had the same notebook for the past 4 semesters


    |Every term I started with a fresh single-subject note book or fresh section of a 3-subject note book.////Every term I ended
    |with a notebook that had maybe 1/5 of it full of notes and 4/5 of blank pages.////WHO USES THE WHOLE NOTE BOOK!?  I could u
    |e the same one an entire year of high school and still maybe get 1/2 way through.


        |Latin students. ////I've got like three notebooks full of endlessly repeated drills.////a------ae////ae-----arum////ae-
        |---is////am----as////a------is////Ad nauseam, ad infinitum. 


    |That lasts 2 years


    |In college, I had one legal pad that I used to take notes for every class.  At the end of the day (or whatever time period)
    | I would separate the notes for each class and put them in that class's own three-ring binder, which I could bring with me 
    |hen I needed it.


    |Senior year College student here.//What notes?


    |This is why I like my laptop.  I just makes the notes on Google Drive/pretend like I'm taking notes while actually playing 
    |y Steam games.


    |I've been using the same 3 subject notebook for the past 2 years of college. 99% of the pages are scribbles and random dood
    |ing. 


    |That's not lazy, that's called cheap.


    |I feel like the worst student but I only have one notebook and one folder for all my classes, and I've been like this since
    |middle school . It's the only organization system that's worked for me and I'm not changing it now. 


    |that's actually kind of awesome. it would drive me nuts though. kudos for being able to pull it off. I tried paper notes wh
    |n I started college, didn't work out too well. 


    |I on the other hand just started using MS One Note with a Cornell Notes template.  Are they a huge pain in the ass?  Sure. 
    |But they work well.


    |I thought people enjoyed my ramblings.


    |MY NOTES ARE THE RAMBLINGS OF A SCHIZOPHRENIC. WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON. ////


    |I keep a notebook out just so that when I'm really bored, I can play the "remember the pokemon game."  One on page of noteb
    |ok, I try to write down the names of all 151 pokemon as quickly as I can from memory.  I usually end up using the pokerap a

    |I've got one per class and a 3-ring for taking book notes...wut


    |I do this. It helps not waste the paper at the end of the notebook you never use.


    |Something, something enzyme assay.


    |I'm about to finish my MBA and all I've used is a single 5-subject notebook.  


    |Same here. I have one notebook that I use for really rough notes in every class then when I go home I type them up neatly. 
    | never look at my hand-written notes because they are incomplete and usually in some kind of short-hand. 


    |I have some schizophrenic ramblings.  Let's compare notes!


    |they see me math i n the mind of george stein no when kill kil ne why +1


    |A teacher called me out for doing this last week. 'these notes aren't for my class. On this day you only wrote two sentence
    |!'


    |This will prove detrimental to your post secondary education. Surely they taught you the many different methods of note tak
    |ng before graduation? ////These are essential skills needed for post secondary not just for college but the workplace as we
    |l, you should take this more seriously and I assure you improvement, sounds wacky right? It's not.


    |In 11th grade I picked strange habit of crossing out any mistakes I make with very frantic, nearly nervous zigzags, whereas
    |in middle school I used to place the mistake in accurate and clean brackets. Anyone has similar problems?


    |I think you mean "0 subject notebook"


    |Are you me?


    |MY notes are like the ramblings of a normal person...... wait, then that must mean, I'm schizophrenic! 


    |please post extracts.


    |Best thing I ever did related to college: Invest in a very high quality USB microphone, Dragon Naturally Speaking, and down
    |oad Audacity.  I was able to create very passable transcripts of almost all lectures, provided I was relatively close to th
    | professor, or near a speaker if it was a larger lecture hall and s/he was mic'd.  When studying I could search by topic/ke
    |word through transcripts of an entire semesters worth of verbatim lectures for exam cramming.  I could even search by profe
    |sor hints like, "remember", "exam", "need to know", etc. ////Note: this does not work well for extremely technical classes 
    |ith extensive jargon / vocabulary or long equation based examples as the transcripts can turn to hell.  For that, I would h
    |ve been better off transcribing the recordings myself, but I found it easier to just pay close attention in those classes a
    |d join study groups that could meet and exchange notes and work through more difficult concepts together. ////Also, I would
    |try to find PDFs or Kindle versions of textbooks if possible for the same purpose of finding relevant information quickly. 
    | Work smarter, not harder. ////For classes that specifically forbid recording lectures, I didn't record because it wasn't w
    |rth it to get caught.  If you have the balls you can try and pass off the mic as an external wireless card.  I don't recomm
    |nd that. 


    |I used to use one notebook for 2 classes. Class 1 would start on page 1 while Class 2 would start on the last page with bot
    | working towards the middle. I rarely had overlap between the 2 classes.


    |Well, I've only used one notebook since the end of middle school. I actually remember from 5th or 6th grade where I had for
    |otten my notebook home and so took one sheet from a friend. I used that single piece of sheet for like 2.3 months, scribbli
    |g allover it, in all directions and with letter as high as maybe 2 mm. Damn I was weird back then.


    |I used to do this with a small binder. Class, date and page # on the top of each page. ////Then every week or two the notes
    |went into file folders by class for safe keeping. That way if I ever lost the binder I was only out a week or so worth of n
    |tes to try to copy, rather than a whole semester's.


    |I always would leave like 20 pages blank between notes no idea why, but then when I found them it was like the the holy gra
    |l of knowledge. Also went to class drunk one morning, best notes I have ever taken with only one weird sentence that I beli
    |ve was my friend talking to me.


    |Most of my college notebooks were taking up by doodles. If there is one thing I gained out of college, it was that I got re
    |lly fucking good at doodling screaming avacados and happy little puddings. Also rayguns.


    |I tried using evernote to take notes. However, when formulas and greek letters get involved I just couldn't keep up (I was 
    |sing [this](http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php?lang=en-us)). Fuck it, I'll read from the textbook like I always do


    |My method for the past two years has been a clipboard with a bunch of random pages of lined paper. All of my notes are mixe
    | up because of this and none of the pages are numbered. Sometimes I even run out of paper so I write about two different su
    |jects on the same page!!!


    |I remember the days of having one 3-ring binder for each class.  Now I have one notebook and the only thing in it is blank 
    |apers and syllabuses. 


    |That one day where the teacher decides to grade notes and gives you an F even if you understood the topic.


    |And we'll all pretend you even look at them before tests.   Definitely not skimming the book for keywords and formulas 15 m
    |nutes before the test.


    |Why is it soo difficult to be organized?!


    |Pro Tip: ////Those shitty 70 page colored notebooks they sell for like $0.25 during Back to School? Buy about 20 of those i
    | assorted colors.////Buy folders with matching colors.////Congratulations, you're organized.


    |my teacher in highschool picked on me for my messy notes soon after a close relative died and i was still in mourning . he 
    |hrew me out of the class and lectured me in anger in the hallway. ////he probably is sitting rich and comfortable now retir
    |d thinking he was a good person. 


    |At the start of every semester I would try my best to take good notes. But the quality would eventually degrade to a point 
    |here they would be useless. I would then give up and photocopy someone elses notes.


    |so... i took some pictures of my all subjects notebook...////[album here xD](http://imgur.com/a/poaqX)////it looks like i w
    |rk more for karma than i do for grades .... 


    |Yeah this is what i do. Studying becomes a game of "Where's Waldo?" Only the stakes consist of my future financial stabilit
    |.


    |I'm on that all-subject 3.5" x 5.5" moleskine. Get on my level. 


    |My strategy was "3-subject notebook? This should last me all 5 years of college."////Year 4, still going strong. 


    |I originally had thought this meme was meant to express ways experienced college students learned to cut corners and avoid 
    |oing unnecessary tasks in order to save time. ////Now it just seems to be lazy unambitiousness, like FBF goes to college.


    |I bought books just to doodle in, for some reason it never crossed my mind to write in them.


    |I have the opposite problem, one class spread over multiple one subject note books.


    |My note book was the same way in college. Except I doodled like a motherfucker so it was pretty crazy looking back at them.
    |A bit worrisome really. 


    |My supervisor has asked to see the notes I make when I'm working through an idea relating to my thesis. She's going to regr
    |t it. My notes also resemble the ramblings of a schizophrenic


    |What sick, silly puppets we are and what a gross little stage we dance on.  What fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a ca
    |e in the world, not knowing that we are nothing.  We are not what God intended.////On the subway today, a man came to me to
    |start a conversation.  He was making small talk, this lonely man, talking about the weather and other things. I tried to be
    |pleasant and accommodating, but my head began to hurt from his banality.  I almost didn't notice it happened, but I suddenl
    | threw up all over him.  He was not pleased, but I couldn't help laughing.


    |whatever.  I've succeeded in school since teachers stopped enforcing the stupid 1-notebook per subject rule.  i swear middl
    |/highschool teachers are in cahoots with Mead.


    |Hahahaha I was exactly like that!
