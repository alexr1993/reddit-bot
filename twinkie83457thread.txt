NO MORE PARTIES FOR YOU!(/r/funny)




    |Tea parties motherfucker 


        |Alice in Wonderland themed tea parties on acid. 


            |Or just lemon themed parties.


                |Maybe some lemon stealing whores will show up.


                    |LEMON STEALING WHORES!!!


                |It's not a Lemon party without ol' Dick!

                |Dosing people is never cool man.


            |WHERE CAN I FIND THIS


            |Does acid count as a drug?


                |Well why the fuck wouldn't it


                |Yes.


                    |hydrochloric acid?


                        |No thats why its perfectly safe for kids.


                |the orange is not whole with life, unless somebody finds two ways to go. In any case we need the entire? guy.


                |It does. But DMT shouldn't; our brains produce it naturally.////DMT party, anyone?


                    |Not really a good point, since many drugs (prescribed as well) give you something that your body produces n
                    |turally. Think of adrenaline, cortisol and all the other hormones. MDMA, while not naturally in your body, 
                    |acilitates natural neurotransmitters like serotonin, ocytocin and dopamine.


                        |I know, I was kidding.


                |Acid = LSD. It stands for Lysergic *Acid* Diethylamide


                |Only for squares man.


                |Uh, yes?


                |apparently not.

                |.......Steve.


                |...what's he got to do with it? What kind of name is *Steve* anyhow?

            |Tiny Tina would like a word with you.


                |Hey now, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want my kid going to one of Tiny Tina's tea parties. 


                    |They would learn about explosions though...

            |[Myth.](http://www.snopes.com/risque/kinky/vodka.asp)


                |It would still work////Although inserting an alcohol-soaked tampon could theoretically get someone drunk, it's 
                |isky business. Absorbing alcohol through a mucous membrane (any part of the body that is involved in absorption
                |and secretion) allows for the alcohol to be absorbed directly to the bloodstream, leading to a more rapid intox
                |cation. But here’s the danger — since the alcohol is not being absorbed through the stomach, a person cannot vo
                |it if they have too much to drink. And once alcohol enters the bloodstream, you can’t get it back out. This sig
                |ificantly increases the risk for alcohol poisoning. Moreover, the acidity of alcohol can potentially cause phys
                |cal pain and damage to the mucous membranes in the vagina or anus. Ouch!//


                    |Something about the "Ouch!" at the end made that whole thing sound like it should be a "Fun facts about alc

                        |NOW YOU KNOOOOOOW!!!


                |Even if that one's a myth, there's still vaporizing, anal chugging, direct to bloodstream and god knows how man

                    |I never understood how butt chugging became a thing. "Bro wanna funnel this beer into my ass?"


                |I have personally seen a couple of my friends do this. It isn't a myth in the slightest. They generally do it o
                | planes.


            |And some guys do butt chugging. It's the latest craze. A frat in Florida had to hold a press conference about it.

    |Weirdest thing, when I was younger (14-18, HS essentially) my parents wouldn't care if I went out until 1 or 2AM, just as l

    |my motive and reasoning for it.

            |And once they catch you, you can act like you thought they were okay with it.

        |Your parent's wouldn't care when you were 14-18? That's the worst age group for drinking, doing drugs and having sex. Y
        |u do it, but you have zero experience. Once you're an adult, you've probably developed at least a little bit of common 
        |ense when it comes to all three. But as a teenager, you're going to do stupid shit whilst doing them. 


            |My parents basically let me do anything I wanted growing up, they also really didn't care what my grades were. I co

            |That's not always an option for young people today, even when they have jobs. 


                |Very true. It is actually a good financial option for young people nowadays to live with their parents while th

                |At the least, if your parents are coddling you around at age 22 like a child, it's time to start setting bounda

        |It's not a Lemon party without old Dick 


        |Nothing is worse than a surprise Lemon party.


        |Cuz a Liz Lemon party is MANDATORY.


        |One party I'd enjoy.


    |Stannis?


    |Hm this sounds like me as a teenager...////I once got in trouble for hosting a party when my parents were out of town. They
    |could tell by the number of empty Country Time Lemonade cans and appetizer boxes in the trash.////After having raised both 
    |f my siblings that threw crazy parties with booze, destruction, etc, they really didn't even bother to punish me. In fact m
    | parents offered to host my next party while they're in town, which was awesome because my mom made food and drinks for us.
    |///Some of my friends left the group to help her clean up and do dishes.////Yeah I was a nerd.


    |This wasn't funny at all.


    |The kids fave never changes. He just has no reaction at all.////Looks to me like he isn't *going* to take drugs, he's alrea
    |y high.


    |My guess is the kid isn't taking anything, as all of the above will already be there.


    |Red?


    |[It's the most boring fucking generation in the history of people.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCc_Q60L0S8)////As usual
    | Doug nails it.


    |No one takes alcohol, unless of course they're taking it *to* the party.  You drink alcohol.


        |*partake* in alcohol


    |Taking alcohol?


    |"Patient asks: will i get as old as 100years?//Doctor: Well, do you drink? No. Do you smoke? No. (and so on)//Then why do w
    |nt to live that long?"


    |reddit has really gone downhill////edit: after reading through a lot of the comments here, the average age of reddit now se
    |ms to be about 16.


        |I'm 15 my good sir, I demand a revote! /sarcasm


    |I went to parties when I was young. I didn't drink, smoke or take drugs.////Yet, I had a lot of fun. I don't see why he can
    |t go.


    |Any idea when this comic was made? Pretty sure I saw it on Sickipedia


    |LAN parties muthafukka!


    |Is the kid blind?


    |i hate parties...


    |I really needed that laugh. Thank you so much. 


    |To play computer games of course!


    |Maybe he just wants to listen to rock'n'roll. 


    |I'd like to see the dad saying that to his daughter. 


    |Lemon Party?


    |LAN parties can be hardcore from time to time.


    |'Because, dad, I think you may be mental'


    |Dad its only a political party calm down!


    |Yeah, whenever I'm home and go out nowadays, my parents pretty much expect me to come back fucked up.

    |A bit of a redundant questioning. What's the difference between drugs and alcohol?


        |there is no technical difference, but theres a societal difference. 


    |sXe for life.


    |My mom would ask me these questions and my answers were always maybe a little, depends what they have, and god I hope so!


    |I never really wanted to go to the party in the first place.


    |Too bad that there was a spoiler in the title. 


    |That reminds me of an old joke:////A guy goes to the doctor and asks the doctor how he can live to be 100.////The doctor as
    |s if the man smokes, the man says "nope, I stayed away from those things as a kid and seeing what they did to my friends no
    |, I'm glad I stayed away from them."////The doctor asks if the man drinks, the man says "nope, I haven't had a drop of alco
    |ol my entire life."////The doctor asks if the man eats unhealthy food (fried/sugary food), the man says "nope, I'm a vegeta
    |ian and if you're wondering about exercise I do that as well."////The doctor then asks the man: "well then why the fuck do 
    |ou want to live to be 100?"


    |Pokemon party duhhh


    |Whats up with tea parties?//


    |"Let's *take* alcohol!" - The coolest guy at the party

    |Oh man, for a second there I totally thought the dad was the atypical parent trying to protect their child, but then bam! R
    |ght there at the end it totally changed up. ////Totally /r/funny worth. In that it's the typical shitpost crap. 


    |This is essentially my mom. Always rooting for me to have a good time, just as long as I call her for a ride home safely.


    |Saw the punchline coming a mile away?


    |How is this funny at all?


    |To socialize.


        |Eeeeeewwww, being with people? That smells.


    |Dance &amp; listen to music with girls?


        |*right*


    |When did "partying" become a euphemism for for getting drunk?


        |Pretty much since the end of prohibition, possibly a little before.

    |If it's a party your parents know you're at...it's not a party


    |The sad part is that many people believe you need to have all that to have a party. 


        |you must be fun at parties.


        |You dont need it but it's pretty helpful. 


        |well, the alcohol one is pretty good.

        |They do, or else you'd just hang out at school


        |It's a joke.
