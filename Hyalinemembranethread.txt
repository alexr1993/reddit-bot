    |http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achtiname_of_Muhammad////&gt;"This is a message from Muhammad ibn Abdullah, as a covenant to t
    |ose who adopt Christianity, near and far, we are with them. Verily I, the servants, the helpers, and my followers defend th
    |m, because Christians are my citizens; and by God! I hold out against anything that displeases them. No compulsion is to be
    |on them. Neither are their judges to be removed from their jobs nor their monks from their monasteries. No one is to destro
    | a house of their religion, to damage it, or to carry anything from it to the Muslims' houses. Should anyone take any of th
    |se, he would spoil God's covenant and disobey His Prophet. Verily, they are my allies and have my secure charter against al
    | that they hate. No one is to force them to travel or to oblige them to fight. The Muslims are to fight for them. If a fema
    |e Christian is married to a Muslim, it is not to take place without her approval. She is not to be prevented from visiting 
    |er church to pray. Their churches are to be respected. They are neither to be prevented from repairing them nor the sacredn
    |ss of their covenants. No one of the nation (Muslims) is to disobey the covenant till the Last Day (end of the world)."


        |&gt;You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those wh
        | associate others with Allah; and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, "We ar
        | Christians." That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant.////Quran 5:82////That
        |said, does not mean all Jews are bad.////Also when the Muslims conquered Egypt they pretty much allowed the Christians 
        |o run their own affairs - bought back the Egyptian Pope back from exile and told him to look after his people. Which is
        |in stark contrast to what is going on in Egypt now.////Also during the run up to the Battle of Yarmouk the people of Ah
        |Sham (Syria) insisted that the Muslims protect them in return for Jizya (military exception tax). The Muslims agreed. W
        |en the Muslims realized the size of the Byzantine army they went to the Christian towns/villages and returned the money
        |saying "We are unable to fulfill our side of the contract so here is your money - however assume our agreement is still
        |in force and once we're given victory we'll take off were we left off"////The Christians replied "We pray for your vict
        |ry because if the Byzantines had been here not only would they not have returned the money, they would have taken what 
        |e had left too"////edit: Just an extra bit about Egypt and Egyptians in Islamic texts:////&gt;Abu Zar reported that All
        |h's Messenger (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said: "You will conquer Egypt, a land where Qirat (a measure of weight and

        |you**. ////[Reported by Imams Muslim Ahmad]////------------------////////Second edit: Some people are saying Islam is a

                |That is a Medinan sura in where the prophet was referring to a specific tribe of Jews that had betrayed the con

                |ic group of Jews", not "The Jews in their entirety".

                        |[Etymological fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymological_fallacy).


                        |1) "Hamite" doesn't mean anything. It used to group together supposed descendants of Noah's son Ham...b
                        |t literal belief in the existence of Ham is no longer accepted. ////2) "Anti-semitic" is a word of Germ
                        |n origin that targets Jews specifically, not Semitic people in general. 


                            |I understand that the word "anti-Semitism" was created in modern times to refer specifically to Jew
                            |.////So, in terms of etymology, prejudice against Arabs and other on-Jewish people who speak Semiti
                            | languages isn't anti-Semitism. ////In real life, though, my experience is that people who are very
                            |prejudiced against either Jews or Arabs (or Muslims in general) are usually anti nice ness in gener
                            |l, whether they recognize that or not. If, say, they think they adore Jews and hate Muslims, that m
                            |ans they're failing to recognize that Jews can be jerks and lumping all Muslims together, and vice 
                            |ersa. ////In the real world, mature people can see that there are jerks in all communities and good
                            |people in all communities.

                            |Now you are just arguing semantics...


                                |About Hamite or Anti-semitic? With either one it seems important to keep your definitions clear

                                | anti-, the terms "Semitic" and "antisemitic" are not directly opposed to each other, making th
                                | term a misnomer. "Antisemitism refers specifically to prejudice against Jews alone and in gene
                                |al,[2][4] despite the fact that there are other speakers of Semitic languages (e.g. Arabs, Ethi
                                |pians, or Assyrians) and that not all Jews speak a Semitic language."


                                |Now you are just arguing semitics...


                            |My main issue with the term "anti-semite" is that it is too broad. Does it only include people with
                            |the Jewish lineage and family history or people who follow Judaism also. As far as linage goes, it 
                            |s pretty safe to say that not all Jews are from the same lineage (there are some Jewish people livi
                            |g in Iran and Yemen that look nothing like the ones in the U.S and Israel). //I'm not an expert in 
                            |eritage but I don't like the word anti-semitic, it is too ambiguous in my understanding. Some Germa
                            |s did really horrific things during that period, and I'm not sure why this term is to be taken from
                            |a terrible era. ////I also don't understand why the hate for Jewish people has to be specific with 
                            |his term while hate against blacks, latinos,... or any race is just pure racism. For me, hate again
                            |t a human for his race is pure stupid and not specific.


                                |Anti-Semite is a good term to silence disagreement which is why it's so liberally used. Due to 
                                |he Holocaust it's much more effective than simply calling someone a racist. ////There's also th
                                | issue of Jewishness itself. Judaism is a religion and its followers are Jews, but being a Jew 
                                |s also extremely racial. Due to the mixed identification, so to speak, Anti-Semitism is probabl
                                | the specific term.


                    |&gt;the prophet was referring to a specific tribe of Jews ////In Islam the Quran is considered the word of 
                    |od so it would be "God referring to...."


                        |Even more so; The Qur'an itself is the physical embodiment of God's will through his followers. Each co
                        |y is a holy relic in its own right, more so than things like the Bible. 


                    |That is true. ////There was the Medina Pact that basically said that if any tribe of Medina was attacked, t
                    |en it was an attack against Medina as a whole. A specific Jewish tribe failed to honor the pact and went ag
                    |inst the Muslims. 


                    |The Jews and Christians are referred to as People of the book by Muslims. 


                    |There is a companion, Salman al-Farsi, whose real name was Shalluman. He was from Persia, but he was a Jew,
                    |and he was the Exilarch. The Exilarch is the spiritual leader of all diaspora Jews. While residing in Persi
                    |, he heard about the arrival of a Prophet which was foretold in the Jewish scripture. Eventually he made hi
                    | way to Muhammad and became his follower. Due to this, many Jews in Arabia, and beyond, also became followe
                    |s of Muhammad, either by converting to Islam or remaining as Jews but loyal to him. Interestingly, some his
                    |orians mention how Salman was also part of the family of the Prophet. Muhammad was fond of Jews and they of
                    |him. When it is mentioned the conflict against "the Jews", it is always in reference to the three tribes, o
                    | rather, people within the three tribes, who betrayed the Prophet to the chieftains of the Quraish. 


                |Jews became the default bankers in much of the Abrahamic world, because they had no prohibition against handlin

                |It is rooted in economic difference in each religious system, chtistians and muslim are forbidden to make money
                |on giving loans (interest) and jews are allowed to, hence they have been rejected in many societies since they 
                |re understood as if they are making money doing nothing.

                |That's just not accurate at all.//////It's not "hatred of the Jews". Jews were a political entity and whilst th

                |Jews are incredibly ethnocentric and, generally speaking, look out for their own group and take care of each ot

                    |They attack other Muslims because they're the wrong kind of Muslim. The issue is still religion.


                        |Not as a general rule.  Even more common is they kill people for political reasons, like "person X supp
                        |rts government Y".  Or else they kill people as a terror tactic, just to prove that they can, to try an

                        |   


                            |They want their religious sect to be the one holding political power and will kill members of other
                            |religious sects that stand in their way. Religion is at the heart of the conflict.

                |funny thing is many of the muslims today would fail to answer some of the questions


            |You raise an excellent point but in a way, doesn't that make their actions even more noble? Since their lives could
            |literally be in danger? 


            |&gt; The only people Muslim extremists like to kill more than non-Muslims are other Muslims.////But.. but... once y

            |The more muslims are killed the more virgins are left for muslims. Genius!!!


        |Christians, Jews and Muslims are all cut from the same cloth at the end of the day. They're all people of the book, as 
        |he Muslim faithful would say. ////You wouldn't chop your familial cousin into little pieces for being a bit different, 
        |o why should you butcher your religious cousins? They're all Abrahamic religions at the end of the day. They're all wor

        |and Jews as they are recognized for their belief in who they view as the one, true god.


            |I understand what you're saying ... but it sounds rather hilarious to me, to be honest.////my friend, people hack o
            |e another for being a bit different in all sorts of circumstances. we are all human beings, cut from the same cloth
            | and yet for reasons religious and non-religious, people kill one another routinely.////so what you're saying seems
            |neat &amp; tidy as an explanation to this story, but frankly people are killing another for even smaller difference


                |Yeah, I'm not so small a person that I can't recognize that problem on a grander scale. What I'm saying is that
                |the Muslims that protected the Christian church are adhering to their religion's beliefs.////In comparison, the
                |mob attacking the church are contradicting the teachings and morals of their religion by getting together to vi
                |timize Christians that are acknowledged as a tolerated minority in the Quran. I mean, what exactly is the point
                |of identifying as a Muslim if you're going to just ignore the system of beliefs whenever it suits you?


                    |The tolerant ones do this to. The Quran is not as terrible as some would have you believe, but nor is it en
                    |irely happiness and love. Any Muslim who believes in evolution is doing the same thing as the fanatics, dis
                    |ounting part of their holy book because it does say what they believe to be true. So, they discount part bu
                    | hold the bits they like to be infallible.


                        |The Quran does not speak of the biological creation of man in much detail, as it is not necessary for t
                        |e divine narrative at hand, and in fact speaks well on the topic of fetal development, and the expansio
                        | of the universe from a single point. It is not a book of science, but it's science is surprisingly acc
                        |rate. Any resistance you see or hear from Muslim professors, clerics or imams on the fact of evolution 
                        |hould be preceded by asking where these clerics are coming from, ideologically.


                        |At the end of the day, these examples we're entertaining aren't representative of the silent majority o
                        | Muslims who just keep their heads down and adhere to the tenets of their chosen faith as  best as they
                        |can.////There will always be contradictions and double standards, but the people who actively do this a
                        |d acknowledge themselves as doing so cannot be called real Muslims, much as a Christian who flat out ig
                        |ores the teachings of the bible and related texts cannot be called a true Christian and so on.


                            |At the end of the day. When the day is finished. You know, at the end of the day.


                            |That really depends on what constitutes a Muslim or Christian. There isn't an objectively correct d
                            |finition of either, words don't work that way. So, in the end, it's more complicated than they are 
                            |ot true Christians. Is believing in Jesus and God all it takes to be a Christian, or does it also r
                            |quire other beliefs?


                                |That all comes down to your chosen branch of Christianity. You have to obey the tenets of that 
                                |iven sect if you actually identify as one of them, or you're nothing but a fake. Identify as Ca

                                |rent between the beliefs of a fundamentalist Wahhabi Muslim and members from other sects.


                                    |What constitutes Christianity, though? Everybody agrees it at least includes believing in J
                                    |sus and God, but are there other requirements?


                                        |That varies from group to group. For Catholics the Sacraments and related rituals are a
                                        |must, for example.


                        |Quran didn't mention anything for/against evolution though.////The only part about evolution that  musl
                        |ms is Very against is the misconception that humans come from monkeys.


                    |There's plenty in the Quran to justify the peaceful acts of the people protecting the church, but there are
                    |also many passages in the Quran calling for violence against non-Muslims. The group who only follows the pe

            |What about non-people of the book? Fuck them right?


                |Well not really. While Ahul-Kitab (the people of the scriptures) refers to Jews and Christians it does not disc
                |unt that other religions also came from the same source. In Islam there are said to have been 100,000+ prophets
                |sent to every nation on earth in the past.////How much those religions have changed since is a different matter

                    |Yes, it looks like monotheistic religions are treated better than poly or animistic religions.

                |y nice back in the day. 


                    |What about by today's standard? It seems like Islam considers Muslims to be first class citizens, other peo
                    |le of the book to be second class, and non-book people as third class.


                    |Maybe next you should think about changing that part about how Muslims are allowed to force non-Muslim wome
                    | whom they've conquered into sexual slavery. ////This whole Muslims forming a human chain around Christians

                    |blems in Islam are numerous an varied. Whether its the widespread acceptance of pedophilia, the non-chalant
                    |acceptance of ridiculous conspiracy theories (all of which place the blame on anything other than Muslims),
                    |or the various other problems which I noticed to be a plague in the Muslim community (violence against wome
                    |, support for hudood laws, contempt of non-Muslims), the underlying reality is that Islam needs to change. 


                        |Muslims are forbidden from forcing anyone to do their bidding, as humans are slaves to no other human b

                        |slim, isn't Islamic. Contempt of non-Muslims within the Muslim community confuses me, because we're req
                        |ired to love our neighbors, help our community in times of need, regardless of religion (or not religio
                        |). It's not up to us to judge anyone, simply because we don't know every person 100%. Backwards intoler
                        |nce is wrong even within Islam. Violence against women is also forbidden unless under very strict circu
                        |stances (as in self-defense or an absolute last resort). The Prophet never beat, or otherwise laid a fi
                        |ger on, his wives, and he's supposed to be a Muslim's ultimate role model. As for conspiracy theories, 
                        | agree. It upsets me that, in a religion that requires critical thinking, scientific progress, and the 
                        |eeking of knowledge ('Ilm), people can be so lazy and ignorant. I don't know just how different our upb
                        |ingings were, but I have seen the same problems you bring up, just not as the root being Islam. Having 
                        |tudied the Qur'an as relatively little (compared to scholars) as I have, it's already evident that it s
                        |eaks of peace, logic, and compassion for those near and far. Taken into context of when and where it wa
                        | revealed, it's exceedingly difficult to find fault with Islam on its own. Unfortunately, especially in
                        |Western culture, it's apparently difficult to separate Islam from Middle Eastern culture. I feel like t
                        |at's more the problem. If Muslims stuck to the entire message of the Prophet as opposed to picking what
                        |suits their agendas, the problems would be far less. In any demographic of 1.6 billion people, you're g

            |I grew up Muslim and I'm all for critiquing a religion. There are plenty of issues you could talk about in regards

                        |Well, by calling it "islamophobia" some people are trying to equate it to xenophobia and racism. 


                            |You say that like it's a false equivalence. It's pretty analogous.

                                |ts that you keep referencing so I know what we're talking about?


        |Yea, ignore the bit about the senseless attack on a church by non other than muslims. 


    |This is how good Muslims should behave.////The teachings(hadiths) of the Prophet Muhammed on how good Muslims should treat 
    |heir Non-Muslim friends and neighbours on a day to day basis as well as how to government should treat a Non-Muslim citizen
    |of a Muslim state.////&gt;"He who believes in God and the Last Day should honour his guest, should not harm his neighbour, 
    |hould speak good or keep quiet." (Bukhari, Muslim)////&gt;"Whoever hurts a Non-Muslim citizen of a Muslim state hurts me, a
    |d he who hurts me annoys God." (Bukhari)////&gt;"He who hurts a Non-Muslim citizen of a Muslim state, I am his adversary, a
    |d I shall be his adversary on the Day of a Judgement." (Bukhari)////&gt;"Beware on the Day of Judgement; I shall myself be 
    |omplainant against him who wrongs a Non-Muslim citizen of a Muslim state or lays on him a responsibility greater than he ca
    | bear or deprives him of anything that belongs to him." (Al-Mawardi)////&gt;"Anyone who kills a Non-Muslim who had become o
    |r ally will not smell the fragrance of Paradise." (Bukhari)


        |So pretty much like the overwhelming majority of people who consider themselves Muslim?


            |Yes. But I believe Muslims all over the world should be more active in stopping extremism/violence of any kind and 
            |peaking out against it.////There is another hadith of the prophet which says,//&gt;"He who amongst you sees somethi
            |g abominable should modify it with the help of his hand; and if he has not strength enough to do that, then he shou
            |d do it with his tongue; and if he has not strength enough to do even that, then he should (at least abhor it) from
            |his heart; and that is the least of faith.” 


                |While I agree you that there needs to be more people speaking out against, its important to recognize the thous
                |nds of people who already DO speak out against it as much as they can, but dont get their voices heard.////It's
                |not exactly going to make national news if I go out holding a sign saying "Muslims against Extremism" whereas i
                | an extremist kills a lot of people, its surely going to make the news. It just feels like the amount of media 
                |s clearly focused more on one side than the other.


    |There are more Muslims fighting Muslim extremists in this world than Westerners fighting them, but you won't hear this thro
    |gh MSM (due to military-industrial complex ties).


        |While I agree with you, I can't help but also point out that there are more muslims in the world than there are western
        |rs.


            |Which would validate his claim...


            |Yes, I'm aware of that. I think of it every time I hear Murican politicians say the USA needs to "lead" the world./
            |"lead"(n) also means "leash" in the UK. How ironic.


                |It means leash here too in some situations...


                |only when used as a noun (and in context).


                |When I read that I imagined someone descended from William Randolph saying it over some red wine in his family'
                | New England mansion. Just sayin'. And no, America is not trying to put a leash on anyone.


            |The two terms aren't, of course, mutually exclusive. There are, according to Wikipedia, 1.57 billion Muslims. If yo
            | take 'the West' to be the whole continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Australia, that's about 1.
            | billion people. The problem is there's no commonly accepted definition of 'the West'.


                |LOL @ your straw man. Nice try. You know exactly what I mean, and you're just playing word games for the sake o
                | argument (or you're ignorant).

        |postasy in Egypt (84% of respondents in favor of death penalty), Jordan (86% in favor), ...  **Pakistan (76% favor)** a
        |d Nigeria (51% in favor).


            |76% of Pakistanis favour the death penalty for those leaving Islam. ////Incredible. ////I think those defending Isl
            |m in this thread reveal themselves to be projecting western views and ideas onto a society that doesn't understand 
            |hem. I have travelled in seven Muslim-majority countries (from Morocco to Jordan to Iran to Indonesia) and have a b
            |oad, generalised insight into the modern Muslim mind. They are, as individuals, obviously, as nice and friendly as 
            |nyone anywhere. But culturally they are primitive, intolerant and averse to minorities (be they gay, Jewish, aposta
            |es or whatever).////I always get the feeling that the people most aggressively defending Muslims from alleged 'raci
            |t' slurs on reddit haven't travelled very much, certainly not to the Islamosphere. 


    |This gives me hope for the future.    The only way to stop Islamic extremists/terrorists is for muslims themselves to stand
    |up against it, against Imams who preach it and recruit for it.    Noone else can end that particular brand of madness.//


    |why did they have to?


        |They didnt have to. ////I think it was sort of in remembrance of the bombing of a Christian Church in Pakistan which sh
        |cked the nation.


        |This was in response to the earlier [Peshawar church bombing](http://dawn.com/news/1044846/death-toll-from-peshawar-chu
        |ch-bombing-rises-to-81) back in September.


        |Yeah..... they weren't actively protecting it against anything.  The article explains that it was a demonstration of so
        |idarity (in light of the attack that Strider96 mentioned).  The "protecting" and "acting as a shield" stuff is pretty s
        |nsationalized.  You're still free to circlejerk with everyone who didn't RTFA, though!


        |Muslims.


            |you get it


    |this made my morning. maybe humanity has a chance after all


    |Although the majority of reddit is atheist, I doubt any realize the importance of religions freedom and helping your fellow
    |man. This story has both wonderful sides of humanity


        |&gt;has both sides of humanity////Fix'd 


    |wasn't there a story similar to this a while back where christian protestors formed a human chain around muslims in their p
    |otect group while they prayed?


    |This is really inspiring. I really do hope the middle east can straighten up during my lifetime, it seems that people are f
    |nally rising up to the oppression. 


        |Errr, not to be rude but just thought I'd clarify something. Pakistan's part of South Asia. It is sometimes included in
        |what is called the greater Middle East but not in the traditional view of which countries comprise the Middle East. So 
        |f you're arguing semantics, South Asia would be the more appropriate placement. 


    |This made me so happy. Not much religion news does that often.


    |And it was working just fine, until the extremists formed a human chain as well and started playing red rover red rover. 


    |Maybe, just maybe "look at these Muslims defending Christians from other Muslims" is really just confirming the stereotype 
    |s much as it's disproving it. ////Big round of applause to the people of Lahore though.


    |It is really nice to see that there are still people like these guys.


    |This is awesome! If only more of the world could respect other religions.


    |Good news. 


    |What nice guys. :)


    |We have a song in our country which translates like this: "Man created religions, Religions created Gods. Man, Religion and
    |God together splitted the lands". Wondering when we will recognize that Loving each other is the way to peace and bombing a
    |church or mosque is not the way...


    |I hope peace in the middle east and everywhere can be accomplished one day//and //.//.//.//middle-eastern girls are so pret
    |y! &lt;3//


    |The very fact they have to do this shows how fucked up all of it is.


    |I like to believe that in every religion, as the young move in, and the old farts with their unshakable prejudices die off,
    |the world will see the end of religion-based crimes against humanity. ////This story warms the heart so.


        |That's the problem though in many cases the older men on these extremist sects recruit and basically brainwash younger 
        |eople so their legacy of psychosis and hate can be carried on. But I agree seeing stories like this brings hope for cha
        |ge in the future.


    |Faith in humanity = Restored


    |I love this stuff. There are so many good people in the world. It is moments like this that keep people fighting for what i
    | right. This is very moving. 


    |how many people in pakistan speak english?


        |Does that even matter.


    |+1 for humanity good news


    |These are the Muslims who deserve headlines.


        |Not really. Being a decent human being isn't something that should be praised. It should be the most common thing there
        |is.


            |Humanity should be praised in place where there is almost none. 


                |Ok that was good.


    |Coexistence


    |Faith in humanity restored a little :) Thank you majority of muslims - for showing the world that not everyone in your reli
    |ion is a terrorist. Sometimes, the west needs reminding of that!


        |No it doesn't. Idiots need to be reminded of that.


    |humans are awesome


    |Funny, just last week everyone was furiously circle jerking over how horrible all Islamic people were. I got downvoted to o
    |livion for saying they were being Islamophobic.


    |Who cares if muslims are protecting christians or vice versa? It's not their religious beliefs that are important, it's the
    |fact that humans are protecting humans against fanatics


        |It matters because it is in stark contrast to ideas vehiculated by parts of the media (and held by many people) that mu
        |lims are in league with the terrorists, and that whilst they don't all take up arms, most secretly want them to win. //
        |/EDIT: Assuming there's any blood in their book, because I haven't read that one. But I'd assume they have the old test
        |ment somewhere in there...


            |What I want to see is media who do not see the "news value" in things like muslims protecting christians – the cont
            |ast is the normal state of muslims killing or ignoring christians alltogether –. I want to see media that reports n
            |utrally of both good stuff and bad stuff, a balance and a larger diversity which undermines stereotypes. 


                |I'm OK with media highlighting the good that people can do for each other, especially when it goes against the 
                |arrative that too much of the media has been selling.


    |faith in humanity strengthened :-)


        |wait to the next news cycle ............


    |This is the kind of story that makes me happy, but I wonder if it would be the same for people without a religion.


        |I am not religious at all (but support freedom of religion vehemently), and this story makes me very happy. There is go
        |d and bad in every group of people and this is the good we are seeing here.


        |Yeah. Without religion there would still e violence.


        |This story makes me rather sad, as it shouldn't be necessary to protect people for them to practice their (lack of) rel
        |gion.


            |There are stupid people everywhere. In general, people need to be protected from them, whether that's done by the p
            |lice or by community members doesn't matter as long as it gets done. Since the police in Pakistan is NOTORIOUSLY us
            |less and corrupt (bribery is like breathing there) the community is frequently forced to take protection into its o
            |n hands. Honestly, if any city needed a masked vigilante, it's (insert any Pakistani city).//As a side note, briber
            | is a major sin in Islam. Just goes to show you how "Islamic" the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is.


    |There are crazies in all religious groups.  You have extremist Muslims just like you have extremist Christians and extremis
    | Jews and maybe even extremist Buddhists ( I suppose it's possible.)   In the same way there are good, rational, caring Mus
    |ims as there are in other groups.  ////The point is you cannot judge a whole by the actions of a few and that is exactly wh
    |t people who vilify the Muslim religion are doing.  I myself am not a Muslim or Christian or anything for that matter, but 
    | do believe that in general people are good and will be good and do good if given the opportunity, but every group has thos
    | who would encourage violence and hate and they are warmongers.  ////


        |It is possible to have extreme buddhists. Buddhists are killing muslims in Burma. No religion is free from the monstros
        |ty that is humanity. Anybody can deform ANY religion or ideology for his own cause.


            |Right, that's why I didn't exclude them for that exact reason.  I think that any religion is capable of horrible th
            |ngs.
