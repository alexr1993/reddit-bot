Ex-atheists of reddit, why did you change your beliefs?(/r/Ask Reddit...)




    |Since most of the top comments aren't relevant I'll put my experience in.////I grew up in an atheist household, with my par
    |nts not doing anything religious, but they always kept me quite open minded when I grew up about religion. In my mid-teens 
    | converted to Buddhism. Its hard to explain why, It just kind of meshed with me, I could get behind all the beliefs and the
    |more I read, the more I agreed. When learning about Buddhism, it very much started out very simple, it starts of with some 
    |ery basic stuff, that didn't seem unlikely to me, rather than talking about a god, it started talking about the nature of t
    |e life, in a manner I agreed with. 


        |As a Christian who started studying Buddhism also I can see why you meshed with it. You don't find any of the floods, p
        |agues, genocides but you do find a lot of "this is how the world works, this is how to make the best of it." Very factu
        |l and not much need of interpretation and since beginning my readings I've found myself to be much happier with life an
        | at peace with things.


            |I enjoy eastern religions in general because it tends to be more, "Here's how we say you should live your life; we 
            |an't force you but we think it's within your best interests."  I can deal with that.  I can't deal with being calle
            | a sodomite and sinner for not being Christian.  Hell, I accept the title "sinner" with open arms now. 


                |I think this is a problem with people in Christianity more than Christianity itself.  So many love to forget, "
                |et he who has not sinned be the first to throw a stone".////I don't think you're a sodomite or a sinner for not
                |being Christian. I know I am a sinner, even if I am Christian. And who am I to judge you, when I too sin?////An
                |ways, that's just my opinion on it.


                    |To me, the problem with Western religion is that it's become institutionalized to such a perverse degree th
                    |t the religion operates as an organization with enough power and influence to enforce an agenda that fundam
                    |ntally ends up oppressing others. ////Western religion demands redemption for the sin of being human - some
                    |hing I do not agree with the tiniest bit. Eastern religion on the other hand lays out guidelines that allow
                    |for societal, natural, and inner harmony (Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism respectively) given what we kn
                    |w about the world and not based on a book that is just a spinoff of ancient Egyptian cosmology.////EDIT: fi

                        |Confucianism is often lumped in with feudal oppression of the Chinese people, what with its deference t
                        | authority and to elders being it's crowning value.


                            |Yes but Confucianism also states that the royal mandate can and naturally will be taken from the ru

                            |. Reciprocity (shu), otherwise known as the "golden rule" is one of the keystones of Confucianism a

                            |But when that happened, Daoism and Buddhism intervened to a certain degree. Same thing when Buddhis
                            | became dominant and started suppressing Daoism (those two have had some arguments), and vice versa
                            | ////In Europe you just had Christianity (Roman Catholicism), growing in power, and paganism, being
                            |on the defensive usually, and pretty much killed of nowadays. Islam ain't much different. In additi
                            |n they have both clashed with each other more often than not. ////I'm sorry to say, after studying 
                            |eligons and their histories at university for quite a few years, I don't particularily respect the 
                            |brahimic religions as much anymore: every religion has some bad apples and therefore some skeletons
                            |hidden away, but Christianity and Islam seem to cater more to people with closets, if you catch my 
                            |rift. //


                        |I agree with your first point. In the UK we recently had the Church of England campaign against gay mar
                        |iage. In the Catholic world the Catholic Church take a moral and political stance on many social issues
                        | In the US there are many large well-funded churches that fund and organise umbrella groups that public
                        |y campaign on social issues. I struggle to find an far-Eastern religious equivalent.


                            |Well it works the other way around in the East often. Instead of the church influencing the state, 
                            |he state influences the church. The Chinese government in the past few years has been playing up Co
                            |fucianism as justification for blind deference to the state's authority, for example. It's easy to 
                            |ay things are "better" where things are different, but they are simply different, not better or wor

                        |Depends on the sect of Christianity. They aren't all the same. I'm not religious but all of the Christi

                        |Your comment fails to do justice to western religion on so many levels.  It represent a gross oversimpl

                        |*Christianity* requires redemption and an emphasis on belief. Islam is way more about behavior. Judaism
                        |is mostly about behavior plus a little subtle ancestor worship. ////I think one reason the "atheists" o
                        | Reddit annoy the non-Christian people here who have religions is that a lot of the so-called atheists 
                        |ere are just agnostics or nature worshippers who are turned off by Christianity, or specific over-the-t
                        |p Protestant denominations, not really totally free from belief in spiritual forces. And a lot of the s

                        |worship doesn't necessarily have anything to do with spiritual beliefs. ////I think being evangelistic

                        |I agree with you, however after travelling to Asia it's clear eastern religions aren't exempt from bein
                        | institutionalized. If you learn about Buddhism in America, you're probably reading Buddhist texts. Ove
                        | in Asia where Buddhism is practiced you'll find very few people reading texts and more just worshiping
                        |idols, living superstitious lives and donating to their temples, similar to how Christianity is practic
                        |d in the US. 


                        |Eastern religions are also often tied with oppression. Buddhists, Muslims, and Hindus have all made war
                        |with each other plenty through the ages. 


                        |Not Judaism. Jews believe if you are a good person you will go to heaven. You do not need to convert, o
                        | be "saved" or go through any type of redemption.


                        |Buddhism is just as institutionalized in Eastern countries, and that cause problems there, see e.g. Mus
                        |ims in Thailand. Studying Buddhism in the west allows us to experienced the good side of that system of
                        |thought without seeing the institutional aspect.


                        |Fuck. I wish I had the money to give you gold. You hit the nail on the head.


                        |Christianity, at least, (I can't speak for other religion) does not "demand redemption for the sin of b
                        |ing human", because there's no teaching that says being human is a sin.////When Adam and Eve sinned, th
                        |y weren't simply responsible for themselves, they were responsible for the entire world for millenia to
                        |come. They messed up, and made the world imperfect. Original sin is not our fault, but that doesn't mea
                        | it doesn't exist. Be careful not to reject something just because it sounds harsh.


                            |I believe he was using hyperbole when he said "the sin of being human," and not being literal. I th
                            |nk he is referring to how so many things that are natural to humanity are considered sins to Christ
                            |anity, to the point where they force you to suppress a large part of what makes you human.


                            |Of course original sin doesn't exist. It's just one version of a creation story and only exists in 
                            |hat story because that God chose it to be that way.

                        |u can't repeat that sin again. It seems reasonable to think that more people only steal once than have

                        | with - from a Christian standpoint - is that it's fine to be homosexual but not to commit homosexual a
                        |ts because that would be having sex "not the way God intended." Granted, anal sex between a heterosexua
                        | couple would be wrong in the same way as well. If anything, if a homosexual person has the urges and t
                        |ndencies but can suppress them for the sake of their religion/god, then all the better he is for making

                                    |ts. Our ideas of the sanctity of marriage have changed with the changes in society. While I

                                    |are so many old dead guys' opinions stemming from millennia old cultures that it would be d

                                        |I can understand that, for example in leviticus, life was different back then. Their st

                                        |mines any claim that the Christian God has any objective sense of morality. God has man

                                        |it to stop people killing homosexuals? Doesn't really make any sense. Or else, he doesn
                                        |t have a perfect sense of morality and his views of what is right and wrong have change
                                        | just like the rest of ours. In which case he is not perfect.//// I think the latter is
                                        |most likely, because I believe God to be a man-made construct and thus his views reflec

                            |Other religions also tell me I'll go to hell if I don't bow down to their god.

                |As an atheist, I can certainly identify with the whole ancestor worship religions from the east and the western
                |pagan religions. Worshipping something that is physical or was physical is something that I can understand. 


                |Also the parameters that Christian bibles set such as you're a sinner if you jerk off. Or take the name in vain
                | Kinda unrelated, but were people already saying Jesus Christ or God Damn even back then? 


                |Part of that perspective is coming from a western perspective (most likely) looking eastward to the religions f
                |und there. If you lived in the system, you'd probably at least have a different perspective on it. Eastern reli
                |ions brought westward are often times cherry picked for ideas and teachings that would be successful, while wes
                |ern religions do the same when they evangelize their beliefs in other countries.


                    |I've read Siddhartha Gautama.  He's got some fire and brimstone type speeches but not too many. 


                        |Yes, but you also have to look at the systems and people that build up around these teachings. Just lik

                        |t, and they have their own objectives and desires.


                            |Another nice thing about Buddhism; everyone's path to enlightenment is individual. 


                                |To an extent, just like everyone's path to god is individual, but there are certain things you

                |I think it's more to do with how Christianity and Muslim religions have probably evolved in times of economic s

                |It's important to note that this is the face of eastern religions we more often see. It's easier to find this f
                |ce there than in western faith, but historically (and certainly currently) you can find a lot of the problems y
                |u have with christians in the east. Buddhist's are currently oppressing muslims in Burma and Christians were hi
                |torically oppressed in Japan (for really good political reasons, however). It's not about the religion, it's ab
                |ut the convert.


                    |Japan's problems with Christians isn't really about Buddhism, it's more Japan's massive cultural conservati
                    |m. 


                        |That and Japan's political system had a lot to do with the emperor's divine nature (i think this was al
                        |o before the shogunate's, exacerbating that issue). Buddhism didn't threaten that, but Christianity was
                        |viewed as a means to subvert the Emperor's authority and I believe that this was not at all lost on the
                        |missionaries or the western rulers who sent them over there.


            |Meshed. I like that phrase, I grew up Christian (very relaxed though, not really practicing). Became Atheist in Col
            |ege, then converted to Buddhism after taking several World Philosophy classes. Everything I learned about Buddhism 
            |eemed to click with what I believe, but not been able to express with words.


                |Buddhism seems hard to hate. Even if it says something that cuts at you a little bit, you know its the truth an
                | its the way to move and become better. As a matter of fact, the day I started studying it seems like a started
                |on a path to gradually becoming a better and better person. For me, the Bible gave me a template of what I shou
                |d be and Buddhism showed me how to get there.


            |It also actively discourages blind faith. You are actually practicing an element of the religion by challenging an 
            |lement of the religion.////The only thing i really dont like about ~~religion~~ Buddhism is the reincarnation thing
            | While it encourages you to be a better person, to get karma for your next reincarnation, it also implicitly enforc
            |s an acceptance of social standing eg. the king is the king because he deserves it, you're not because you dont. Yo
            |'re poor because you deserve it etc.////edit: buddhism, not religion.


                |Think about it like turns at checkers. Last turn you lost your King piece and 2 pawns in a triple-jump. This tu
                |n you must do the best you can without those pieces and maybe you can reclaim a new king piece for the next tur
                |.////It's more of a do the best you can with the position you've been given. This is where Christianity comes i
                |to play too. Sometimes you are put into a bad position to serve a purpose. He wants you to be strong and overco
                |e whatever obstacles you need to in order to serve your purpose. ////God put me in a position where I wanted a

                |and I talked a guy out of suicide (though I didn't know it) just by being peaceful and friendly. I still didn't
                |get a new job but I got a raise and a bonus because the customer came in and said something (only reason we fou
                |d out).////TL;DR you can't always control the cards you're dealt just play them the best you can and be peacefu
                | with your fellow man.  


                    |Oh yeah, of course. Sorry i just realized i said 'religion' when i meant 'buddhism'. I get the whole do the
                    |best with what you've got, etc.////What i find unsettling is the element of social control; the reigns of o
                    |ganized religion have generally been held by the upper crust, and almost all major religions have been used
                    |in one way or another to control and reinforce the social hierachy, from the divine right of kings to women
                    | rights. In the case of buddhism, of course you can try to improve your lot, and at the same time hopefully
                    |gain karma; but if you remove the idea that the rich deserve what they have for religious reasons, the soci
                    |l disparity becomes, well... extremely unfair, and peasants may consider a revolt.


                        |I see what you mean, I'm not sure if I buy into reincarnation so I can't speak too much on it. I also d
                        | buy into any of the social disparities. Keep in mind humans err; so any human translations or writing 
                        |f God's law/plan/etc. are destined to have error also. So I take everything I read with a grain of salt
                        |and think about what a loving and peaceful God would want. That being said, I try to treat everyone in 
                        |n equal brotherly/sisterly kinda way.


                |I think your understanding of reincarnation is more based on the hinduism view, which tends to look at reincarn
                |tion as more of a stairway, where if you do well in this life, you are rewarded by being born into a higher cas
                |e in the next.  Buddhism doesn't offer such a reward.  Instead, of being a ladder, reincarnation is more of a c
                |cle meant to purify your soul of suffering until you reach enlightenment.  ////AFAIK, there's no reward of bein
                | born into a better social class, and the emphasis is on doing the best with what you're given regardless of th
                | circumstances of your birth. //////Disclaimer: I'm not an expert in eastern religions, though I have done some
                |reading on the subject, so my view may be incomplete.  Anyone who has a more thorough background on this please

                    |Ah yes, that sounds likely. Im no expert on buddhism, and most countries i've been where its practiced on a
                    |large scale seem to have very different ideas, so im not really sure. Your description of hindu reincarnati
                    |n sounds more in line with what i thought it was about :)


            |I'm interested to know how your beliefs went from Buddhism to Christianity.//I would say im somewhat an Agnostic be
            |ief but have been looking into various religions; Buddhism is the one that I feel appeals most to me (or has the mo
            |t elements I can agree with).//I'm trying really hard to understand the views of Christianity as quite a lot of my 
            |amily and friends are; however, the more I try to understand it, the more sceptical i am. 


            |Because of your comment I think I will look more into Buddhism.  This sounds interesting, and to be honest, I reall
            | want something fulfilling since I lost my life-long belief in Christianity a few years ago. 


                |Sorry to hear you lost your faith in Christianity. May I ask what caused it?////Glad I can inspire, brother. I 
                |ully believe that a balance of Science, Buddhism, and Christianity leads to well understood, happy, and fulfill

                    |I'm not fully sure what caused it. I finally realized one day that I had been fooling myself for over a yea
                    |, pretending I believed in God when I really didn't. It was pretty devastating. I think an anthropology cou
                    |se I took helped open my mind, lots of religious debates with atheists and Pagans began to show me a few lo
                    |ic flaws, and no straight answers on a few topics like homosexuality from pastors were all factors. //I wou
                    |d like to believe in something that gives me meaning though, even if it's not a god, and rather a way of th

                        |To Atheists, Deist, and Theists alike I recommend [The Language of God](http://www.goodreads.com/book/s
                        |ow/35506.The_Language_of_God) by Francis S. Collins. He also has a [seminar](http://www.youtube.com/wat

                        | you can find something form this. I think you it will give you that feeling of something real to belie

            |Buddhism is a good therapy but the problem is that while the message of detachment is good it leaves one with nothi

                    |I think you'd really like "Easy Essays" by Peter Maurin, [it's available for free online.](http://www.catho

                        |Actually this looks like this could be a good read for a while. Thank you. 


                            |You're welcome. It changed my worldview forever.


            |Buddhism is not a religion. Its a way of life. Anyone studying Buddha would know this.


                |True but religion is a person's way of coming to God. In the way I use it Buddhism IS my religion along with Ch
                |istianity. Though, I respect your technicality and I will note that in future discussions about Buddhism.


            |What's your book recommendation on Buddhism? 


                |[This.](http://www.abebooks.com/Heart-Buddhas-Teaching-Thich-Nhat-Hanh/11150644023/bd?cm_mmc=gmc-_-gmc-_-PLA-_-

                |beginner though.


            |Stupid question, where can you find readings for Buddhism? 


                |[Buddhist Texts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_texts) or [this book I started with](http://www.abebooks

            |Do be fair, we don't get the Buddhism on the ground, we get the philosophies transmitted by the writers.  It's just
            |as disparate in application as the Christian texts and the Latin American version of Catholicism.  But over-all it 
            |s more pleasant.


                |Plus there are only two real main variations (from my understanding) whereas Christianity has many more sects.

        |Thanks for sharing your experience. Do you believe in a god, though? You can be Buddhist and remain agnostic or atheist
        |as regards deities. I quite like Buddhism myself - I was at an open day of a temple yesterday. I'll be going back. Cool
        |people.


            |Traditional Buddhism believes in gods, but believes that they are mortal (just incredibly long lived) and a part of
            |the cycle of birth and rebirth.  //


                |I understand that some incorporated local deities as Buddhism spread (Japanese, and Chinese folklore especially

                    |What about impossibly old people demigods sounds believable to a Buddhist?


                        |Buddhism places a strong focus on the positive effect a life can have on the universe. It would be fair
                        |to say, in simplified terms, that this is an analogy for those who most drastically influence the world
                        |and their lasting impact.


                            |Is Buddhism comfortable saying that its stories about super old demigods are just instructive myths


                                |I can't answer that question for Buddhism. Most reasonable Buddhists, along with most reasonabl
                                | Christians, seem comfortable saying that the stories laid out in their respective texts are no

                                    |There are not many reasonable Christians who take seriously their religious precepts, as mo
                                    |t of their foundational myths are so at odds with science (men living to 900+ years, contra
                                    |ictory creation accounts, young earth, global flood) that they are forced to interpret it a
                                    | myth. This is not a modern interpretation. This view concedes that the original, literal u
                                    |derstanding of their beliefs is wrong. That is not a position most Christians are comfortab
                                    |e admitting.


                                        |True, but then I am not friends with nor do I have a conversation about religion with m
                                        |st Christians.  My anecdotal evidence simply suggests there are quite a few Christians 
                                        |ho are comfortable with admitting the literal understanding of the Bible can not apply 
                                        |o humanity and society today.


                                            |Are there quite a few as a gross number? Yes. But as a percentage of Christians, it
                                            |is few. There are a number of passages that in the Bible that claim they *must* be 
                                            |elieved, and to write them off as poetic fiction is to risk a fiction of a more fie
                                            |y sort. That makes being a reasonable Christian a bit more difficult.


                |It depends on which sect you're referring too. Buddhism has about as many sects as christianity does. Mahayana 
                |uddhism has many gods.


                    |But they are mortal, so not gods in the western sense 


                    |I should have clarified.  By traditional Buddhism, I meant Theravada.  I am, sadly, less informed about Mah
                    |yana sects.  Although I read briefly on one who believes that belief is erroneous.  I imagine it causes som
                    | doctrinal issues.  


                    |He said traditional Buddhism.


                        |That's a very hard thing to pin point on since "traditional" Buddhism was forced out of it's country of
                        |origin.


                        |There isn't really a "traditional" Buddhism. After the Buddha's death Buddhism split into Theravada and
                        |Mahayana Buddhism each with very different views on enlightenment and practices.  Theravada only uses t
                        |e Pali canon which is to say those teachings/sayings that they attribute to the Buddha (in this way the
                        | claim to be "traditional" Buddhism).  Theravada also purposes that the only real way to enlightenment 
                        |s through monastic life, and while there can be lay believers they don't (from my understanding) reach 
                        |nlightenment.  ////Meanwhile Mahayana is much more about the lay people and helping them to reach an en
                        | to reincarnation.  They put the focus on getting to the point of Nirvana and then coming back to teach
                        |others about it and help rescue them.  There are still monasteries but it's not the focus of the Mahaya
                        |a sects.  Mahayana sects also incorporate Buddhist texts other than the Pali canon into their teachings
                        |  ////Both Theravada and Mahayana have many sects , some with many Gods and some with no Gods.  For ins
                        |ance Tibetan Buddhism (and I'm generalizing here) has Gods and, as /u/ElDochart said, they are mortal a
                        |d subject to karma and the cycle of death and rebirth. However Zen (generalizing again) doesn't have Go
                        |s. Yet they are both part of the Mahayana tradition. ////TL;DR From my understanding traditional Buddhi
                        |m doesn't exist.  


                            |You forgot the third one, Vajrayana. 


                                |Vajrayana is tibetan buddhism. 


                                    |Vajrayana isn't originally Tibetan, and it absolutely is a third spoke, not just Tibet's Ma

                        |Mahayana is actually more "traditional" at this point in history than Theravada.


                |That brith/re-birth thing is the stuff I can't reconcile in Buddhism.  Other than that, it's my favorite religi
                |n (still staunchly agnostically atheistic).


                    |I think the intent of the Buddha from what I can gather from his teachings was to always question everythin
                    |, including concepts like rebirth. Sounds like you're doing it just right!////I have never had any personal
                    |experiences or states of mind that have revealed any "evidence" that rebirth really is "a thing." Because o
                    | this I am unable to say that I truly "believe" in it. However, it fits in very well with my belief/underst
                    |nding of the way things work as a result of my experiences, questioning and skepticism. 


                        |Very true. When asked about these concepts, Buddha told a follower of his that he didn't have all the a
                        |swers and to find out for themselves.


                    |You probably don't understand birth/rebirth the way the Buddha used it.


                    |I have an interest in buddhism and am still a novice. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that the birth
                    |re-birth has to do with the idea of oneness. After death, the body returns to earth (through decay and brea
                    | down) and from the earth (in a long elaborate process) people are "re-born". I might be looking into it to
                    | hard or trying to make it scientific, but that's my general understanding.


                        |That is very much a modern Western interpretation of rebirth. In original Buddhism there is no talk of 
                        |neness at all.


                            |Oneness is of course a very central aspect of Hinduism, which probably leads to some confusion. And
                            |is absolutely understandable given the other similarities between the two religions/culturals. 


                            |But there is talk of there being no self which would seem to run counter to the notion of separatio
                            |.


                    |But aren't you either reborn into this world or the world of the gods, depending on your karma? 


                        |Depending on how you lived your life*.////But you can also achieve what Buddhists aim for - becoming "O
                        |e with All", a Boddhisattva, who broke from the cycle and no longer is in Samsara.

                |True - It wasn't until Buddhism spread particularly east that Buddha became a reincarnation of Vishnu. 


                    |I believe thats only a part of Mahayana Buddhism.  They tend to embrace a more mystical outlook.  


                |As far as I've been taught buddhism, they're not gods. They're Bodhisattvas, as in those who attained buddhahoo
                | after Buddha. They've escaped the cycle of birth and rebirth because theyve achieved nirvana.////Buddhists sti
                |l pray to them though.


                    |Gods are gods, and bodhis are bodhis.  Bodhisattvas are those who have obtained enlightenment, and chose to
                    |return to life to teach instead of accepting nirvana.  Gods, at least in the traditional Theravada sense, a
                    |e a part of the realm of experience, and are mortal.  They die and are reborn just like everything else.  B
                    |ddhism emerged from a region where  there were many different local gods, personal gods, and beliefs (which
                    |has turned into modern day Hinduism).  Just as Christianity incorporated Judaism, Buddhism was influenced s
                    |rongly by the local beliefs.  It would be possible to become a god, but Buddhism teaches that even so you w
                    |uld suffer and would still be trapped in the cycle.  ////


                |Traditional Buddhism is Theravada, the teaching of the elders. The oldest remaining Buddhist school that follow
                | the original the teaching of The Enlightened One. If I recall, there are like 31 different realms of existence
                |in which these supernaturals live. We humans live in the sensual world (# 5th of the ladder).//Which also puts 
                |e to the following. What kind of god is so desperate to be worshipped by lower beings?


                    |I should've specified, I am talking about Theravada.  6 realms, but I think they may be subdivided.  I'm re
                    |ching the end of my knowledge on the subject and don't want to risk misinforming anyone.  ////Its a good qu
                    |stion, I would say that as the gods are suffering, just like everyone else, they would suffer from the same
                    |phycological needs and issues.  


                |Devas not gods.


                    |It's a translation.  


                        |Should be demigods or angels then.


                |Would you care to elaborate on this. How long to the Gods live? How do they come into existence and how do they
                |die? 


                |So which Buddhism are we talking about? Mahayana or Theravada? Those are pretty different things. I grew up as 
                | Theravada buddhist and know that there's no long-lived gods in the world. If you're referring to spirits and "
                |ngels", yes some of them do live longer than humans. But they do not possess god-like powers to rule us all. So
                |e of them rule parts and pieces of the universe (some of them don't) like a guardian spirit of a forest, etc.//
                |/Also, as a side note: In Theravada Buddhism, we believe Gautama Buddha (the Buddha as everyone in the western 
                |orld knows it) lived to 80yrs and died (from weakness caused after diarrhea and old age). Before Gautama, there
                |were THREE other Buddhas in this world and those three Buddhas lived different numbers of years (some, I believ
                |, lived for thousands of years) before they died. Theravada scripture says those Buddhas lived average human li
                |espan of the era that they belong to (people's lifespan--according to the scripture--goes up and down between t
                |n to several thousand yrs).////Btw, I'm an atheist now. I still follow a lot of Buddhism's philosophy, but just
                |don't feel like I belong to the people who call themselves Buddhists.


                    |By gods, I meant Devas, a poor translation at best.  Maybe better described as heavenly beings.  


                |Most Buddhists I've met use the framework of traditional Buddhist beliefs as a means of examining the human con
                |ition, for which they are particularly well-suited among human religions. These Buddhists are also humanists, a

            |There is no God in Buddhism. There are figures in the religion but they tend be "regular" people who have attained

                |There are no gods in the sense of the western omnipotent notion of God.. But they're not just regular mortal pe
                |ple. There's a fine line here; once reaching enlightenment we do pass from this life into a non-corporeal essen
                |e. Some, however, do return as bodhisattva in order to help others do the same - prime examples being the  Dala
                | Lama and Panchen Lama who do return from heaven to earth. Then we have have all of the deities that are very c
                |mmonly powerful reincarnations of Avalokiteśvara but are celebrated and prayed to as celestial bodies for guida
                |ce. These are also bodhisattvas to make it more confusing. ////So.. Gods? Kind of. But definitely not just mort
                |l. But then you do have theravada Buddhism which does not celebrate this practice at all, albeit is not as perv
                |sive as Mahayana (mentioned above). 


                |There may not be gods in buddhism, but many Buddhists believe in gods and demons.


                |The interesting thing about Buddhism is that there are gods, many of them in fact, but there is no God. In Budd
                |ism the gods are subject to Samsara/cycle of rebirth just the same as humans. In Tibetan Buddhism at least, the
                |gods often go straight to hell after their time as gods because they exhaust all their good karma. I always tho
                |ght that was kind of cool. 


                |Buddhism came from Hindu. So, even though there may not be gods in all forms of Buddhism (ex. Zen), other forms
                |do. My lineage, Shambhala Buddhism, has deities if you go far enough up the totem poll. They aren't talked abou
                | to beginners, though. So, that's something. 


                |But Buddhism *is* very religious in nature, or can be, which a lot of people seem not to think. They have legen
                |s about the life and birth of the historical Buddha which are as religiously foreshadowing as the birth of Chri
                |t. Tradition say his mother gave a virgin birth, that she had a dream of a great elephant piercing her side the
                |night he was conceived, and that when he was born it was a painless birth.   ////Tradition states that when a g
                |vernment official was trying to convince the king to make Buddhism the state religion in Korea, the official en
                |ineered his martyrdom to prove his point with a miracle. When he was beheaded, the earth shook, flowers rained 
                |rom the sky, the sun went out, and milk instead of blood poured from his neck.


                |Buddhism basically shares the same cosmology as gnosticism, but with more emphasis on how to live life well and
                |break the cycle of reincarnation.


                |During the first 500 years, yes.////But as time passed, things got murkier. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinb

            |my stance on "God" is that i'm not sure if there is one, and if there is then he'll "judge" people on how good of a
            |person they were, not what religion they belonged to.//And if there's not, then i won't be alive to say, "well shit
            | i'll just be gone


            |I believe not in a deity per se, but in the concept of the Eternal Buddha. It is less a being and more just a force
            |that has existed since the beginning of time, which manifests itself in numerous ways but basically works for harmo
            |ization of all things. One aspect of it is the seed of Buddhahood that is part of all sentient beings. We all have 
            | Buddha nature which we must work to grow and manifest in our lives. All beings are destined for Buddhahood, for pe
            |fect oneness with the Eternal Buddha at some point in the future. And so I see it sort of as a process that is happ
            |ning always to everything.////So no, I don't believe in a god but rather in a divine will of the universe. but ther
            | are many different Buddhist scriptures with many interpretations.


            |&gt;I myself have read a great deal of theological reasoning about the existence of God, and it all starts out alon
            | this line: If you are intelligent and reasonable, you cannot be a product of a mechanical and meaningless universe
            | Figs do not grow on thistles, grapes do not grow on thorns; therefore you, as an expression of the universe, as an
            |aperture through which the universe is observing itself, cannot be a mere fluke.////&gt;Because if this world peopl
            |s, as trees bring forth fruit, then the universe itself - the energy which underlies it, what it is all about - mus
            | be intelligent.  //  //-Alan Watts


                |That's the "watchmaker" argument and Watts was by no means the first to make it. However, he has included a mis
                |epresentation of Natural Selection as well. I can respect (say) Newton, or [Payley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wik
                |/Watchmaker_analogy#William_Paley) making that argument: but post-Darwin, making the "fluke" argument is a pret
                |y bad mistake and shows very poor judgement.////Anyway: the "watchmaker" hypothesis actually raises more questi
                |ns than it answers (or rather makes the original question hugely more complex). If you accept it, then you have
                |to infer that the intelligence which created the universe predates the universe, *and* was complex enough to cr
                |ate the universe and guide the creation of complex life.////So far from simplifying things, it actually makes t
                |e same question much more complex: from where did that complex intelligence arise? Logically, it must have been
                |created by an even more complex intelligence (since intelligence itself cannot arise by chance, according to th
                | original argument). And so you disappear to infinity, with still no explanation at all of how anything started
                |- just ever-more increasingly complex intelligences that must have created each other.


            |No, you cannot. You can subscribe to a moral code (which I will point out everyone does already) that is similar to
            |that of Buddhism but unless you believe all the wacky shit that is in the Buddhist pantheon and stories, you aren't
            |really a Buddhist.


                |Atheism = lack of belief in gods.////[Many Buddhists are atheist](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddh
                |sm/ataglance/glance.shtml)////&gt; There is no belief in a personal god.////Though I understand that many do be

                |. The word has a [very specific meaning](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/atheist), but that does not include "

        |I was raised a cristian, started doubting the idea of a god while a teenager, but still had my spiritual side. I went t
        |e whole atheism route, Dawkins, Hitchens, /r/atheism... Later on I realized there's something good about religion, othe
        | than the whole obsession with god. Found out buddhism is receptive of me inspite of my belief in a deity and focus on 
        |hat really matters, our relationship with life itself. It's all about having a better life and working for the happines
        | of everyone. Not much of a convert, but more like discovering a name to something I've always agreed with. You may thi
        |k I'm atheist still, and to the dictionary definition I probably am, but the whole concept of atheism feels unimportant
        |to me now. The whole discussion feels empty of true meaningful changes.


            |I had much the same experience. Ironically now I find myself a very conservative Buddhist although I grew up in a m
            |re liberal Christian household.


            |Man, /r/atheism. That's a phase everyone needs to go through who's transitioning out of religion. Seriously though,
            |I couldn't get away faster from that subreddit. Instead of transitioning away peacefully, I transitioned with a lot
            |of building anger. And that just presented a whole new slew of issues.


                |I don't think anyone has to go through that crap. It would be far better for them to leave their baggage behind
                | realise that the problem was mainly with the people and just start fresh without hate.//


            |To be fair, as an athiest I find the style of Dawkins and Hitchens to be way too abrasive. I was surprised at the l
            |vel of rudeness I guess, that they pile on. /r/atheism is also too much, I tried to stay subscribed and downvote th
            | crap but it's too much and I unsubscribed. It has a lot in common with Dawkins and is even more emotional.////Full
            |ime atheists seem like televangelists. If you were looking for an atheist role model, it would have to be a scienti
            |t or someone else who actually does something useful. Like Neil DeGrasse Tyson, or Stephen Hawking.////Finally if y
            |u still had a spiritual side I wonder why you went atheist at all, much less with the crazy types.


        |Isn't Buddhism an atheist religion?


            |[deleted]


                |Deities, or "theities"? I could conceivably be a deist (under a broad enough interpretation),  but I'm definite
                |y an a*theist*. 


                |Mostly that's right, although [Pure Land Buddhism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Land_Buddhism) could be sa
                |d to find salvation in Amitabha Buddha.


            |Buddhism is atheist in the sense that it does not revolve around a god. There is still an afterlife (or series of t
            |em as you transmigrate the world through samsara, rather) and other elements of religion in it, but the idea of god
            |to be worshipped for blessing, power, or higher perception is an irrelevant one in Buddhism. Essentially, it rather
            |says that regardless of if there *is* or *is not* a god, one can attain enlightenment because of the Buddha nature 
            |ll sentient beings share. God just is not needed to attain Buddhist enlightenment. ////In Mahayana Buddhism there a
            |e a series of bodhisattvas and buddhas that could be viewed in the light of a deity. However, these are not fundame
            |tal to the teaching and thus it is still atheistic in god-practice.////TL;DR - God is more irrelvant than strictly 
            |on-existent in Buddhism.


            |atheist religion... you just made my brain hurt.  Sure, there are no gods, but there are LOADS of mystical harlotry
            |involved.


        |I, too, was raised by atheist and became a Buddhist after leaving home. It was a very gradual process that seemed like 
        | natural progression out my parents' atheist worldview, which I perceived to be pessimistic and cynical. 


        |Mahayana or Theravada?


        |Buddhism doesn't beleive in a god, it is about discovery by observation a good book to read is "what the Buddha taught"
        |by wapoa radula. There are many mystic sects of Buddhism that have in many ways drifted verry far from Buddhism. I am b
        |th a Christian and a Buddhist, I lived in a zen monastery for a period of time.  Pm me if you want to know more. I can 
        |end you a list of my reading material when I started at the monastery 


        |I've always told people that if I had a gun to my head and was forced to choose a religion, It would be Buddhism. It se
        |ms like the most balanced choice to me, an agnostic atheist.


        |I was thinking if I ever switched to a religion it would be Buddhism


        |What exactly does converting to buddhism entail? As I understand, only a few schools of buddhism accept lay-person "con
        |erts", and for most temples the only way to join is to be a monk.


        |I never got far enough into the minutiae to call myself a Buddhist, but the  teachings have always seemed profound, whe
        | I hear them it's like hearing something I already knew but couldn't quite articulate, I can sense the wisdom in the wo
        |ds. Particularly, how one ought to view his own thoughts, this alone has provided me with a tremendous amount of relief
        |and happiness.


        |do you consider buddhism a theistic religion?  steve jobs called it a philosophy, like taoism, rather than a religion


        |What sect to you ascribe to?


        |I can truly relate you've shared. But I always thought of Buddhism of a train of thought, not technically a religion.


        |Doesn't that make you a religious atheist, since Buddhism traditionally has no god?


        |Whats with all the downvotes? This is completely relevant and it isn't crude or offensive and any way


        |I'm really interested in Buddhism. I have found reading Buddhist texts to massively help me with depression. Can you re
        |ommend books I should read to get me into it?


        |Seems like Buddhism is like the "bacon" to vegans of religion. It always kinda meshes with everyone. I know I know terr
        |ble analogy. 


        |Take a look at the TED talk by brain scientist Jill Bolte Taylor. She had a stroke and got a really close look at her c
        |nsciousness. She reports back her experience, but it's pretty profound and will give you some stuff to think about. Als
        |, good luck with your service. I'm in awe of you young folks who sign up.


        |Also, depending on what branch you follow, buddism is almost a philosophy than a religion. 


    |I will answer this seriously and just ignore all the people telling me how I'm wrong. I grew up with a father who was raise
    | strictly Catholic and a mother whose parents were both atheists. My dad hated religion and my mom never knew it. In colleg
    | I took an architecture class on worship spaces, and we had to go to three different services to understand how the space r
    |lates to their beliefs and vice versa. One was a very small Quaker meetinghouse, and two people started talking to me after
    |the service. One was a woman born a Polish jew who survived the Holocaust because she had blonde hair and the family next d
    |or adopted her. Her parents and infant sister were killed. She told me that she believed that to her God is warmth, and tha
    | life may hold bigger secrets than we are willing to comprehend, but that our job while we are on this planet is to bring t
    |at warmth to this planet by practicing love, compassion and forgiveness. That was the moment I decided to seek out religion
    |for the first time, and I think it has really enriched my life.


        |For many atheists, most religion seems to be about how most people will be punished for eternity. ////But the answers h
        |re emphasize love.////Do you consider yourself to have a particular confession? Are you saying you don't spend any/much
        |time thinking about all the people your god will cause to suffer for eternity? ////Edit: Serious question. I quit /r/at
        |eism some time ago because of their fundamentalist intolerance of any suggestion that religion could be good for people
        | I believe that it can/is. Just wondering how you frame/think about the negative aspects of your religion (if, for exam
        |le, you identify as a Christian or other religion of the book).


            |It makes me sad. A lot of religious individuals misuse their beliefs to think they can be assholes and judge others
            | not just Atheists regarding religions. I look to Jesus as an example of what to be like. And He was a massively pe

            |I think religion can lead to good, obviously, but that doesn't make religion good. I think people are a bunch of cu

        |See I also think we should practice love compassion and forgiveness, but don't see why you need a god to do it :/


            |Every atheist I know is also a secular humanist. Love, dignity and human solidarity are not exclusive to religion,

    |raised an atheist in a very secular community, and didn't think much of religion when I was young. But when I was about 15

    |about what people believe. I remember one book explaining that believing in God made him a good and happy person, and that 
    |eing happy and good is the essence of humanity.////What I once thought were crazies living by an ancient code, were actuall
    | very smart people (well, some are). So I sought of questioned my own beliefs and ideas on the topic (and I was still going
    |through a very hard time), I slowly started to believe that there was a God, that there was a plan to everything. I always 
    |ondered why people believed in things like this, but it just made sense to me all of a sudden. To this day I still consider
    |myself a deist and often think about things like the afterlife and fate.

        |I used to think this way... and still do to a certain extent. Tons of evidence to back this stuff up. My favorite is th

        |us. The hypothesis is that, in this universe, everything is cause and effect (this is also why I don't believe in free 
        |ill) except for the beginning. Putting aside what actually happened at the beginning of the universe, *something* had t
        | happen. An "uncaused cause". Something happened at the beginning of the universe that didn't originate from our univer

            |You can't just say "not to be an ass" then be an ass. You are right though. When life is hardest, one of the most e

    |I constantly fight with myself over it. I don't believe there is a god but I hope there is one. My mind can't fathom just n

        |a few years ago I had to have surgery to repair my shoulder. Before hand I had to sign all the papers that say by the w
        |y, there's a small chance you will die while under anesthesia, so this was heavily on my mind while they were prepping 
        |e. They gave me something to relax me, and told me that they wanted me to be awake to put some kind of pump in my shoul
        |er.  Apparently I didn't listen. one second I was laying there watching them walk around me. the next I was cold. I had
        |some weight on my chest and it was dark. I was in recovery. I had no sense of time passing, no memories of what happene
        |. For all intents and purposes, I had ceased to exist, and I didn't know it. I didn't recognize the moment I was loosin
        | consciousness (and I realized I never do) I just, temporarily, ceased to be. It was only that I woke up that I was abl
        | to contemplate this. and I realized that if I died on the table, I never would have known it. I would have just ceased
        |to be and I wouldn't have been able to contemplate it later. This somehow grants me peace when I think about death. Som
        | day I'll be there, and simply slip into this deep sleep with no time or memories, I won't notice it, and I'll never be
        |able to contemplate it afterwards. Since I've already kind of did this, (at least I believe I have and that's all that'
        | really important anyway) it doesn't frighten me anymore. //


            |But this frightens me.


                |"I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffere

                | you ought to keep to yourself.


                    |This is a quote that really speaks to me


                    |That quote doesn't help me. I hate the billions of years I didn't exist before my birth almost as much as I
                    |hate the billions of years after my death. I simultaneously am supremely grateful for the short time I do g
                    |t and absolutely hate the enormous amount of time I don't.


                        |Why? Why be so concerned with things you have absolutely no control over? Why not loose yourself in the
                        |awe-inspiring nature of everything you CAN experience and DO have control over? You and I are capable o
                        | experiences and actions people only dreamed of a hundred years ago, of things people couldn't even con
                        |eive of a thousand years ago. Why does it matter you can't hang with them? You could immerse yourself i
                        | what's left of the civilization anyways, and figure out who they were, what they did, why they did it,
                        |how it pertains to us today... You could look at the stars and figure out ways to get there, to bring b
                        |ck rocks from places you could never visit... Just because you can't do it all doesn't mean your legacy
                        |can't be the stuff of legends. Just because you can't do it all does't mean that you can't enjoy every 
                        |ittle thing you can do. Every choice you make is precious and meaningful EXACTLY BECAUSE you only have 
                        | finite number of them.


                            |I absolutely agree with all of that...and I still hate my own mortality. For every thing I can do, 
                            |ee, or learn, there are a billion more than I never will. I'm not a thrill-seeker or anything, I ju

                    |That's a great quote.


                |And this is (one of the many reasons) why Religion exists. ////Humans are afraid of death because we can't comp
                |ehend that when we die there is simply nothing. It's nicer to believe that we get to be with our loved ones in 
                |ome eternal bliss rather then just ceasing to exist.////


                    |&gt; we can't comprehend that when we die there is simply nothing.////Strangely enough, for me it's the opp
                    |site. I am not religious because I can't comprehend anything *other* than nothingness after death, but I st
                    |ll don't fear it.


                        |I rather like the idea of being done. Knowing that when I die I'm not here anymore, but I'm not anywher
                        | anymore. I don't see how an afterlife can be that great. If people are themselves it's going to be jus
                        | like an eternal version of this fucked up world, but if they're "better versions" then they aren't rea
                        |ly themselves and the real person also disappeared like there was no afterlife. 


                            |Maybe this is why the concepts of heaven and hell were developed.  You are meant to believe that if
                            |you are good, you'll go to a place where there are only good people, and the afterlife will be grea
                            | forever.  (And who doesn't think that they, themselves, and the people they love, are good?  It's 
                            |erfect... everyone is led to believe that they will be going to the good place.)  If you're bad, yo
                            | go to a bad place with other bad people.  (And who thinks they, themselves, and those they love, a
                            |e bad?  Everyone is led to believe they'll go to the good place with their family while the guy tai
                            |gating them on the freeway and the guys who caused the economic meltdown will go to the bad place.)
                            | I don't think this is how it's actually portrayed in the Bible, but it's how a lot of people seem 
                            |o think it works.


                                |But nobody is purely good or bad. If you go to heaven and have the bad parts removed you aren't
                                |you. I've seen some of the nicest people I've known do some terrible things.


                                    |You and I agree, I hope I was clear enough in my comment.  But I don't think most people ar
                                    | willing to think as deeply about it as you or I.


                                        |I agree that most people do not think about it all that deeply, but not everyone that t
                                        |inks about it deeply comes to the same conclusion.


                                |I like this notion. We create our own heaven and hell based on our lives. Loving people think o
                                | loving things and create their afterlife to be heavenly, angry people think of hateful things 
                                |nd create their afterlife to be hellish. 


                            |Agreed. If death is the beginning of eternity, what makes life worth living? I figure if I've got t
                            |is one life that I should do good with what I've got, and since we only experience it once, make ev
                            |ry moment count. 


                            |I'm religious and I really like the idea of just being done, I just don't think that's what happens
                            |  But I relate to that sentiment.////In my religious tradition there are multiple places people go 
                            |fter, more or less sorting by how you lived.  You will also have the advantage of being free from a
                            |imal instincts and temptation.////Imagine being on Survivor, under the extreme strain of limited fo
                            |d and the stress of the game, then being back in the real world.  Doesn't mean the "real world you"
                            |isn't you and the Survivor you is "the real you".


                            |I like to think that when I die, I am no longer bound to this one place, this one experience that e
                            |ists within my body, but instead, the energy that flows within me is then free to flow throughout t
                            |e universe, and I am everywhere. I am everything and nothing. I am. 


                                |I love that the parts that I think of as me will spread and become parts of other amazing thing
                                |. 


                            |No it won't be. 99% of human behavior is motivated by scarcity. In a post-scarcity existence of unl
                            |mited resources, there is no reason for people to be bad.


                        |The comfort for me is that when I'm dead, I won't notice. I'm deathly afraid of being paralysed though


                            |As a motorcyclist, I don't fear dying in a wreck, but I would really rather not get paralyzed or lo
                            |e limbs or such.  Death is far less frightening than life (though it does get worrisome if you star
                            | overthinking it).


                        |No, it's not strange. That's why you're an atheist. Understanding and being at terms with reality negat
                        |s the need for beliefs that shield you from reality.


                            |I really think you're comment is elegant and quote worthy because this is essentially the fundament
                            |l reason why religion exists. 


                                |Not necessarily the reason some religions exist, but the reason they take some of the forms the
                                | do.


                                    |I'm confused. Can you provide me an example to distinguish both your points. Thanks.


                                        |I chose the word "some" on purpose, because I don't know enough about every sect of eve
                                        |y religion everywhere to have a conclusive opinion about all religions.////But I defini
                                        |ely feel many religions use theism combined with strategies of power stratification as 
                                        | means of controlling the populace and building a base of followers that will do as the
                                        |clergy demand.  Catholicism comes to mind.  Every Catholic is part of the strict hierar
                                        |hy, beginning at the top with the Pope, going down through the Cardinals and lesser Bis
                                        |ops down to the lowly layman.  Each level is responsible for answering to the level abo
                                        |e, with the Pope himself answering only to God.  Anyone - even those of other Christian
                                        |faiths, I would guess - can see that this places too much power in the hands of one man
                                        |(or a small group of men at the top, the Cardinals who vote in the Pope).  Many other r
                                        |ligions demand money or other sacrifice as a means of expressing piety.  This will star
                                        | getting too long if I keep going, but hopefully this gives you some idea of where I'm 
                                        |oming from on the first point.////So, to sum up, the reason some religions exist, in my
                                        |opinion, is to control people, to get them to behave how you want - always doing as you
                                        |say and providing you income.  (There are other reasons but this is a big one.)////The 
                                        |econd topic is the reason religions take the form they do.  If your goal is to control 
                                        |eople and you are simply transparent about it, who will choose to follow you?  Not many
                                        |people.  But what if you can lure them in with promises not only of being part of a gro
                                        |p (safety in numbers), providing you an explanation for things you don't understand (ex
                                        |laining the world as something you don't need to understand, just know that God(s) are 
                                        |oing it all), but also of providing you a relief from the fear of death by promising an
                                        |afterlife?  Now, people who are worried about such things and don't have better answers
                                        |for them will flock to you in droves.////To sum up all points, some religions exist to 
                                        |ontrol people, and take the forms they do because people won't come to follow a religio
                                        | unless they have an incentive.


                                            |You are jumping over my point.////Why is it that religion is capable of taking powe

                            |hat helped me is comparing it to the idea of immortality. For example, in The Lord of The Rings, th

                            |if there even is anything on the other side. Meanwhile, the Elves must live with every sorrow they 
                            |ave ever seen, forever. That's heavy. Eventually their burdens weigh them down so much they just ch

                    |That argument seems to me not to work, for the simple reason that being in a place and leaving it is differ

                            |You're talking there as though it is 100% certain that nothingness comes after death. I agree that

                            | nihilism to suggest otherwise.

                |worst part is you know the party hasn't ended, its just going to go on, without you (*or words to that effect*)
                |////I quite like the party too, I want it to go on and I dont want to leave.


                |This motivates me. You have one life, that is it.  In 100 years no one will remember your name.  So what do you
                |do?  You make the most out of the time you have because you know that is all the time you will get with the peo
                |le you love and the period of time you were born and exist in.  It makes life more valuable to know that every 
                |ime someone sacrifices their life, they don't respawn somewhere else, they are gone, they gave up their only pe
                |iod of existence for something.


                |Frightened me too before I went through anaesthesia. People compare it to sleep, but your brain isn't able to p
                |ocess dreams or thoughts or time under anaesthesia. You just wake up with a couple hours of life having not exi
                |ted. Its calming for some reason I can't explain.


                |Death is the complete lack of suffering.  Why should we fear it?


                |&gt; But this frightens me.////But why?   Do you feel frightened for all the people that haven't been born yet?
                | They are in the same state as people who have died.  Maybe instead of thinking of dead as an end, you could ju
                |t think of it as being un-born.////


                |It will continue to frighten you until you survive experiencing it. In life, we are conscious and sentient. We 
                |ave the powers to observe, to feel, to think, and to act. When that stops, you stop perceiving. Though you migh
                | fear death in life, that fear and emotional pain cannot persist through death.////There is some comfort to be 
                |ound in this, if you can believe it. Religion conditions many people to believe that there is perception after 
                |eath, and that perception can make you powerfully afraid of the uncertainty of death (because you strongly beli
                |ve that, whatever happens, you will have to deal with it *after* dying). If you hold this belief--and if it is 
                |ooted deep within your belief system--you will not ever overcome it until you've experienced death and have bee
                | revived to consider the experience. While states like sleep are commonly used to illustrate the "experience" o
                | death, there truly is no way describe or intimate the state of death using life experiences as parallels.////T
                |e vacuity of death is the kind of idea that can only be understood in abstract. If you can't appreciate what th
                | cessation of experience means for the way death might eventually affect you, you will continue to be afraid un
                |il you die, at which time you will not be, do, or feel anything. So go on--be afraid. It's part of life because
                |life is all you can know while you're alive.


            |It's possible that you were awake, but the doctors used a twilight anesthesia.  The main side effect of that being 
            |emporary amnesia.  So you could have been awake and (somewhat) coherent, but forgot about it when you came to.  Tha

                |Most surgeries are done that way any more.  Its advantageous to surgeons to be able to talk to you during a sur
                |ery.  Sometimes they'll ask you to hold something for them, giving them an extra hand.  Sometimes they'll ask y
                |u to wiggle something, move your arm or leg, or roll over.  Or ask you questions.  "Are you okay?  Does this hu
                |t?  Are you in any pain?". Etc...  I think it's also a lot safer than completely shutting your body down.////So
                |etimes I wonder if surgery is pure torture.  You're laying on the table, screaming in agony, strapped down and 
                |nable to move.  And afterwards they give you an amnesia drug so you don't remember any of it.  LOL


                |same here. My wife got mad at me because I kept waking up and asking the same questions over and over again.

                |I'm just "living" out the rest of my life as it would have been if I didn't die, as a ghost. 


            |Similar experience.  Was talking to the anesthesiologist, and the next thing I know I am being wheeled back to my r
            |om.  No time passed as far as I was concerned.  No pain, no memories, no dreams.  Just out and back in the blink of
            |an eye, when in fact I was under for 15 min or so.


                |Same. The dude told me "Ok how much anesthesia do you want?" - "Pff i don't know, you know" - "Ok, i'll start, 
                |ou tell me when to stop" - "ok"////Blacked out and woke up (cold as fuck).


            |A few years ago, I had surgery on my knee, had the same feeling, but I never put it into perspective like you did. 
            |nd now that you say it like this.. It kind of comforts me. 


            |This is what happened to me when I got my wisdom teeth out. It's such a weird experience, but almost calming.////Al

            |Thank you, this actually comforts me. 


            |As someone who dreads the concept of death and not existing, your story makes a lot of sense and brings comfort. //
            |/Something that I always think is that you were "dead" for millions of years before you were born, and I don't reme
            |ber it being that bad.////Here is a great quote by Epicurus, an ancient greek scholar - “Death is nothing to us, si
            |ce when we are, death has not come, and when death has come,we are not.”


            |Finally! Someone manages to express how I feel about dying, I've never been able to phrase it well. Good job!


            |I'm not scared of my end, but I worry about pain. I hope I go just like that, lights out.


            |This makes me think... Is this why some believe spirits dont realize their dead? Sorry I decided to talk about ghos
            |s, just had to ask.


            |Interesting, the scenario You describe scares the shit out of Me more than anything else.


                |Can you describe why it scares you instead if comforts you? Honest question? 


            |But isn't this simply your belief? Since you can't possibly know what happens when you die, you have faith in obliv
            |on?////Not trying to be a dick, honest question.


            |I totally get you. Thank you for sharing. ////But, it still frightens me. ////I don't think I'm alone here, either.
            |Life is so precious, and so short... some far more so than others. I love living... I don't want it to end.


            |See, I've had similar but opposite experiences. I'm a fainter, but I know exactly when it happens. My legs and fing
            |rs go numb, my vision starts to go dark. I have enough prep time to say "I'm going to faint now" and then I get rea
            |ly scared, brace myself, and faint. ////I'm scared that my death will be like *that*. The going numb kinda hurts, a
            |d the preparation for the fainting is scary. I can't imagine going into that knowing that I'm dying!


            |That's the way I look at it. Eventually you're gonna find out what happens when you die, and yeah I hope it isn't a
            |y time soon or excruciatingly painful or anything, but the certainty of it almost kinda grants you some freedom fro
            | the fear of it. Why worry so much over something you can't change?////I was put under when I got my wisdom teeth o
            |t and it's a strange experience. The loss of time and memory is just eerily complete. More so than with any substan
            |e I've done or sleep or even fainting.


            |Same with me! I was put under for an appendix that went gangreen (eww) and I thought they were going to be letting 
            |e count down to the event. I was actually really looking forward to the experience of just being there, and then no
            | being there. //So I got on the table and then was looking up at a doctor waiting for the signal to prepare myself 
            |or darkness and then I found myself viewing a foggy picture of Halo 3 characters coming into existence in my brain.
            |The image grew and grew in clarity until I woke up coughing from coming out of anesthesia. After I woke up fully I 
            |ealized that I got to experience just being here one moment, and then not being here the next. Time didn't exist. N
            |thing existed. I didn't even care. //It was truly amazing!


            |I had the exact same experience when i was under anethesia. The hours simply didn't exist, no feelings, no memory, 
            |o dreams, nothing. No perception of darkness or color, nothing. ////I'm convinced now that is exactly how death 'fe
            |ls', you will never realise you died in the first place. 


            |Do you experience any sort of purple void?


            |This sounds like an episode of Mad Men, like one of the early war flashbacks.//


            |I had a very similar experience when I was having my back surgery done it's crazy how there is nothing at all and i
            | kind of gave me peace of mind just like it did to you//


            |As someone who has struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life, I very much hope that death is just c
            |asing to exist. There is a calmness just thinking about it. The possibility of an afterlife or higher consciousness
            |just sounds like an opportunity for more anguish. That being said, I'm still afraid of death as it renders my exist
            |nce meaningless, even as I struggle to find meaning in my everyday life. I feel like I'm in a perpetual catch 22. 


            |Having been put under for an MRI (I would have not been able to stay still in there) it's like nothing happened aft
            |r the needle hit my arm and before I woke up and was given ginger ale. I really felt the same way after that, death
            |no longer scares me, but I'm still afraid of not living.


        |I think a lot of people believe for this reason. 


            |I agree completely all though most don't have the guts to admit they fear death over almost anything else. 


                |It's no coincidence that people tend to be more religious later in life. 


                    |Cramming before the finals...

                    |Or just when you realize how easily your life could be taken away. ////I was raised Catholic but as I becam
                    | a teen my family stopped going to church. My dad admitted to not being religious anymore to my siblings an
                    | me when he figured we were old enough to choose our own beliefs.  Even though he no longer believed, he st
                    |ll thought we should learn Catholicism as he did because he thought there were good morals to learn from it
                    |as a kid. ////Anyways... When I was 16, I found out I had a brain tumor. I decided to go to church every we

                    |After I had surgery and went through a couple months of radiation the tumor was gone. Then I decided I shou

                        |I was also raised Catholic, although I've drifted away from the Church. The one thing I will say is tha
                        | the parish I grew up in was extremely welcoming, accepting, and loving. Everyone knew everyone, and ev
                        |ryone looked out for each other. It was very involved in community service and we planned lots of non-r
                        |ligious activities for the community, too. Going back there to visit my parents always feels a bit like
                        |coming home. I've never felt unwelcomed or unwanted. It makes me realize why so many people are able to
                        |find such comfort in religion- the feeling of community is pretty amazing. I have yet to find that anyw

                            |See, but I don't even want to be conscious forever. Being a thinking, emotional conciousness for al

                |them.


                |Actually, the exact opposite here. I consider myself a Christian, but sometimes I wish I didn't believe because
                |the thought of an everlasting afterlife is utterly terrifying when you really sit and think about it.


                |Charlieissocoollike did a video recently about how his biggest fear is death because he feels there is no after
                |ife, just eternal unconsciousness. I'd link it, but I am on mobile////Edit: He's a youtuber


                    |I look him up thank you.


                |Interesting- it does require courage to admit to being fearful, which seems obvious but is sort of a strange id
                |a when you think about it- needing courage to admit you're afraid... That initial 'guts-nugget' might be good a

                    |I will sounds interesting. 


                |I think we fear death is because of the ideas of the after life; which leads to much stress in life when consid
                |ring,  for example,  Christianities reprocussions. I find it's comforting to perceive nothing exists after deat
                |.  


                    |I'm glad you can find that comforting.


            |Most people believe because they believe in an after life and since a few religions deal with after life with the h
            |aven/hell scenario, they're afraid.////If there was no mention of any hell anywhere, you wouldn't have as many peop
            |e fearing it (death), because ultimately death isn't so bad in a logical sense. You simply cease to exist...


            |I call it human arrogance; the refusal or fear of recognizing that we don't live forever. 


            |I'm a Christian and this is one of the main reasons I subscribe to Christianity is because I want to believe there 
            |s more after death. I talked to a preacher once because I felt bad and I felt like that was the only reason I had a
            |faith but he told me that that is not a thing to be ashamed of. God wants us in an afterlife with him so believing 
            |o that you can have an afterlife with him is nothing to be ashamed of.


                |Isn't this is a horrible reason though? Just because you fear something so much, you join something that promis
                |s you things that they cannot prove? This is how cults begin. You'll live more at peace actually facing those f
                |ars and accepting them. It gave me great peace of mind without subscribing to anything just because they promis
                | me to take away my fears based on nothing. 


                |Well, it's pretty fucking stupid.  It's like sticking your head in the sand or putting your hands in your ears 
                |nd shouting "la la la la la".  Reality doesn't change because you don't like it; if it makes you feel better, m
                |re power to you, but it's a grown adult playing fantasy, and inserting it into their lives.  I don't know what 
                |appens after death, and not existing scares the shit out of me, but that's life- I'd rather accept that fact th
                |t try to comfort myself with false platitudes.


                |&gt;  because I want to believe there is more after death.////reality doesn't care what you believe.////&gt;I t
                |lked to a preacher once ////There's your problem.


            |I completely agree with this. As a teenager raised in a semi-religious household, I have always tried to force myse
            |f to believe out of an innate fear of no longer existing. When I was 14 I finally accepted that at my current stage
            |in life I just wasn't capable of believing in something so seemingly impossible. Now I try to look forward to a fut
            |re me believing.


            |&gt; I think a lot of people don't believe in themselves for this reason. ////


            |I don't understand the "I want to believe and so I will" attitude. I just can't get over someone who knows there's 
            |o justifiable or logical reason to believe, but it feels nice so they do anyway.


            |I think there's a difference between believing and really hoping. //I think the comparison was: the guys who flew t
            |e plane into the towers; they truly believed.////You can convince yourself that you believe something. But I think 
            |t that point your just really hoping.////Belief really isn't a choice. I cant just wake up tomorrow and decide I'll
            |believe in god. Or the opposite, wake up and decide not to believe in god.


            |It sounds more like lying to yourself for comfort. Believing is not the same thing as wanting to believe.


            |I know the thought that a person's consciousness just ceases to exist when they're dead is scary but what makes me 
            |kay with it is realizing that I really am not even a mere speck in the vastness of the universe's history. I fear t
            |e dying part and the physical pain I might experience while dying but I don't fear death and what comes after my br
            |in stops working. Who the fuck am I to think I should matter after I'm dead and gone? Even the most famous figures 
            |n history don't matter in relation to the billions of years that the universe has been around or the countless othe
            | things happening on planets and in solar systems currently, and previously, in existence? Hitler and Osama bin Lad
            |n aren't  even a flea on the balls of a flea on the balls of another flea.////Yes, there are people who care about 
            |ou and will miss you when your body stops functioning but they're no more significant than you. Ashes to ashes, dus

            |et floating out here as one microscopic molecule of H2O in an entire ocean of water and silt and other things much 
            |igger than us. Even if we do end up colonizing on 2 or 3 or 4 other planets, we'd still only be 2 or 3 or 4 microsc

            |ld still enjoy your life as much as possible but we're still nothing compared to the vastness that we exist in. I j
            |st feel that thinking like you actually matter in the grand scheme of things is a bit arrogant.


            |More like MOST of them believe for this reason. Fear. They fear the thought of there not being an afterlife, so the
            | substitute their lack of knowledge with a man in the clouds.//


        |In Buddhism, rebirth is entirely unrelated to any notion of a deity. It's just that in the same way that your body does
        |'t vanish when you die, neither does your mind. The awareness that constitutes "you" just wakes up to a new birth. Hope
        |ully it's a nice one... If your mind is peaceful and concentrated when you pass away, you have a pretty good chance of 
        |eing reborn as a transcendental, ethereal, happy *deva* in a realm of bliss, capable of flight, not needing food, and s
        |ining like an angel, except invisible to humans and animals.


            |This sounds nice.


                |But the thing about Buddhism, is that it doesn't think that it's nice.  It holds that even existing in a realm 
                |f bliss for thousands of years will just give way to suffering.


                    |and, if I remember correctly, that non-existence is the only way to end suffering.


                        |No, the third tenet of Buddhism is that learning not to desire via the eight-fold path will end sufferi
                        |g. You can exist in nirvana and not suffer.////EDIT: second, third, and fourth tenets really

        | inquisitive. These are qualities that probably got them to where they are in their units. A lot of these guys in their
        |civilian lives were doctors, scientists, accountants - whatever. The point is, they're more often than not, very intell
        |gent individuals. ////Where I'm going with this, is if you can use your intelligence to question everything rationally,
        |and not arrive at a conclusion because you 'feel' it is right, but rather because you acknowledge there is more evidenc
        | to support your theory, your mind will be calmer because you're removing an element of uncertainty. ////What's that go
        | to do with SpecOps? They have to think of every possible scenario, every option and remain free thinking individuals w
        |o can work as a team - which requires intelligence. If they were to use blind faith, they wouldn't be SpecOps. Take sol

            |ome try to make humor out of the training. I've seen A1C Joe plumber make it through, and I've seen 1LT mathematics
            |major fail the course. What makes these men tick is the drive to never quit no matter what. The training is what pu
            |s the fearlessness in their hearts. After getting fucked up physically day in, day out, and doing what we did in tr
            |ining. Everything else just seems so silly, and when you have the experience of drowning, running so hard you feel 
            |ike you'll drop dead to compare your current situation to it just makes working under stress nothing. So basically

            |Faith and intelligence are not mutually exclusive. Any combat unit has to have faith. Faith is integral to a cohesi

            |you will. If anything, special forces/special operations have MORE faith than average grunts like myself. Those mot

            | It is part of what makes a good military truly great.


                |There's a difference between faith and blind faith. You aren't "blindly trusting the man to your left and right
                |, you know them, you know their abilities. When there's a dirtbag in the unit that single person can do huge am
                |unts of damage by simply being there and ruining that trust. You reason that you can't trust the dude based in 
                |he evidence you have and so you don't have faith that that guy is going to be there when you need him. Totally 
                |ifferent than blind faith. 


                    |Quite wrong. You can never be sure how anyone is going to react to a combat situation. It is 100% blind. As
                    |someone who isn't in the military, don't try and act like you know better than someone who is.


                    |Exactly.  Faith is crucial but needs an element of reason.  Just like blind reason would make you a coward

                | existing anymore.  You had no consciousness before, so you obviously couldn't perceive your nonexistence.  Now
                |that we are alive we can definitely comprehend not existing. 


                |Depends on the religion. Some put more emphasis on pre-life stuff.


                |It's not ground-shaking at all for Hindus, or anyone who believes in reincarnation.


                |You won't squeeze a real answer out of anyone, but keep asking


            |Yep, I've never been able to understand the fear of nonexistence. By the very definition of it you won't feel anyth
            |ng. You simply cease to be. What could be more peaceful than that? To me it's the thought of "living forever" in he
            |ven and watching people on earth be fucks to each other that seems like the worst choice. ////And as for the argume
            |t that in heaven all our wants and needs will be filled, constant happiness, etc... Well, that just seems a lot lik
            | lack of free will and thought. 


                |It's not fear of not existing, I believe sadness is a better description. I don't remember not existing before 
                | was born and that's fine, but now I know what it's like to live, to experience so many great things and to exi
                |t as a part of the universe. So it's really sad for me to think that at one point this will all be forgotten an
                | I will cease to be. To think I will no longer be able to eat, or breathe, or experience a smell, or talk to so
                |eone, or see a new thing, or hear music saddens me. But the worse part is that I won't even realize that I can'
                | do those things anymore, I will not have the capabilities of noticing I will miss those experiences that I so 
                |trongly enjoyed. It's not fear, it's a profound sadness. 


                    |Yes, but you won't even be aware of any of those things. There simply be nothing. So you're lamenting an en
                    | to experiences in a way similar to if you were being locked in a blank space for eternity. When in actuali
                    |y it would be simply the end of consciousness. There would be nothing to lament because there would simply 
                    |e nothing. And I don't see how living to be ancient and decrepit could be better. Give me ~70 good years of
                    |life and then peace. Sounds like a good deal to me. 


                        |I'm not saying it's not a good deal but it's still sad that it has to end. It would be nicer if it didn
                        |t end. That's the point of saying it's not fear but some sort of sadness or anxiety. 


                            |Living forever might get old after a while though. 


                |An afterlife of happiness is clearly one where they lie to you about what's happening back on Earth. 


            |Yeah but that makes everything you do in life seem so..pointless.


                |exactly. life is a desire, not a meaning. so do whatever make you happy.


                |Yup! To me that's freeing, not scary or depressing. Just try to leave the world a better place than you found i
                |.


                |The only point to life is eating and mating - everything else is a diversion.


                |It's not pointless. Think of all the people everyone meets in their entire lifespans. We have an impact on each
                |other's lives, and the world around us, all the time. Leave a *good* lasting impression.


                    |And then those people die. The end.


                        |Exactly. Leaving an impression is good but eventually the Earth will die and so will everyone with it. 
                        |o when that happens what did I matter?


                            |You matter if you decide you matter. Only you define what matters means. 


                                |Until you no longer exist to decide what matters.


                                    |But then it won't matter. Because you don't exist :)


                |Not everything has a point. The mountains don't have a point. The ocean doesn't really have a point. Yeah, anim
                |ls live on the mountains, people can climb and name them and conquer them, and oceans are a source of food and 
                |abitat for many animals as well...////But in the grand scheme, they just happened to be somewhat useful.


            |But, but I can't 


            |Ah, the classic Mark Twain quote.


            |"And is one dead only after living, or before life as well?"


            |Lets look at it this way, a person has never been allowed to sleep for more than 3 hours a day, and they dont know 
            |nything else, so its not all that bad, but suddenly, one day, they're allowed to sleep as late as they want, and th
            |ir body takes advantage of this wonderful situation. However, at the end of the week, they have to go back to sleep
            |ng 3 hours a day again, forever.  //  //Even though the non-existence before birth doesn't seem all that bad, becau
            |e you've never known anything else, at that point, the non-existence after death, seems horrifying, because we've k
            |own how great it is to live.


            |Did the world even exist before I was born?


            |That just made me a lot less worried.


            |There is nothing bad at all about not existing but there also is nothing good about it. To know that one day we wil
            | never again be able to experience the simplest and smallest parts of everyday life is a hard fact to accept. To kn
            |w that we will one day come to an end and disappear entirely is one of the hardest things for me to wrap my head ar
            |und and just accept. To me death is probably the scariest thing I can think of.


            |Except its horrifically frightening to contemplate non-existance 


        |You sound like you are afraid that when you die, you'll be locked in a dark room forever - that you'll have to undergo 
        |hat. But you need to realise that it's impossible to have an experience of nothing.////Try to imagine what it would be 
        |ike to go to sleep and never wake up. Think about it. If you do this for long enough, something will occur to you - wha
        | was it like to wake up after having never gone to sleep? That was when you were born.////So the only possible experien
        |e you can have after dying, is being born, in the same way that the only experience you can have after falling asleep i
        | waking up. And you cannot experience anything, including time, while dead. There will be no void to cross, no time to 
        |ass. You'll close your eyes, and die. And then, you'll be born.////As an atheist, this concept provides me with hope by
        |appealing to logic rather than faith.


            |I'm an atheist, and I understand where he/she's coming from. I'm not sure you get it. It's not that we're scared of
            |the experience of death - it's that we're scared of the end of life. ////I like being alive and doing things. It's 
            |cary when I realize there is a time limit to being alive and doing things, and I don't even know what that limit is
            | What if I get hit by a car tomorrow and die, without accomplishing all the short-term goals I've set for myself? W
            |at if I never accomplish my long-term goals? What if, when I'm 90 years old and my body's deteriorating, I'm not re
            |dy for the end?////Death is scary, and I don't think anything will make it less scary to me. I've decided to face t
            |e reality that it will happen and it will be permanent, instead of pretending it won't *really* happen. But I still
            |don't think I'll ever be okay with it or ready for it.


                |i hear you, and can empathize, however ever since i was young i reconciled this feeling with this:////some peop

                    |Wow, I've never looked at it from that perspective. I've kinda been selfishly thinking about all the things
                    |I might not accomplish, rather than the time I've spent and the experiences I've had already. Hopefully thi

                |The only thing I can say to help you is to find ways to perceive time differently. Stop thinking your life is a

                |watch?v=G4j6cUwCRmI ////*////Also another point I'd like to raise is that time is not divisible, like everythin
                | in life it cannot be quantified, the act of quantifying is an illusion. Example would be that if we assume the
                |universe is infinite, could you take a piece of it and call it 1 cm? No, a piece of an infinity is infinite as 
                |ell. Or if you call a mountain a mountain, is it a mountain or is it a rock? Is a mountain made up of a rock, o
                | is a mountain just a big rock? When does it stop being a mountain and just a big rock? ////*////Also this is m
                | translation from the one-ness with the universe as such in Buddhism, is no different than Quantum Mechanics in
                |science. Since every single particle in the universe corresponds to every other particle in the universe (gravi
                |y, photons) then it means that every particle in the universe is actually connected. So you are an expression o
                | the universe and the universe is an expression of you, if you remember that the universe is infinite and you b
                |ing a part of infinity are no different. Enlightenment in my opinion is when you have no doubt in your mind abo
                |t anything and you transcend the need to operate on decisions, because your mind firing electrons all around yo
                |r head has already made the correct decision for you, you just have to trust it. ////http://www.youtube.com/wat

                |I think dying will be peaceful. I mean assume you have another twenty years or so. Like you'll slowly start to 
                |et more and more and as you get older a nights worth of sleep doesn't fix that tiredness. The fact that someday
                |I will truly have no worries, no false hopes, I will hopefully have the time to look back on my life with no re

                |I am not afraid of death. I don't know if there's a god, or an afterlife, but I tend to lean towards faith in t

                |'t know everything that's wrong with me. I have back and leg pain, I limp, I walk with a cane. I don't know if

                |s are impossible. I'm not seeking pity; there will always be someone who has suffered more than I. Look at Chri

                |to suffer from it. It's that my belief in God (which comes and goes) stems from my need to believe this happene
                | for a reason. Not because God is punishing me or that I deserve this. (I know I'm fallible and imperfect but I
                |m not 100% asshole.) It's God laying the dominoes down for something in my future. Five years from now I will b
                | a different person on a different path than if I'd not had this accident. This blind faith (however weak) is t
                |e biggest thing getting me through this. ////Like someone else in this thread, they're glad religion helps peop
                |e through hard times. I'm one of those people. But I'm not afraid of death. I might even embrace it, despite wh
                |tever may or may not meet me there. 


                |Wow.////You are a coward. ////I am completely astounded because I am really not familiar with this level of cow
                |rdice. It's one thing to be a coward, but to actually accept that you're a coward and to say you'll always be a
                |coward is just shocking. ////Awful. Pathetic. Ridiculous.////You fucking bitch. 


            |It's actually not this it's that I'll never exist never have conscious thought or subconscious thought again I woul
            | simply cease to exist after death. Following an atheistic view point there is no second birth. I'm not sure I'm fo
            |lowing you at that point. 


                |I completely agree.  I'm fully aware that I will have absolutely no cognizance of what happens to me after I di
                |, that it will not affect me in any real way and that no part of me will even exist to comprehend it.  But this
                |rational thinking honestly does nothing to abate the pure terror I feel when I consider oblivion.  What I need 
                |hen I think of this is not reason, but emotional companionship; I need to hug my SO, pet my dog, or write my fe
                |lings down.  Unfortunately when you're in the military, your SO and pets are usually far away from you, and you
                |may not have the leisure time to write or talk to anyone about your feelings, let alone having anyone you trust
                |enough to talk to.  So if you find you can talk to God about it and that makes you feel better, I think that is
                |just awesome.


                |That's sort of what he's saying, it's a paraphrased Alan Watts lecture. Basically, the idea is that when you di
                |, your mind cannot simply no longer exist, because that's not an experience. Your mind can't just stop because 
                |he universe doesn't allow that. It's a sort of reincarnation, as the only experience of not living you have is 
                |he time before you were born. So a similar thing has to happen when you die as to when you were born. ////Look 
                |p Alan Watts, he talks about life and death a lot, and is pretty inspirational. 


                |What if rebirth had nothing to do with any religious concepts and was just the natural cycle of energy that can
                |ot be destroyed?


                    |But in my mind that isn't me that's my energy following through another which wouldn't be rebirth I would j
                    |st simply be keeping someone else alive is the cow you just ate reborn inside you. No it's just fueling you
                    |with nutrients and energy that once kept it alive. 


                        |One thing my fiance has said to me is that in an infinite amount of time, anything that can happen will
                        | and it will happen more than once.  So we have found each other once, and we will again, in exactly th
                        | same way.  Maybe we have before :)  It's not anything to do with religion.


                        |There is a school of thought that most people will not continue self-awareness after death. That is, mo
                        |t people's spirit or soul will dissipate as energy. That for those who wish to retain consciousness aft
                        |rward, there is a path to do so. But like so many things in life, one must prepare. It's not just going
                        |to happen automatically.////I discovered this concept by reading about Taoism and by reading the works 
                        |f Carlos Castaneda. Taoism talks about long-term practitioners becoming "immortal" and Castaneda talks 
                        |bout learning from Don Juan, a "sorcerer" preparing himself to retain self-awareness on the other side.
                        |///So, for me, most people will probably experience something like deep sleep without dreams. But peopl
                        | can prepare their spirit or soul to continue on. The true test of this would be being able to send you
                        | spirit to another location outside your body while you are alive. This, of course, is insanely difficu
                        |t and would take many years of learning and practice. But once successful, a person would no longer nee
                        | to fear the loss of their physical body.


                    |There is no such thing as mind energy. The mind needs energy to function but so does a car, and you don't s

                |I look at it this way.  If the universe exists on an infinite time scale. Given enough time, anything can happe
                | again, including your rebirth. Picture the big bang happens an unimaginable amount of times over and over, til
                | the universe's atoms all end up in the same perfect allignment that it takes for you to be born.  So since you
                |do not exist nor perceive time while dead, when you die you will immediately perceive being reborn.


                    |This is the plot of Infinity Blade

                |il I just decided to stop trying to explain myself. :-]


                    |Thank you I'm glad you understand. That's what I try do to do just not think about it fill my day with beau
                    |y and love and companionship but this is hard in the middle of the night when your left to your own thought
                    | and your fears creep from every corner of the room. 


                        |If it makes you feel any better, I'll remember you. If you tell me your first name I'll remember you an
                        | the conversation we have for as long as I live. At least you won't feel so alone then, knowing someone
                        |is thinking about you. 


                    |Just to be clear, this isn't the only logical way to view existence. So maybe other people just don't belie
                    |e it happens the same way?

            |I'm not not really seeing where you are coming from here. Please do not take this post as anything but me trying to
            |understand your perspective. I would just say that your comment seems to make a lot of conjecture. While it is true
            |that it is not possible to sense and perceive nothingness (we need stimulation from the environment to integrate se
            |sation into perception) this does not lead to your further conclusion that after death there is only birth. So I ju
            |t wasn't sure about a couple of these seemingly contradictory ideas. Especially the claim that you appeal to logic 
            |ver faith. Unfortunately, from my perspective, your comment lacked any logical evidence for your claims.////Again p
            |ease don't take this as aggressive or derogatory, I am genuinely interested in your response.


                |No offence taken :P logic isn't actually that much better than faith, when it comes right down to it, because y
                |u can logically prove anything, even if it isn't true. ////But the idea is that because death is a non experien
                |e, the only possible thing that you can experience is being born. Given an infinity of multitudes, all possibil
                |ties will eventually happen - and the infinity won't trouble you, because you can't experience time. 


            |What gives me comfort is actually the idea of entropy which is that the universe will always attempt to cycle throu
            |h every possible configuration until it achieves thermodynamic equilibrium. Which basically means that on a long en
            |ugh timeline, should fate decree, the atoms that currently make my brain will incorporate themselves into another l
            |ving creature.////It will then be through that creature, that I will live on. 


            |Alan Watts???


                |Yep,  what a great thinker that guy was :)


                    |Absolutely, many times listening or reading, its like I don't learn anything new per-say, but he says ideas

                        |Is it a quote from the book?


                            |"Some infinites are bigger than others."////Hazel Graces says this at some point, but I don't reall
                            | remember when. Probably something about dying so early and yet having a great time with Gus or som

                                |That's an idea that could be found in a lot of places (including every introduction to set theo

                |This comment shows a severe lack of understanding of...well, just about everything. 


        |I work in an emergency room, and I've seen people die (and held there hand a few times because family wasn't there). Th
        |s is kind of hard to explain, but when someone dies it's almost like the light that was them and everything that they w
        |re is suddenly gone and you're just staring at a shell.  You see this at the moment of death, or just before.  The firs
        | person I ever saw die, I swear, left their body before her heart stopped beating.  That light was just gone, but on th
        | monitor her heart was dancing in a crazy rhythm.  I think this, more than anything, makes me believe in the existence 
        |f a soul. Whether or not it's immortal I don't know.  But to deny it's existence just seems wrong to me.


            |I've been there. 


            |&gt; on the monitor her heart was dancing in a crazy rhythm////Pulseless electrical activity.


        |I don't follow any particular religion, and I've been an atheist for a good majority of my life. I'm fascinated by scie
        |ce and technology, and in fact have various hobbies tied to this. This may sound silly, but the reason I hope there's s
        |mething more after death is, I absolutely want to be with my dog again. She changed my life, and after 10 years, I lost
        |her unexpectedly. It'll be a year this December 1st. She made me realize why religion can be such an important part of 
        |eople's lives. It provides a closure in favor of people's best interests. I still want science to provide truth, but de
        |p down, I want to believe. 


            |Cue's X-files theme. Exactly this. 


        |I've been on the edge about it as well unfortunately. But while the thought of dying and then nothing scares me, the pr
        |mary reason is that I often drift into depression and my faith is the only thing between me and suicide at times.  It f
        |els like I'm hanging onto a thread, it is that simple, converting to atheism could quite literally kill me.


            |Hey man. I deal with a large amount of people who feel as though they are on the verge. And many who attempt but fa
            |l. They all regret it when recovering. PM me any time you want to talk.


            |Don't life is the most precious thing in the universe. I personally couldn't ever even imagine suicide due to my fe
            |rs but I've also lost a lot of friends to it. Even recently. Please don't harm yourself your important to me. I lov
            | you.

                    |:D 


            |Atheism would also have the potential to free you. If has certainly improved peoples lives in the same way religion
            |has improves peoples lives. 


        |I feel for you.  I don't believe in a God either, but one of my very close friends recently was diagnosed with brain ca
        |cer and I'm struggling to face that he will die before age 30.  I don't think afterlife is Heaven, but I don't know tha
        | it is "nothing" either.  I find myself hoping and wishing that there is something good after this life because I'm jus
        | not sure how I can face the way death takes good and bad people at random.


        |what branch and mos?


        |Thank you for this, it's comforting to know I'm not the only one who lives this way.


            |Your welcome , however I'm terribly sorry you live in the same thought process. 


        |Well on the plus side its not like when you die you just float around in a void.  You wont be able to be afraid so why 
        |ear it now?  


        |&gt; So I'm converting for hope and ease of mind.////I'm not questioning your faith, but it seems like you might be usi
        |g it as a crutch.


            |Maybe so but if a crutch is given and I am crippled I would be more foolish not to use it. 


        |as C.S.Lewis said "Christianity, if false, is of no importance, and if true, of infinite importance. The only thing it 
        |annot be is moderately important."


            |You could say the exact same thing about any religion.


        |I feel the same way, just as a normal college kid. It's been keeping me up and hour, hour and a half later than I want 
        |o be up some nights as I just sit in bed worrying about the abject terror of just... not being.////Shit's scary. I may 
        |ave problems with organized religion, but the comfort in knowing there's something beyond is not one of them.////~~But 
        |hat if we choose the wrong religion?~~


            |Don't choose just let be? That's what I'm doing I don't fear pain or suffering I know it well and anyone can overco
            |e it if willing so if you choose wrong and end up in hell deal with it torture only lasts as long as you let it. 


        |This. Logically, I understand that there likely isn't a higher power and personally I strongly disagree with religion a
        | a whole. But the idea of never seeing the people I have loved and lost again upsets me to the point I have generated a
        |belief system.


        |You've just explained why religion exists at all;  people are weak-minded.


        |This. I came up with the term "sperist" to classify myself :) I don't think there is a god, but I sure as hell hope so.
        |///


    |This will probably get buried but I have a really strange conversion story. Some backstory: ////All throughout high school,
    |I was an atheist. I had a lot of issues with my dad in ninth grade. He was a brain cancer survivor but it caused him to be 
    |azy and didn't take care of himself ever. He just stayed inside all day and played wii sports and I hated him for it. It ca
    |sed my parents divorce because they were always fighting and I visited him a few days a week and I stayed the night on frid
    |y nights. I wasn't happy going to visit him ever, I loved him but was always bored when I was there, and he only ever took 
    |s to fast food for dinner.  We got into fights a lot and I often refused to go visit him and a couple times I told him I wa
    | done with him, he was an asshole, he didn't take care of himself and I couldn't respect him.  Looking back I want to stran
    |e my little shit self.  Well at some point in January of 10th grade we got into a fight and I told him that I wasn't going 
    |o see him because I wanted to hang out with my friends instead. He said ok and that he loves me as I hung up on him.  I don
    |t remember what day but some day next week was my birthday. Everything was going all right, but I got a call from my grandm
    |ther saying that my dad had a seizure in the night and passed away. I was devastated. Absolutely fucking destroyed. I hated
    |myself. Not only was my dad dead, but the last thing I said to him was that I don't want to see him.  At the funural I talk
    |d to one of his friends and he told me that he talked to my dad the day that I told him off and that my dad was still gushi
    |g about me. He was so proud of his son who was pretty smart and a really good kid and stuff like that. This made me feel bo
    |h good and awful at the same time. I stopped going to school for about a week or so. I started drinking and smoking weed an
    | becoming a rebel and just an obnoxious little kid.  None of this stuff helped my anti-religiousness.////Fast forward to se
    |ior year: ////By this point I was done smoking weed, I cut my hair, I didn't drink nearly as much and I applied for college
    |to be a software engineer and was just doing pretty well in general. I had a nice girlfriend who I dated off and on through
    |ut high school, but she was religious and sometimes that caused, not arguments, but rough debates you might say? I don't kn
    |w what to call them. But she asked me to go to this show with her and I did because we both had similar tastes in music. Mu
    |h to my dismay, however, it turned out to be a christian rock concert and I was pissed. I sat there on my phone the entire 
    |ime and I was just mad at her for dragging me to this stupid show. The band was actually decent but that's beside the point
    | Towards the end I started thinking about my life and my dad and all my feelings towards him.  On the ride home me and my g
    |rlfriend of the time were talking about our parental issues, she has a super controlling and bitchy mother, and I talked ab
    |ut my dad. By this point I realized that I never actually got over him, I just bottled all my anger and sadness and hate re
    |lly deep down. It was now flowing out. I explained to my girlfriend in the driveway that I hated my dad because he destroye
    | my family. Drove my mom away and ruined his own life. I was mad at him because I never got a chance to truly make up with 
    |im and become good like most guys do with their dads. I never would because he was dead.////In front of my house we have th
    |se little lights that were battery powered and came on at night. However they haven't worked the entire time we lived in th
    | house (5 years).  While I was talking about this stuff, the fucking light came on. This broke me. I was already crying but
    |I was bawling at this point. The fucking lights didn't work. I was pissed. How the hell were they working? It made no sense
    |  The light went out when I pointed it out to my girlfriend. She thought I was nuts. She didn't see it. It came on again wh
    |n she was talking to me and went out again when she looked. I begged her to believe me and she asked me "you know what that
    |light means right?" and I told her I did. This time when she looked the light stayed on. I was freaked out and I went and c
    |ecked out the light. I tore it apart trying to see what was making it working. Nothing. At this point I went inside and my 
    |om said that she got this intense feeling in her gut that she needed to talk to me, that I needed her support. ////Well I'm
    |sure you can imagine what happened from there. But the next day I went out and got that light from outside and examined it.
    |There was a battery. The battery was dead. I tried a new battery. The light still didn't work. The light does not work. Fro
    | this day I keep that light on my shelf and think about it whenever I miss my dad. There may be some sort of scientific rea
    |on that the light worked, but to me, my dad came down from heaven that day and told me that everything was okay, he forgave
    |me before it even happened.


        |Wow.


            |Yeah, wow.


        |For what it's worth, I believe you. And I accept your explanation. Thank you for sharing.


        |What a touching story, thank you for sharing.


        |I really want to give you gold but im broke. I really hope this is true cuz I think you might have just converted me.


            |I don't care about gold really. But thanks a lot. I mean every word I said. I am not creative enough to create a st
            |ry like that. It was one of the greatest feeling moments I've ever had. I don't align myself with christianity nece
            |sarily, I just believe in God and that there is an afterlife. I haven't gone psycho religious, and I don't push bel
            |efs on others. I just feel really good thanks to the experience, believing that there truly is something out there.
            |////I never believed in those stories of people having revelations. I always thought they were just crackheads or i
            |sane people. And I'm not saying they aren't, but I consider myself pretty level headed and I'd be lying to myself i
            | I continued not believing after experiencing that


                |Well good for you man, youre inspiring. I hope i have one of those moments someday.


    |Grace.////That's the short answer. The long answer is that I was raised Catholic, had 12 years of Catholic school, but for 
    |lmost all of that I didn't really believe in anything. For most of my upbringing I saw it all as social pageantry. when I w
    |s around 10, through discussions with different friends, I realized that everyone actually believed all this mumbo jumbo. b
    | the time I got to high school in a private Jesuit school, I would have considered myself an ardent atheist, at times borde
    |ing on /r/atheism level. I had a great relationship with most of the priests there (Jesuits are the best!), but still didn'
    | really have any faith or urge to have any. ////Then, when I was 17 or 18 it just sort of happened. I now view it as a comb
    |nation of factors including coming out of a very depressive episode, a school retreat, and an attempt at a literary reading
    |of the bible (I recommend this for anyone who never has. Being versed in the most read book in western civilization is kind
    | important, and afterwards  you realize how many authors use biblical references as literary tools simply because the refer
    |nces are so well known). It was a very weird feeling to accept grace and put my faith in God, especially at an age when man
    | friends were just starting to question their faith.////8 years later, I still question my faith, because it's ineffable. T
    |ere's nothing logical about it, it just is.


        |Kairos?


            |Live the 4th buddy


            |Kairos was probably the best retreat I've been to. The way ours worked even non-Christians could take part


                |Led a kairos with 4 of my good friends a while ago, gotta say its even better when you're the small group leade
                | and you get to watch all the participants open up to you.


            |That's what I thought haha


            |I have friends who went to Jesuit schools and went on Kairos. I'm always jealous whenever they'll talk about their 
            |xperiences at it!


            |I'm going on that next month. I am so excited from what I've heard. It's supposed to be powerful. 


                |It's pretty cool


            |Hell yes, I did this. Still an atheist but it's an amazing experience. LTF!


            |I'm guessing yeah. I turned atheist after Kairos (and now am an ardent but nonspecific theist) but holy damn was th
            |t some powerful stuff. I am so very not Catholic anymore, but I do love me some Jesuits. It makes me very happy the
            |pope is a Jesuit, and I think the Jesuit approach to, well, everything is why he's making so many waves. ////I thin
            | of them as the brain of the Catholic Church. Franciscans are the heart, Benedictines are perhaps the muscle. But J
            |suits are all brain. 


            |Shit it is scary sometimes the common things people have on reddit. Now I'm wondering what school it was out of....


        |I had a similar experience, although add about 4 years to everything on your timeline and switch Jesuit high school for
        |Jesuit university. Those Jesuits, man. They're fantastic, and I'd be joining them if I didn't want to get married som
        |day. 


        |Same here. Belief found me.


            |&gt;  Belief found me.////No offense, but that's nonsensical. 


                |Kind of the crux of OPs post right?  //  //&gt; There's nothing logical about it, it just is.  //  //I'm lucky 
                | came to this discussion late. I really like the maturity of these top comments. 


        |I had exactly the same journey but in the other direction. Believed, got depressed, read bible, lost faith and learned 
        |o love life for life's sake.////One of the biggest things for me was realising how hollow so many people's existence mu
        |t be if they need external meaning to make life "worth" it. Life is worth it all in of itself. After all, we live for t
        |e happy moments. They're the ones we look back at with greatest fondness. When we truly feel "alive".////I've not seen 
        |eople speak of religious experiences with the same affection as holding a newborn, or sending your child off to their f
        |rst day of school, or a great evening out with friends.////And when people are fighting to survive, their willingness t
        | hang on to life is for more of those happy moments. Not to worship more. I figure that's the "meaning" (silly word for
        |the context) of life, really.


            |If we are made in the image of God, a relationship with God is not external, it is built into the very fabric of wh
            | we are.  


                |And yet you need an outside source, namely a parent or person who already follows one random religion of which 
                |here have been at least 3,500 historically (many of which did not have a "one god", but rather a pantheon), to 
                |ave that "connection" to teach it to you.////No, it's external. Babies aren't born citing scripture, and societ
                |es completely cut off from Christianity have no concept of it. You have your religion because you were either t

                    |learned over time but within the religious context our meaning is not something external put onto us but an
                    |innate hunger within us that must be filled.  A relationship with God is not something extra but a fulfillm

        |Reading through the whole bible is part of what made me become an atheist.  As part of my discovering what I believe pr
        |cess I found [this](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/), which really sealed the deal for me.


        |Beautiful answer, but what is "grace"?////Did you feel that you were in a state of misery or unhappiness or uncertainty
        |or sin or something else negative, and suddenly you realized that there was this standing offer of a warm, comforting e
        |brace that you had just been refusing--and, in so seeing, recognized the Offerer of the embrace?////I mean, I'm a total
        |atheist, and I find this baffling. What is grace, and why would we need it? (This is like, I don't think I'm inherently
        |bad or particularly trangressing, so why would I need forgiveness?)


        |What you went through feels like something I once experienced. I was brought up in a Hindu household, but my parents we
        |e never very strict about religion, and I never showed much interest in it. I suppose I would describe myself more as a
        |nostic than atheist.////When I was about 16 or so, I was lying in bed one night, and all of a sudden had this sort of e
        |iphany that there is a god, and that this god has a plan, and that everything will be okay. There was a god, and whethe
        | you believed in Vishnu or Jesus, it was all the same god. Yes, there had been disasters in the world, but in the end, 
        |od was protecting us all, and the world was becoming a better place. I have to say, that sudden faith was an absolutely
        |fantastic feeling. It was so comforting and I basked for a while in this new idea. Eventually, I fell asleep feeling li
        |e I was being hugged by the universe.////And then I woke up the next morning, and this feeling had already begun to fad
        |. I don't know whether the logical part of my brain started working, or the part that allowed blind faith stopped being
        |overexcited but by midday my sudden belief in god was gone - more slowly than it came, but gone nonetheless. I was left
        |with some measure of regret for the loss of comfort, and some relief at feeling like myself again. ////This never happe
        |ed to me again, but it was pretty eye-opening, in that it showed me firsthand just how comforting faith can be, and why
        |people might choose to stick with it despite the logical contradictions. It's not for me, at least at this time of my l
        |fe, but now I understand.

        |I find it interesting that you and I had pretty much the exact opposite experience as you despite being in a nearly ide
        |tical upbringing. I was raised Catholic and went to Catholic school K-12. For almost that whole time I was a devout bel
        |ever. I had great relationships with the priests. People often assumed that I would be a priest myself. At age 17 or 18
        | I realized I didn't have any idea why I believed the things I did. Eight years later, I identify as an agnostic atheis
        | with no qualms about it (aside from the fact that it makes my mom quite sad).


        |&gt;because it's ineffable. There's nothing logical about it, it just is.////That's why it's called faith. If it was lo
        |ically proven, it wouldn't be faith.


        |A literary read through the bible is very interesting for lots of reasons, I find. Which translations did you happen to
        |use? ////And along that note, I'd recommend a literary read through the Koran sometime. It's worth reading as well, sin
        |e a third of the world follows it! ////Between those two, you've got a surface level background on over half the world'
        | religious beliefs. 


        |I question my faith often. The more I seem to do it the larger my faith and idea of who God is and what he can and coul
        | be becomes.////The fear of questioning IMHOP has lead to the craziness of the Evangelical right and fundamentalism is 
        |hristianity. Most Evangelical Christianity doesnt have a leg to stand on beyond the Scripture. The church has a rich hi
        |tory of theologians and tradtions that expound on the character of God to which many Evangelical and fundamentalists ha
        |e never even read or simply dismiss out of fear. 


        |Your experience really isn't any different from that of any religious person I've ever met. You were never an atheist. 
        |ou "converted" from atheism when you were a minor, while still attending religious school.  You were just being a kid, 
        |uestioning everything the way all kids do at puberty, and then you ended up being Catholic anyway.


        |Does grace necessarily have anything to do with religion though?


        |"Being versed in the most read book in western civilization is kinda important..."//You found God in the IKEA catalogue

        |Kind of like agnosticism?

        |So reading the Bible helped your faith grow? It had the opposite effect on me, as it reinforced my belief that most rel
        |gious folk cherry-pick from the do's and don'ts of their faith.


        |&gt;There's nothing logical about it, it just is.////What's the difference between that and accepting that there isn't 
        | "God" of any sort whatsoever?////We are made of electrons and atoms, neurons, quantum strings, whatever! - *there's no

            |You can get to know God. If you're ignoring him, you can't.  This is from the Christian's perspective though. I wou
            |dn't know how to figure out the difference other than specifically christian theologies. Most of Christianity says 
            |ou have to accept Jesus before you die - and an atheist can be aware of that doctrine (yet not accept it). 


                |&gt; You can get to know God. &lt;////How? These kind of statements are incomprehensible to me.


                    |Exactly my response. Furthermore, you can "get to know" anything! I can get to know you, I can get to know

                    |it's something I can get to know) is "God exists", which only brings us back to square one: we disagree on

    |"Surprised by Joy" is a book by C.S. Lewis about how he was raised Christian, and hated it and became atheist for most of h
    |s young adult life. He kept trying to get out of it, but eventually he reasoned himself into agnosticism. From there he rea
    |ly didn't want to become Christian, but the same thing happened, where he realized it was worse for him to keep believing t
    |e things he believed and not be Christian than to just become a Christian.


        |My conversion was very similar to his in so far as I realized if I was honest I couldn't buy into all the arguments I h
        |d constructed against theism. The lifting of this barrier was both inspirational and terrifying, and I was eventually l
        |d back to orthodox christianity through study. 


            |Could you explain further about the arguments you had constructed against theism? I was raise Lutheran continues to
            |believe into my early twenties but I then couldn't any longer buy into the arguments for theism. Seems like we had 
            |pposite journies and I would like to understand your perspective better. 


            |Similar experience here.  I think the reason some atheists argue about religion so much is to convince themselves t
            |ere is no god . . . at least that's what I did. 


                |There's probably some truth to that.  For me, I realize that my brain (and human brains in general) will tend t
                | evaluate things emotionally and instinctively rather than logically, if I let it.  Our minds desperately want 
                |o find order and understanding, even when we're just looking at random chaos. We are easily confused and easily
                |convinced of incorrect ideas.  ////I'm 100% atheist now, but I suspect that if I start going to church, avoid a
                |heist information sources, and read /r/christianity every day, I could probably have myself sincerely believing
                |again within a couple years.////In some sense I feel like I have to "choose" what I want to believe, then work 
                |t believing it, because if I just let my brain run off on it's own, I'll end up believing the first religion wi

                    |What both sides are loath to admit, is that we just don't know.  Every argument has a rebuttal and every re

                        |I disagree with you. Knowing between right and wrong is not a "faith based" value. We as a species are 
                        |redisposed to doing things that are considered "morally right" due to our tendency to be altruistic to 
                        |thers of our species. When modern humans were first starting out, they had to rely on others to do the 
                        |ld "I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine" mentality, particularly when hunting game that is diffi
                        |ult to corner and kill individually (such as a lion, a tiger, an elephant, hippo, mammoth, sabertooth t
                        |ger, or other large animal). The same idea applies to finding and creating shelter, taking care of the 
                        |ids, and working as a team to accomplish tasks greater than that achievable by an individual. ////Thing
                        | that go against this predisposition of mentality is what we as humans might consider as "wrong." Murde

                        |societies). Incest may also be considered as something that is "wrong" but on a much lesser degree than

                        | two fold; 1. psychopaths exist, who literally can't feel empathy(or at least not strongly). That's why
                        |books of morals don't work on them. 2. we can turn off empathy is we can place people out of our tribes
                        | usually as a threat to our tribe(this is why we like to form tribes, and will often demonise people to
                        |justify our own actions.) I-tribe behaviour is usually very emptathic and 'moral', though.

            |Before I start I'd like to mention a few things about your comment. Let me apologize for this long response. I hope
            |it gives you some perspective, and I hope that anyone who reads it will be encouraged to join in the discussion.///
            |Just a bit of background on myself. I grew up in a household where both of my parents were Catholics. However, shor
            |ly after I was 5 or 6, my parents began bringing me to a Methodist church. I became ingrained within the community 
            |nd it was a great, comforting feeling to be there. It was great to think that a just and loving God was watching ov
            |r me (and helping to provide the cakes and cookies afterwards). I became the most devout when I was 13-15 years of 
            |ge. During this time, I attended 7th-9th grade and had Bible classes every Tuesday night for 2 years up until my co
            |firmation. In the middle of my freshman year of high school, I was confirmed and was on my way.////After confirmati
            |n, my parents slowly went to church less and less. We would go every Sunday, then every other Sunday, then only my 
            |om would go with me every other Sunday, until finally we stopped going altogether.  Shortly before my parents stopp
            |d going, my Dad was promoted and my mother got a job as well. My coursework in school was becoming overbearing, and
            |the extra 8-10 hours a week of social activities (in addition to sleep overs/hanging out with friends/family functi
            |ns/etc.) was becoming too much for me to handle.////I tried to find something that was more natural to my skills an
            | interests. I wanted to go into something challenging yet enjoyable: something that would benefit me intellectually
            |and get me a great career in the process. So, I started taking more science and math courses. After taking courses 
            |uch as AP Biology, AP Physics, Calculus, Chemistry, and Astronomy my faith began to wane more and more. I asked mor
            | and more questions, such as the origin of my body, my species, my consciousness, and the universe. At this point, 
            |y interest in science became so powerful, I stopped thinking about God altogether. God became irrelevant to my life
            | My family never went to church anymore, we never spoke to anyone in the congregation anymore, and I could find mor
            | and more things to explain in the natural world with the public education I was receiving.////Fast forward through
            |5 years of university and I graduated with a B.S. in Geology. Needless to say, the science overcame the faith in my
            |life, and it remains to this day.////But, I digress.////---////Your comment does not deserve the down votes it's ge
            |ting. Simply questioning someone's beliefs should not be seen as an unsavory action. As scientist Lawrence Krauss h
            |s said numerous times, "There is nobody whose beliefs aren't subject to question." I agree with this statement in t
            |e sense that I think every person needs to have good reasons to believe in something. As for me, I don't believe in
            |anything. ////People of faith have to have the strength to question their beliefs and understand why they believe t
            |e dogma they subscribe to. A person of faith who does this may find themselves fence-sitting between their own reli
            |ion and atheism. Scientists are natural skeptics, and people of faith should be as well. One of the most common rea
            |ons that I see for why people believe in God is that it provides them comfort. Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary bio
            |ogist, has said, "just because something gives you comfort doesn't mean it's true."////Though I cannot speak for th
            |se who hold a particular faith, I can at least share some of my own observations. First, faith is the act of believ
            |ng in something without empirical evidence. People of faith can become defensive when their beliefs are challenged.
            |If you are a scientist, you're forced to have a small ego because you get proved wrong all the time. Your views cha
            |ge constantly. So how does this contrast with a particular belief system?////**I submit that belief in God could be
            |due to these people holding *a.)* an egocentric view of the universe, *b.)* denial of empirical evidence, and *c.)*
            |a need to believe in a higher (divine?) being.**////Let me explain. As I mentioned, people take comfort in thinking
            |that there's a higher being taking care of them (egocentrism). Some people go so far into denying empirical scienti
            |ic evidence (denial --such as the true age of the Earth, the origin of species, and the origin of the universe) to 
            |upport their ancient worldview (as the doctrines themselves are ancient). Some people just believe in a God because
            |they've believed it since they were a kid (and never grew out of it) or they feel like they need it. Some people ma
            | believe in a God because they feel it enforces within themselves a sense of morality (and without it, they would d
            | bad things). Some may believe in God to escape things that may or may not even exist past the life that we have (p
            |rgatory, hell, heaven, etc.). ////Notice that all of the things I mentioned are beliefs which are held without usin
            | logic or reasoning. They are emotional responses to the possible existence of God and are therefore not logical. /
            |//**Despite all of this I mentioned above, I think it is important for everyone to get some exposure to religion. I
            |'s part of tradition, and it is something that society used to depend on.** Back in the olden days, the church was 
            |he only authority. They were the only ones that could fund science, and fund exploration (aside from governments th
            |mselves). Now, **science supersedes religion** in every way essential to the future benefits of civilization. Scien
            |e gives us technology and an understanding of the universe that doesn't require the existence of a divine being. Re
            |igion is becoming quickly out-dated, as our understanding of the forces of nature and origin of the universe snuff 
            |ut religious doctrine of creation. ////Now, to answer your question:////There are have been thousands of religions 
            |n antiquity. Each person of each belief system believed that the doctrine they bought into was right. These people 
            |ould wage wars and have strife upon one another based on the teachings of their religion. Those of Islam are ordere
            | to kill anyone accused of apostasy. Those of Christianity are urged to kill their brothers and sisters (to strike 
            |he first blow) if simply *accused* of heresy. Hinduism encourages the caste system (with "The Untouchables" being t
            |e scum of society). ////&gt;How can you claim that a loving god gave you the correct interpretation, when there is 
            |pparently so much wiggle room in it?////Let's not target only Christianity: all religions do the same thing.////A p
            |rson who has been indoctrinated into a particular belief system **knows** that their religion is the right one. As 
            | scientist, I can't be sure of anything. So, if the process of generating scientific, empirical evidence through th
            | scientific method can't explain anything to 100% certainty, why is it that so many people can simply *believe* in 
            |omething without having a shred of evidence backing their beliefs? I agree with you in this regard.////&gt;How does
            |one reconcile all of the internal contradictions?////Denial. That, or the particular person(s) of faith in question
            |have never actually *read* The Bible and don't *really* know what is and isn't mentioned within its covers. ////&gt
            |And if one is just picking an interpretation, then what makes your choice better than another's? ////Confidence. Wh
            |n I was part of my church, I was told that what I was hearing was the word of the Lord, and that His word was THE w
            |rd. I had no reason *not* to believe because I had never actually thought about *why* I believed what I believed in
            | I just did. Having been someone who has experienced this in the past, I think I can speak for others who have gone
            |through the same thing as I when I say this--*lots of people who are indoctrinated into a particular religion don't
            |even think to question their own beliefs because its been so ingrained into their everyday lives.*////&gt;I guess t
            |at is one of the biggest issues that I have. The whole thing is based on a book that is clearly not designed by an 
            |ll powerful, all loving, all knowing being. So what gives?////You're right. The Bible was written by people after t
            |e fact. The New Testament was written years after Jesus' alleged death. The funny thing is, nobody really knows if 
            |esus existed. Jesus was a very common name. It's actually the Jewish name for "Joshua." The only mention of Jesus i
            | in the Bible. The only reason why the Bible has existed this long is because of two things. First, The Bible was s
            |read by word of mouth. The stories likely morphed, and through tradition and time, those stories have changed to wh
            |t they are in the Bible today. Many interpretations exist, and each one more distorted than the last. The original 
            |ible and beliefs held by those who worship the God of Christianity have done so simply through the passage of time.
            |Stories that may have once been considered simply ludicrous have been taken literally in meaning, through antiquity
            |and into today. ////**TL;DR: The best and worst thing you can do for your beliefs in your religion is to question t
            |em. Be inquisitve and ask questions. Don't believe what you're told. Don't believe what I'm saying just because I s

    |the same god. ////Pretty much since discovering religion at the age of 10 I've believed in a god of some sort just because,
    |like I said above, it is just more logical to me that there is one than that there is not. (I don't mean logical as in proo
    | - I mean more, the idea that everything that exists comes from a sentient, omniscient being is more rational to me than th
    | idea that it all randomly and meaninglessly came to be.) As a teenager I actually really rejected Christianity because I s
    |w all the terrible things people did and said in the name of God, but then I realised that there are bad people and good pe
    |ple and some are religious and some are not, and it is dumb to reject a religion which makes you happy because other people
    |are doing it wrong. In addition, a lot of religious people who espouse bigoted views are actually reading the Bible in cert
    |in ways which are not universally accepted by other Christians, so it's usually a lot more constructive engaging in a conve
    |sation about that as someone else who values the Bible.////So basically now I classify as a Protestant and sometimes go to 
    |hurch. I believe in science and I don't think religion alone is a good argument for anything unless you also back it up wit
    | scientific or sociological reasons. That said, generally in my experience religion has been a wonderful thing which made m
    |ny communities of people I know very happy.

                        |All respect to OP, but discovering religion at the age of ten is *not* converting from atheism to relig

            |The Boston is strong in this one.


            |This comment is actually quite condescending. Would you say that to an atheist? If you told an atheist "I'm glad yo
            |'re comfortable with your beliefs" everyone would freak out because it implies that you are talking down to them an
            | that they are living in a less "real" world than your own.


                |I wasn't trying to be, I was expressing gratitude that he's happy in his choice. Believe it or not, people can 
                |e friendly on the Internet.


                    |I understand the intention, and I have had many positive encounters over the internet. I just think you may
                    |want to consider rephrasing your sentiment because it can easily and justifiably *be perceived* as condesce
                    |ding. If you opened up about how you feel about reality and then someone curtly responded with "I'm glad yo
                    |'ve found a way of life you're comfortable with," you may feel somewhat subjugated, as if they know what th
                    | world is really like and are happy that you're safe in your bubble. I'm not saying that was your intent, b
                    |t that's how it comes across.


                        |Perhaps, and I see your point. I legitimately was trying to come across as friendly (reddit can be a li
                        |tle hostile to people who follow a religion sometimes).


                            |No, I definitely believe you. It's just hard sometimes to find when people are being nice because t

        |Very nicely put.  


        |Thanks for your answer. I don't mean to be disrespectful but I cringe every time I hear that if evolution or the big ba
        |g is true then we all just randomly came into existence which isn't true at all.//&gt;randomly and meaninglessly came t
        | be.////[This](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/essays/why-evolution-isnt-chance/) article brings up some g
        |od points to take into consideration.


            |i think he means, why order, not chaos? why structured rules and laws instead of randomness, why something, not not
            |ing.////personally, my belief really came down to that, then grew from there...


                |Ooh! This stuff is super fun.////1. We have only very, very small amounts of order. Most of the universe is in 
                |isorder. In many cases we perceive order where there is none.//2. When you have lots of stuff going on, predict
                |ble behaviours tend to emerge. Hence why the macroscopic world is predictable - the laws and rules we are used 
                |o kind of "pop out" of the unpredictable mess going on at the microscopic level. Also, the anthropic principle.
                |/3. There are many ways for there to be 'something' but only one way for there to be nothing. 'Nothing' is an u
                |stable state.////I recommend Lawrence Krauss, who is currently making this kind of loopy cosmology stuff unders
                |andable by regular folks like us.


                    |1. is plain wrong, what you perceive as disorder, is really just order we don't understand yet.   everythin
                    | functions off of unchanging physical laws, and if something seems not to, it just means you don't know the
                    |relative law.////2.  this seems to be claiming that the rules are caused by the existance, rather than vice
                    |versa...   this is simply philosophical, not proven fact.////3.  disagree, there are also many ways to have
                    |nothing.   without rules that govern our something, it is effectively nothing, as it cannot be acted upon. 
                    | again we are talking philosophy not science.


                    |&gt; We have only very, very small amounts of order. Most of the universe is in disorder. In many cases we 
                    |erceive order where there is none.////How are you defining or measuring that order? Do you mean something l
                    |ke low entropy? Even if it is a high-entropy state, isn't it still ruled by laws, or math, or equations, an
                    | thus ordered, everywhere, in the ancient Greek sense?


                    |nothing is not an unstable state, its not a state at all, it doesn't exist because its nothing. 


                |Because if there was chaos we wouldn't be around to experience it. Since we exist, there must be order for us t
                | exist within.


                    |Anthropic principle is the more scientific term for this. If there were no rules or order we wouldn't exist
                    |and therefore only universes with order can be observed by the life forms that evolve there. 


                        |That statement itself is a rule that came from somewhere


                    |But saying we have order in is isn't refuting his beliefs, it coincides. The question "why / how order from
                    |chaos" is not answered by "because we observe order".  


                        |The question "why is there order rather than chaos in our universe" is meaningless because there can be
                        |no truly chaotic universe with observers in it.////Saying that we have order because there's some being
                        |that did it is only a way to sweep the question under the rug, a way to not confront it because you rea
                        |ize that the question and it's possible answers are actually meaningless. All answers to the question *
                        |hy* eventually come down to the old "it's turtles all the way down" meme, and the only way to avoid the
                        |question is to show how meaningless it is.////But although we cannot know *why* there is order rather t
                        |an chaos, what we can try to find is *how* order came to be in this universe rather than the chaos you 
                        |ould statistically expect.


                            |But why wouldn't you try to give meaning to something meaningless if you could? That's the point of
                            |religion isn't it? Their beliefs can only be rational if the question is ultimately meaningless as 
                            |ou say it. You just swept the question under the rug yourself by arbitrarly discarding religion, wh
                            |ch makes this whole chain of comments truly meaningless considering the thread.


                                |&gt;You just swept the question under the rug yourself by arbitrarly discarding religion////I h
                                |ven't swept the question under the rug. I admitted the fact that it can't be answered because i
                                |'s meaningless. And then I moved on to more fruitful pursuits.////What religious people do is a
                                |gue with other religious people about the "why", and when they ultimately get tired of it they 
                                |gree to split off and start their own religion with their new answer as their basic doctrine. W
                                |at they have in common though, is that they'll never agree to the fact that the question is mea
                                |ingless and can't be properly answered in the first place.////&gt;But why wouldn't you try to g
                                |ve meaning to something meaningless if you could?////That's exactly the point. I would if I cou
                                |d. But you can't. No one can. The question is meaningless. Some people don't realize that or do
                                |'t want to admit it. They search for meaning where none can be found. Once they're tired of sea
                                |ching or they get stuck in a loop, they just pick whatever feels right to them and uphold it as
                                |"the truth".


                                    |In that case meaning is subjective though. I can agree with your opinion of structured reli
                                    |ion, but I don't think it's relevant to this discussion. Ultimately the question boils down
                                    |to ''I can give it meaning'' ''no you can't''. If you consider meaning to be subjective, li
                                    |e I do, it's easy to take a side on the argument. 


                                        |Let me ask then, what's the point? You're only lying to yourself.////Actually, lying to
                                        |yourself is fine. My problem is when people lie to other people.


                                            |You can see it like that, but that's the kind kind of lie that disappears once you

                                            | happy. Makes sense that a lot of people do, and it's probably the ''optimal decisi

                        |Because there isn't another way. It's a dichotomy that one of the options is not possible.  Asking why

                |I think the issue is that people consider it illogical for non-deity origination to be "random and meaningless"

                |ings, and nothing is 100% efficient, so some energy is always lost; energetic bodies tend to be unstable becaus
                | of vibrations and temperatures, so high energy constructs tend to fall apart while low energy constructs tend

                    |yeah, but what you've just described (which i believe 100% BTW) is based on very particular underlying laws

            |ts to admit you don't know, and to come to terms with the belief that you will never, ever know, but it's how i've

                |Actually, i think what katela described is agnostic deism. 


                    |Agnostic Theism is right. [Deism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism) is believing that the Earth and the w

                    |hension so that belief fits more into [Agnostic Theism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theism) (which is simp

                    |Let me be quite clear, bro. I am not religious. Not one bit. What part of inherently unknowable did you not

                    |that means that religion is no good, since how in the fuck would we be able to know what it is a higher pow
                    |r wants from us? To me the idea of religion is pure hubris, because to be able to know what 'god' wants is 
                    |o understand and comprehend that god, which I don't actually think is possible.////As for my 'belief' in th

                |I've only just heard of this argument (just googled). Very interesting! ////I believe that to a certain extent 
                | in the way that science can't explain everything (in my head). An example of this is always going to be the or
                |gin of the universe. Science can't really explain it (again, **in my head**. Don't want to cause a huge debate 
                |ere.) so I believe there are *other* things at work like perhaps an omnipotent.... *thing* (its hard for me to 
                |ut into words what I believe God is). But then, I actually believe that science is almost evidence in itself th
                |t God exists. I don't think there is a conflict between science and God, I think science gives an explanation o
                | a 'chunk' of what God is/can do.////I'm sorry if none of this makes sense to anyone, its hard for me to put my
                |beliefs into words 'cos I've never actually explored it in depth. I try to stay away from debates. No-one knows
                |my beliefs actually. All in all, I'm very open to other theories that anyone has to offer and I would never bas
                | down someone's ideas or question them. Its just no-one can change this feeling I have that there is *something
                | out there.


                    |Would it be easier to say that God is nature itself?


                        |That's quite a good way of putting it actually. Maybe nature but something bigger, something spiritual

                            |e to time) but I personally never really gave that oneness I have felt a label like god. I get that
                            |sort of feeling looking at the stars at night and feeling close to the universe and everyone.


                                |Yeah exactly I know what you mean, its just that feeling of ...something. Something unfathomabl

                                    |(I don't want to turn you off to this discussion but) I think that religion has hijacked th

                                        |I completely agree with you on that! I really believe this 'feeling' is subjective and

                                        |esoteric elements, which are very fluid, mystical, and actually correspond quite closel

            |I'm so happy to know there are people out there like me.  The past couple of months I went from being an atheist to
            |being an agnostic theist simply because I feel better believing there is a God that I can pray to and count on even
            |if it turns out it's imaginary.  It's selfish, but I've been so much happier.  So basically I went from atheist to

        |But wait a minute.  Did you ever actually self-identify as atheist?////Also I'm curious about the "logical" thing.  Cou
        |d you give more detail?


            |If you read the top answers, they're personal and much more related to meaning and coping with emotions that they a
            |e about logic. This is not to belittle their experiences, as we all cope with things some way or another, but I thi
            |k saying it's logical is misleading.


                |I agree. I think it's quite presumptuous and frankly ignorant to call an alternative "more logical" simply on t
                |e basis of personal incredulity. Oh my, how could all of this possibly come about through a "random" and "meani
                |gless" process! Therefore, God. That logic is tight, yo.


                    |I use to have this line of thought as well, but then I stumbled upon Richard Dawkins "Ultimate Boeing 747"

                    |The meaningless argument just doesn't make a lick of sense to me. It is obvious that meaning is human. Ther
                    |'s nothing inherently meaningful about the Sun, a tree, or the wind, *unless someone is there to find it me
                    |ningful*. Meaning is something we create. Therefore, even if the Universe, us and all of existence were a r
                    |ndom happenstance, just the fact that we're here means something, because we give meaning to us and everyth
                    |ng. It is like giving things names. If we weren't here, nothing would have a name. But since we're here and
                    |give everything a name, then everything has a name. To say that without god and with randomness and chaos a
                    |d accidents, then nothing would have a name or a meaning is fallacious.


                    |And I think it's presumptuous and ignorant that you think logic is without subjectivity.


                        |Um, ok. I never said logic was without subjectivity. I just found it amusing how the author argued God 
                        |as a "more logical" alternative with nothing but his own personal incredulity to support his statement.
                        |It really is a logical fallacy. ////


                |Have you read the last days of Socrates?  (Plato) - he makes a beautiful logical argument for the existence of

            |What he means is that he likes the idea more. People just use rational and logical because those seem to be the des
            |riptors you're supposed to use in these kinds of discussions regardless of whether they apply.


                |When something is logical to you, it usually means it makes more sense to you. There might not be concrete scie
                |tific proof but based on the evidence provided to me, I believe this.


            |I have a feeling he meant it like I would. It seems more rational to think there is a God that designed all this in
            |ricate, interwoven, and improbable stuff than it just being an accident. That is the fundamental objection I have t
            | Atheism. I just can't get behind the idea that everything just kind of happened. The odds are just too minute. You
            |could argue with me, but at that fundamental point, we're both simply applying faith, because no one can know.

                        |Bro-science in fitness. The only reason it exists is because it makes sense based on the extremely limi
                        |ed understanding of exercise and physiology that most have. Take for example someone who says that doin
                        | squats is bad for your knees. Very large forces have to travel through your knees in order to squat 40
                        | lbs.  Cartilage can be damaged by excessive loads.  Also obese people have bad knees due to carrying a
                        |ound excessive weight.  And people can and do injure their knees doing squats.  Based on the evidence p
                        |esented, someone could conclude with some logic that squats are bad for your knees.////However, when yo
                        | have a more nuanced view (in this case a more thorough understanding of physiology), you would realize
                        |that squats when done with proper form build muscle which help stabilize the knees, bad knees in obesit
                        | are caused by *constantly* carrying around excessive weight, and that most injuries are either caused 
                        |y poor form or by lifting weights past your limits.////So the second view, when combined with the appro
                        |riate knowledge is more logical than the first, although the first isn't completely devoid of logic.

            |What is your religion? Does it have to do with the Christian idea of "god"?

            |You spelled "atheist" wrong.


            |What is the reason there should be a reason?


            |For me, I wouldn't want anyone to use Guidelines, Rules  or Commandments to have a relationship to God.    Unfortun
            |tely for religion, the only way most people, clergy included can accept another religious person is if they follow 
            |hose established guidelines or rules.   Often times, you don't even know the rules, only if you break them, while o
            |her times they spout out the rules, such as anti-gay, anti-abortion, etc.   God didn't make those rules, man did.  
            |ome say they are found in the Bible or Koran, but there is no proof or logic to validate they are truly  from God a
            |ymore than we can prove or justify God by logic or reasoning.   But I am not religious because I follow the rules, 
            | am religious because it makes sense to me that there is a God.   I questioned my beliefs many times, and still que
            |tion them on occasion, but ultimately I come back to accepting there is a God.   And I don't care if someone says I
            |have to follow this rule, or that guideline, and in many ways refuse to follow rules for religion because I know it
            |s man attempt to measure me against their scale, but that isn't God's way.   I just accept God and do as he told an
            | tells me.  //And please, don't think I'm telling you there is a rule about believing God, since I just said there 
            |sn't any rules and I won't judge, condemn or criticize you, and I accept you just the way you are.


            |Happy Cake Day! Thank God.


            |I suppose it depends on your definition of a higher power, but I'm curious to know why this is more logical to you?
            |I understand many of the reasons people are religious, but do not understand how people could base their ideas in l
            |gic. Care to explain?


                |If you see, for example, Aristotle's necessity for an Unmoved Mover in his Physics, it basically boils down to 
                |he same idea. The argument, essentially, is that it makes no logical sense for there to be an infinite regressi
                |n of causes (D was caused by C, C was caused by B, B was caused by A...etc.). So there must have been one prime
                |cause which he calls the Unmoved Mover. Many philosophers considered the Unmoved Mover to be God, but there are
                |other ways of looking at it which still make sense. 


                |My idea of a higher power changes every day - it's not something I claim to have the answer to.   I find the id
                |a of a man in the sky who made humans in his image strange and illogical,  but the idea that the whole universe
                |is somehow greater than me,  and I'm intrinsically linked to it and exist within and because of it and can infl
                |ence it and cause it to change shape... I think of God like that to the universe.   Something much greater than
                |it that gives it life ( not in the sentinent sense) and grows and "learns"because of it... Yeah.   I have never
                |seen any convincing evidence that coincidences are accidental, either. 


            |This is one thing I've never understood- how is it more logical that there was a sentient, existing being to create
            |everything? Where did this sentient being come from? You can keep adding creators ad infinitum; and if this sentien
            | being doesn't need to be created, then why does the universe? Besides, the odds of random chaos existing and givin
            | rise to order vs. a sentient being randomly existing? The whole idea is extremely illogical.  And the idea of a hi
            |her power needing to exist to give our lives meaning is more insulting and patronizing than logical, but that's a p
            |rsonal matter, not one of logic.


                |This is where I draw the line in speaking to the religious. Why do they think they deserve purpose? When did be
                |ng an ape become sacred? Are we not but a mote of dust, floating in the night sky? A tiny speck of light in an 
                |nfinite sea of darkness. If suddenly our entire planet were accidentally snuffed out by the infinite number of 
                |ays a planet can be destroyed by the universe, nothing whatsoever would change; the universe is indifferent to 
                |s, we are in no way "special" or "sacred", which in turn means that our lives are a trillion times more importa
                |t than the religious cults of death would have us believe, because once our life is over, there is **nothing**.

                | essentially be every living thing on the planet... and some inanimate things too :), rather than doing it for 
                |od, with that fear/hope -of- reward/punishment at the end of it all somewhere in a corner of your mind.////Don'
                | get me wrong, even without religion, I strongly believe that good things have to *cost* something, I have just
                |rejected a lot of the ideas of catholocism, like personal sin, original sin, and eternal sacrifice.////Having s
                |id all this, I suppose as long as a person is sacrificing to better themselves/those around them, any reason (d
                |vine or otherwise) is a good enough reason.


            |&gt; the idea that everything that exists comes from a sentient, omniscient being is more rational to me than the i
            |ea that it all randomly and meaninglessly came to be.////The only problem with this is that if a god made us and th
            | universe, who made god? Another god, which was created by another god which was created by another god? The only o
            |her option would be that god came to existence out of nothing, but that was an unsatisfactory explanation for the b
            |ginning of of the universe, so now we're back at square one.//


                |Interesting!


        |This is one thing I've never understood- how is it more logical that there was a sentient, existing being to create eve
        |ything?  Where did this sentient being come from?  You can keep adding creators ad infinitum; and if this sentient bein
        | doesn't need to be created, then why does the universe?  Besides, the odds of random chaos existing and giving rise to
        |order vs. a sentient being randomly existing?  The whole idea is *extremely* illogical.  And that's not even going into
        |the problems of "omniscience".


            |You have the same unanswerable questions on the other side of the equation.   What's at the end of the universe, wh
            |t caused matter to exist in the first place.  Where did everything come from?//


                |True, but the point is that the idea of "god" solves none of these questions and introduces more. In what way i
                | it useful?


            |&gt;how is it more logical that there was a sentient, existing being to create everything? ////One explanation that
            |I have heard is that the both the impossibility of an actually infinite series of events and the arguments against 
            |n eternal universe require the existance of an uncaused cause—some being which is *neccesarily* existant to be the 
            |ause of all contingent events and beings. ////&gt;random chaos existing and giving rise to order////As far as I kno
            |, the theist who argues as above is not considering how order came to be imposed on pre-existent material. They are
            |considering how all that is came from nothing. And by nothing, they mean "no thing"—universal negation. Not chaos, 
            |ot a fluctuating quantum vacuum, not *any*thing. They reject the idea that nothing—which, as a non-thing, has no ph
            |sical properties or causal power—could produce something.


                |&gt;the arguments against an eternal universe require the existance of an uncaused cause////That's weird becaus
                | Aristotle thought that it's precisely because the universe is eternal that there must be an unmoved mover (bas
                |cally an uncaused cause).////edit: something from Dawkins on the subject of theologians responding to his argum
                |nt of the Abrahamic God as necessarily being himself a complex cause that needs to be explained : "The theologi
                |ns, he writes, demanded that there must be a first cause, which can be given the name God. Dawkins responds tha
                | it must have been a simple cause, and he contends that God is not an appropriate name for it, unless God is di
                |ested of its normal associations." The normal associations of course being omnipotence and omniscience.////The 
                |nmoved mover of Aristotle by the way was a pure cause and had nothing to do with a god, regardless of what the 
                |ater Christian and Muslim theologians would argue.////&gt;they reject the idea that nothing—which, as a non-thi
                |g, has no physical properties or causal power—could produce something.////But that's exactly what scientists as
                | when they say "but where did God come from?" Why is there a God (or gods) rather than no gods? Just because yo
                | can't have nothing? But if God was not created - if he is already there and has always been - why can't the sa
                |e apply to the universe itself? That's where Spinoza arrived at basically and the only thing he could do was to
                |conclude God was the same as the universe.


                    |&gt;Aristotle thought that it's precisely because the universe is eternal that there must be an unmoved mov

                    |niverse bugan to exist, but he argued that if it *had* begun to exist, then an unmoved mover was neccesary.
                    |I might be way off though . . .////&gt;Dawkins responds that it must have been a simple cause////This is in
                    |eresting. Could you elaborate?////&gt;why can't the same apply to the universe itself?////Are you asking wh
                    | arguments against the eternity of the universe don't work as arguments against the eternity of God?


            |The idea of "God" isn't just some super powerful alien that created the universe. God transcends the need for a cre
            |tor. God goes *beyond* what we can comprehend, like the concept of infinity. I don't think you fully understand the
            |idea of how God is theorized to fit into things.


            |The very fact that you can think about all this at all is illogical.If the universe was not created then what is it
            | and if it was created how is there not an infinite loop of creators of creators? Who knows


            |I think the idea is that since the ad infinitum argument refutes both "god" and "no god," then one explanation is a
            |god who is not bound by time. This being experiences reality in a completely separate way.


            |&gt; and if this sentient being doesn't need to be created, then why does the universe?////Your argument is actuall
            | illogical. You're saying that things logically must be created. But then to explain why the universe doesn't need 
            |o be, you use his exact argument. You criticise his argument then use it when it suits.////I'm an atheist, btw.


                |His argument is perfectly logical, it is you who misunderstand. His argument is that one of the main justificat
                |ons raised for believing in a god is the finite existence of the universe, often implying that "god" already ex
                |sted prior. However, this doesn't solve the question: "how did that being come to be?" It's just circular reaso
                |ing.


                |I'm not sure I follow you. GP states the universe was created but the god was not, that's more logical than the
                |universe wasn't created. OP states that GP's conjecture does not avoid an uncreated existence, it merely puts t
                |e uncreated aspect on the god. This results in double jeopardy: either an uncreated universe is illogical and t
                |erefore so is an uncreated god OR an uncreated god is not illogical and therefore neither is an uncreated unive
                |se.////This is a relatively common argument, I'm not sure I see the issue here.


    |My teacher told me this one-////He didn't care much for religion back then. One night he went out to a party in high school
    | got really drunk and didn't want to ask his parents for a ride home. So he decided to walk a mile and a half to get home. 
    |bout halfway through, he didn't think he would have the energy to get home when he sees a church door open. He peeked his h
    |ad in to see if anyone was there, and upon finding nobody there, he decided to crash there for the night. It was better tha
    | sleeping in the car parked out front (since he realized during the night he was locked out). He woke up the next morning a
    |d went home. Upon arriving at home, he sees police tape. His older brother had been involved in gang activity, and apparent
    |y he pissed off another gang enough to shoot up his house. And in front of the house was the car- torn to shreds from the d
    |ive by last night.////He believed that someone was looking out for him that night. God had opened the door to the church fo
    | him because it was not his time to go yet.

            |I know that you are being sarcastic, but I heard a story about conversion to Islam from one of the lecturers severa

            | Prophet Muhammad, sal Allahu 'alaihi wa sallam, until he died as a martyr at the battle of Uhud.////Somebody sarca
            |tically mentioned that many people converted to get into the pants of the religious girlfriend (in case of Islam, t
            |e girlfriend even does not have to be very religious, since traditionally requirement of having only Muslim husband
            |is a pretty low hanging fruit among ethnic Muslims - they could drink alcohol, never attend mosque in their life, b

                        |Catholic, the concept of true, free will is absolutely core to understanding the faith. I guess I belie

                        |But divine intervention doesn't need to conflict with free will in every case, so do you believe in som

                            |As for me, yes. They don't need to conflict with each other. Example: praying to God for help with

                            |teractions, I believe when you ask for it, God might give suggestions, as I've had moments where I'

                    |Most Christians believe in free will and think that 'bad' things happen in our world as a result of people

                    | of human events in order to help people. This may sound contradictory (and it probably is in the case of f
                    |ee parking spaces opening up) but it seems real to believers because they see evidence for it all the time.
                    |This evidence can be explained from a purely physical perspective as a sort of game that believers play. //
                    |/Say, a single parent who is involved in the church is having trouble taking care of their kids and paying 
                    |ent. Other church-goers who want to 'align' their actions with God's will may take notice of the single par
                    |nt's plight. In this case they will feel empathy with the single parent and be compelled by 'God', whose ch
                    |racter they know well from immersion in church activities, to give of their time or money to help. The sing
                    |e parent will have been asking God for help, and will view the church-goers actions as help sent from God, 
                    |hich it was. The idea and character of God taught by the church has motivated the action that has fulfilled
                    |someone's need. In this way, we all have free will but God can intervene through the actions of others that
                    |align with His character and goals.

            |Something that might help you to understand why religious people are okay with people dying in stories like this is
            |that they believe in an afterlife. To them, it's not that God didn't care so He just let the kid die, it's that God
            |let the kid "come home" to heaven. The kid's in a better place than it was here on Earth. The kid never has to worr
            | about anything bad happening to him ever again.////Likewise, when religious folks tell a story that involves "God 
            |rotected me because it wasn't my time to go", they mean that they believe that God had something else He wanted the
            | to do/accomplish in life before they get to "come home". Death isn't an end for religious people, it's a beginning

            |I forget what scripture but one says something along the lines of time and unforeseen circumstance befall us all ( 
            |'m paraphrasing allot )... Essentially sith happens some times to good people sometimes to bad it's not all hand of
            |god or the devil things just happen


            |I think of it like this:////God could very step in and stop everything bad from ever happening and fix all the prob
            |ems of humanity but he doesn't because we all have free will. Sometimes people choose to use this free will to hurt
            |others.////In other cases God sees reason to step in and provide some help through other people. Someone left the c
            |urch door open but God did not make the man go inside the church, in his drunken state he chose to go inside.////Ha
            | he chose to go sleep in the car instead he could have died. That doesn't mean God wouldn't have cared about him it
            |just means that what he chose put him in a situation where someone else's choice hurt him. 


            |No, just the opposite...//When there is a coincidence which looks so planned-out towards a purpose, it makes people
            |realize that there may be a higher Purpose for everyone's life. I believe that God has a plan to shape and mold peo
            |le so that they can eventually become part of His Family. Maybe OP['s teacher] could gain perspective which will la
            |er help him in his life after this one, (like learning to teach) while his family will wake up and see that whole n
            |w world. God knows every single person He created, and He knows what is best for each one. When that kid dies, it w
            |sn't his last chance. He/she will have the chance to know exactly who God is, in a world where there is no more vio
            |ence. -"They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of
            |the Lord as the waters cover the sea".//TL;DR: God has a plan for every single one of us, and this life is just a t

            |The logic is obviously flawed. Sounds like a rather gullible person, that teacher


            |Yeah THAT'S never been brought up before. r/atheism would give you triple the karma you have now. Should have saved
            |it for that.


            |When coming close to death like that, it's more comforting to believe someone was looking out for you and "spared" 
            |ou than the idea that you're not really invincible and could be killed at any moment. Getting "lucky" still doesn't
            |feel so good if you think the alternative could have been just as likely.


            |This. ////I can't stand when someone tells me they know god exists because of some coincidence that happened, like 
            |hey forgot their wallet at home but they found a $50 bill on the ground so they didn't have to go all the way back 
            |ome.////Sure, God ignores the war in the middle east, starving children in Africa, and natural disasters that wipe 
            |ut entire towns full of religious people, but he made sure you had $50 so you could buy your damn oreo's and milk!


            |If something happened to little kids, it would be a tragedy but no one would blame God for it. A lot of religious p

            |can be seen as an alternate plan/divine intervention, if not a miracle, by God. Just my 2 cents. 


                |&gt;  The silver lining in their eyes is that children are still considered innocent and only carry the burden 
                |f the original sin and hence are automatically (made) angels.////I think that's actually a scarier belief. If t
                |is was the way reality worked, then the most moral thing a person could do is kill as many young children as po
                |sible before they're old enough to sin. Sure, you'd damn yourself for all those murders, but it'd be like makin
                | the ultimate sacrifice.////Sadly, some parents have actually killed their own children because of this belief.
                |I'm not stating some crazy hypothetical - this is not only something people believe and act on, but it's also c
                |mpletely consistent with mainstream religious beliefs.


                    |It is a pretty scary one, but like you said, unfortunately it happens. If anything, the parents are to blam
                    |. God wants people to live their lives and learn as they grow. If they do good or bad relies on them. Yeah 
                    |here's a million other factors, but ultimately it falls on the person. The parents that didn't give their c
                    |ildren the chance, sadly, are the reason that modern day religion is so skewed. Too many people are caught 
                    |p on how their children's behavior is going to reflect on the kind of person/parent they are. 


                |That's not how the myth even works. ////A) Unless you are cleansed of your original sin you are still considere
                | tainted and are not allowed access to heaven. That's what baptism is. Unbaptized children are sentenced to hel
                | in the form of purgatory, which is considered a torture because it is outside the realm of god's influence and
                |you feel eternal loss for not being within his sphere of influence.////B) According to the myths, angels are se
                |arate and independent creatures that god created before humans with no relation to humans and no free will. The
                |e is no piece of the bible that says you become an angel after you die. Most of the angels are described as inh
                |man monsters with animal faces or impossible to conceive of forms. 


                    |I should've specified baptized children, you're right, but never did I say I was quoting the bible. It is s
                    |rictly a belief that is passed down through story telling, especially in the Hispanic culture. People are a
                    |lowed to interpret the stories in the bible how they choose after all, and children becoming angels is more
                    |so for the comfort of grieving parents and family members than it is for mythological/biblical accuracy. 


                |Ok, but if something bad did happen to kids, shouldn't people blame god for not stopping it?


                    |I've had conversations with my father about this when i realized i no longer wanted to be christian. He sai
                    | to me "God gave us free will so we can do our own thing in this life, if he intervened for every bad thing
                    | are we experiencing that free will or are we not living life as god wants us to live it."


                        |Then god is unwilling to stop suffering.  He has the power to end it but allows suffering to happen.


                            |I quit religion for a reason, im not gonna sit here and defend it. If you want a genuine argument o
                            | w/e, im not the 2nd party.


                    |That would imply that God is 100% in power.////If he can't control an Atheist, why would he be able to stop
                    |that?


                        |Are you implying god isn't omnipotent?


                            |Yes. Yes I am.////According to the Bible, God never talked to man again after Jesus.////God also ha
                            | no control over man's mind.////So yeah, he couldn't do that.

                    |I guess a more morbid way of putting it is that everyone has a "divine" expiration date associated with the
                    |. Your life itself is what you make of it, the challenges and struggles along with the joys. Some people ju
                    |t have a shorter time than others. Some people are perfectly fine with this, others like you question it. T

                    | blame. A scapegoat for their own spiritual insecurities. And it shouldn't stop at spiritual insecurities, 
                    |t could also extend to other insecurities in their lives as well, but it just seems easier to blame someone
                    |that is always supposed to be a guiding light. ////Edit: words. 


                    |I find this hard to explain also but here's what i think: the reason which you think God is to be blamed fo
                    | such suffering is because there is a sense of injustice associated with it. after all, why must a innocent
                    |child suffer from a terminal disease when criminals and murderers are allowed to live? ////However, from a 
                    |eligious point of view, this world isn't seen as the end of things. instead, there is continuity in the aft
                    |rlife. this allows justice to be served after our lives on earth. So the suffering child will be in paradis
                    | and the murderer will be put to justice in God's time. not ours. it may take years sometimes. and if it do
                    |sn't occur on earth, it will occur in the afterlife. ////However, this notion requires faith and an ability
                    |to endure suffering in this life by clinging onto the belief that judgement will come one day. 


                        |I have heard this line of reasoning  before, but there is a big ethical problem with it to me.  ////The
                        |justice meted out in the afterlife is, in most interpretations of the main religions, based on our cond
                        |ct in this life. That means that the child might get to heaven precisely because his life was cut short
                        |and because he did not get the time to develop into a murderer. If the murderer had died as a child, he
                        |would have faced a completely different verdict in the afterlife. ////I.e. justice is served based on a
                        | arbitrarily long worldly life. An dead infant will not have had the time to conduct a sinful life and 
                        |s therefore given a free pass, while the 90 year old had to fight his way through a lifetime of hardshi
                        |s and temptations in order to get the same verdict? That is not true continuity. 


                            |wow that's really interesting and got me thinking a lot. here's where it gets fuzzy. it's hard to c
                            |mpare both lives in such a manner because they were lived very differently. the murderer got years 
                            |f free will which he could have used to do good but chose otherwise. if he had done good instead of
                            |wrong, he might have received a great reward from the big guy up there. On the other hand, the chil
                            | suffered despite his innocence and was immediately granted a place. ////Now I understand that this
                            |may look unfair in our eyes, because it may look as though one person is asked to run a 100m sprint
                            |and the other is asked to run a marathon and they both might get the same reward eventually. Howeve
                            |, we must acknowledge that their circumstances are different and therefore it's hard to form a reli
                            |ious comparison. A marathon runner in real life will give you a ton of reasons why he would rather 
                            |un a marathon than a 100m sprint even if the reward was the same. The idea is that God's plan is di
                            |ferent for everyone is tailored differently and that there is no comparison. judgement is served in
                            |ividually and not relatively. The reward itself cannot be compared as well. If both parties get pai
                            | infinitely, then there can't really be a numerical comparison between the two. If both parties get
                            |paid infinitely, then there can't really be a numerical comparison between the two. ////That was re
                            |lly hard to process. i hope you understand what I mean. just my two cents as well.


                    |God doesn't limit free will,  He'll open the church for but he won't make that teacher go in. ////There's p
                    |obably millions of examples of God's intervention but you can't really line the pieces up. Catching the bus
                    |when you thought you'd be late might have avoided a deadly car accident,  but if you never drive the car th
                    |t day anyways the accident would never have happened. God hopefully gave the gangsters a sign,  to not do w
                    |at they were going to do, but they ignored it, shot up each other anyways,  and innocent people died becaus
                    | of it. That's the world we know we live in,  and that won't change whether you believe in God or not. 


                        |Thanks for the answer.  But i guess what bothers me i what appears to be the selective help offered by 
                        |od.  Innocent victims of tragedies vs. Tebow assuming god wants his team to win.


                            |Yeah but I can say,  "God helped me write this post", and it doesn't make it true. God helps Tebow

                            |Disasters do happen,  That's the way the world works,  but God also works through the people who go

        |If he had called his parents to pick him up, the parents and the car may not have been there when the gang came by...

        |t coincidental? How does this make sense? He just sounds blinded by his grief to be honest.


            |No. Most serious Christians would believe God didn't have anything to do with either action. It's free will. He had
            |the free will to go into the church, so he did. The gang members had the free will to shoot the car, so they did. G
            |d doesn't step in anymore, like He used to with miracles. The purpose of miracles was to prove His existence withou
            | a written Bible.  We have the Bible to go on now, so there's no point in deciding people's choices for them.


                |That explanation itself seems rather weak, what a neat explanation for why there are no miracles

    |to kill is only a picture on the wall. This illogical Third Need of mankind, the drive for things superfluous beyond our ba
    |ic existence, is not a perfect parallel for explaining religious feelings to non-believers (just like it's difficult to des
    |ribe color to the blind), but it's the best I can do to illustrate that the human experience in the Universe is not bound b
    | the empirical and the rational by default. Besides, there is still so little we actually know about the way existence work
    |. The eternal drive for knowledge is one of the cornerstones of humanity, and it is beautiful, yet the flip side of the coi
    | is that at every scientific period, we tend to think that we have the basics all figured out. We believe that the current 
    |hysics and quantum mechanics laws of nature are unshakable. Not to discredit science and its pursuits, but every preceding 
    |eneration of thinkers also held their beliefs set in stone, until the next discovery upturned our understanding of the worl
    | on its head. Thus, is it really so inconceivable that our presumed mastery of the world is still greatly exaggerated, our 
    |ostulates are liable for error to be revealed via yet-unknown methods, and we are controlled by forces we have not yet begu
    | to fanthom? It's no reason to dethrone every scientific achievement, but IMO it's enough to curb blanket skepticism and to
    |allow the very real possibility that the scientific pursuit simply has not advanced far enough at this point of history to 
    |efinitively tell us what we must dismiss as fully impossible. From what I've come to understand, the world is divided into 
    |hree levels of existence: The Non-Living, the Living and the Divine. It is ridiculously difficult to jump from one level to
    |the other (we still don't have full understanding of how to jump from Level 1 to Level 2 by creating life from non-living c
    |mpounds). A stone does not have the capability of understanding how opera music functions. Likewise, we as humans know so v
    |ry little, if anything, about the Divine, the spiritual, the supernatural level of being, that all we can do is be guided b
    | those unexplainable, spiritual forces that have driven humanity since the very earliest days (the first permanent structur
    |s of stone were not even basic shelters - they were religious shrines), and try to make sense of them via the various relig
    |ons developed by our cultures, our innate spirituality, or what have you. Trey Parker of South Park put it well in one [int
    |rview](http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Entertainment/story?id=2479197&amp;page=1): "Basically ... out of all the ridiculous
    |religion stories which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous — the silliest one I've ever heard is, 'Yeah ... there's this bi
    | giant universe and it's expanding, it's all gonna collapse on itself and we're all just here just 'cause ... just 'cause'.
    |That, to me, is the most ridiculous explanation ever."////Though I believe in Jesus, I believe all faiths basically hold th
    | same merit, and in the eyes of God, what really matters is whether you are a good person. However, I still identify specif
    |cally as Russian Orthodox. I understand that I was born into that faith, but it still provides me with an unmatched degree 
    |f comfort, an ages-deep connection to my people and my roots. For someone that has moved around quite a lot in my life and 
    |one through many environmental and personal changes during this time, Russian Orthodoxy became a part of my identity, somet
    |ing reassuring and stable in a volatile, mercurial world.////Edit: I just remembered my earlier mention of my atheist grand
    |as, both of whom had quite an influence on the man I became when I grew up, and decided that I might as well elaborate on t
    |em, to whatever end. One of them, a Geology professor from the big city, at one point expressed his disgust with anti-Semit
    |sm when he said "Our Lord, Jesus Christ, was a Jew, so how can any Christian in their sane mind be an anti-Semite?" Regardl
    |ss of my understanding of anti-Semitism (it's messed up to hate on any religion/ethnicity period), that totally threw a wre
    |ch into my understanding of his religiosity, but the man is gone now, so I may only wonder. Maybe it was a decent reflectio
    | of Soviet Russia's constant identity crisis in terms of its relationship with Christianity. My other grandpa, a transplant
    |from rural Siberia to the Russian south, where he quickly became the Director ("mayor") of a collective farm that displayed
    |top marks/profits for 30 consecutive years, restored the town church (that has been de-domed and decommissioned into a grai
    | silo by the Bolsheviks), where his wife (grandma) regularly attended service and where I was baptized at a young age (thou
    |h I lived the following 8 years as an atheist). My Mom would always tell me how God will look kindly upon this act, and as 
    |n architect I've always wanted to work on a church design since then. By now, the closest I've got is design work on a syna
    |ogue, which still, somehow, feels very right. As I've said earlier, I believe we all worship the same God - we simply have 
    |ifferent ways of getting in tough with Him.


        |I mean I understand what you're getting at by "what matters is whether you're really a good person," but the Bible expl
        |citly states that our works can not save us. Galatians 2:17-21 is a good example, if you feel like doing some reading.


            |The Bible is indeed The Good Book, but I don't hold it as fully infallible. I believe Lord God to be perfect, but n
            | human, even saints, are perfect themselves. Jesus did not personally sit down and write The Book - it was written,
            |re-written and translated by humans after His passing, and there is no human volume of writing that I would hold 10
            |% unquestionable. Some might have an issue with my "buffet style Christianity" (as someone on called my approach on
            |e), but I would rather think for myself than blindly follow a rigid doctrine. As Galileo, a deeply religious man, o
            |ce said in his Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina:////&gt; I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God wh
            | has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.


                |If you, as a Christian, don't believe that the Bible is infallible, then the God you worship could be anything 
                |ou want him to be. Without a doctrine to hold to about who God is, then you can just fill in parts you don't un
                |erstand or don't agree with using your own opinions.////The god you believe in is not but a figment of your ima
                |ination with some Christian elements.


                    |So if I stray from your personal interpretation of the Bible, my concept of God becomes merely "a figment o
                    | my imagination"? What if I told you that different Christians subscribe to different sects, and people wit
                    |in them also interpret the Bible differently? Are all Protestants automatically disqualified because they o
                    |iginated from Luther, whose "deviancy from Catholic dogma was a figment of imagination with some Christian 
                    |lements"?////It's easy to dismiss any non-empirically based emotion or belief - religion, love for another 
                    |erson, passion for a hobby, etc, as an irrelevant, imaginary concept. Human experience so far has shown thi
                    | to be an underestimation of our mental and spiritual capabilities. Much of human achievement was driven by
                    |passion and inspiration that can be brushed aside under this "imaginary" approach.


        |Jesus was quite clear that non-Jews were equivalent to dogs. The New Testament in general is rather clear that being go
        |d isn't relevant, that even families will be separated in the afterlife and there will be tons of suffering for non-bel
        |evers.

        |Ah. The good ol' anti-/r/atheism circlejerk :)


            |Hey, what are you doing in here being critical? THAT IS NOT ALLOWED! This thread is clearly founded upon whole reve

        |All the posts that aren't seriously answering the question have been annoying, but this made me laugh. Have an upvote.


        |I'd known it long before I found r/atheism. It just made it possible to connect with people who think alike.

        |Yes, that is known as the community of reddit.


    |My father was an atheist for about 40 years of his life but ended up changing his mind after having several very vivid drea
    |s about his late father and sister.  In one, his father spoke to him and said that he was in heaven and that everything was
    |okay.  He also had one while we were on vacation in which his sister came to him in a garden, wearing white, and told him t
    |at God was real and heaven was real.  There were other dreams too but those are the most memorable in my opinion.////His mo
    |her-in-law had a dream around the same time in which my dad's father appeared to her and asked her to tell my dad that God 
    |as real.  She was so struck by this that she wrote him a letter about it, which he still has.  This all happened about 15 y
    |ars ago and within several months he went from being a lifelong atheist to exploring the conversion process at our church a
    |d ultimately becoming devoutly Catholic.


    |It turned out that it was kind of a phase in high school, and I realized that I never really stopped believing in God. 


        |Thank you for your honesty. I get the impression that a lot of the people who responded here were only "atheists" for l
        |ke a year or two tops, but only as some sort of lame teenage rebellion shtick that got old pretty fast. They can't real
        |y explain how an atheist turns religious, because they were religious their whole lives, but just spent part of their f
        |rmative years questioning themselves, which is something everybody does.


        |your username lies...


            |About what?


                |I tried... it wasn't cooch...


                    |It was "Cooch". My old username is /u/Passwordiscooch. Someone logged into it and changed the password. It'
                    | deleted now. 


                        |What did you expect?


                            |I expected pretty much what happened. It was just a gag.


                        |Oh, I see! I guess its good that you got a new acc then.


        |Grrr, people like you make my life harder!  My mom is convinced my atheism is a phase... even though I'm 26.


            |Not all phases are limited to youth. I'm an atheist, but my dad has always been religious until a few years ago. He
            |says he's an atheist now, but I'm convinced it's just a phase even though he's in his late 50s


                |Why are you convinced that?  It seems so dismissive to me to tell someone "Oh, you think that now, but I know w
                |at you REALLY believe."  Why is it "a phase" when someone changes their mind?


                    |He just doesn't seem sincere about it. He's mostly just mad at the Catholic Church. The "phase" idea is mor
                    | of a hunch, based on knowing my dad for a really long time. But who knows? Maybe in a few years I'll be pl
                    |asantly surprised.


            |Its true though, most people that "convert back" were never really atheists and were just going through a phase. I 
            |now it pisses us off since its used against us, but some people are just not atheist and are just "mad at god" and 
            |enting or were never given the choice.////Once you are an atheist, there's no way back, unless god himself begs you
            |to believe in him, and even then, you'll just believe in him, but there's no way you would join his club or even co
            |sider him a good entity.


                |Yeah, even if I knew God was real and exactly as presented in the Christian Bible, I could never worship him.  
                |hat doesn't mean I'm mad at God, though.  *Sigh*


                    |Why the fuck did I keep reading "Christian Bible" as "Christian Bale?"  This comment makes a lot more sense
                    |to me now.


        |That's funny, I went through a super religious phase in high school, but I never really believed in god, I just did it 
        |or my parents. I tried damn hard though. lol


        |I was kind of the same way. I think it was because I hated getting up on Sundays early. And Football on Sundays made it
        |worse, because I wanted to watch Football. I don't think I ever stopped believing in God, more so rebelled on getting u
        | early, but in my mind I stopped believing. ////I now made a pact with my self that I would go every OTHER Sunday to Su
        |day mass. Happily Religious now.  


        |I had that phase in high school too and now I have very little idea what my beliefs actually are other than that there 
        |s some higher power somewhere that is probably a bit pissed at the way we are living and abusing our home :/ ////I thin
        | religion gets in the way of people being good (like said religions state) because everyone likes to think they are rig
        |t and will relentlessly try to convert others. 


        |The question was for ex-atheists...


            |Yes, I know. I was an atheist, and now, I'm not. That makes me an ex-atheist.


                |No, you weren't. If you never truly stopped believing in God, you were never a real Atheist. You *claimed* to b
                | an Atheist, much like I *claimed* to be a Seventh-Day Adventist, but wasn't truly one.


                    |You know what? You weren't an atheist either. So there. 


                |You said yourself that you never lacked a belief in god, which is literally the only universal trait of atheist
                |.


                    |Yes, I know. I thought I did though. I thought I was a non-believer. It wasn't until later in my life that 
                    | realized that I never really stopped believing. 


    |The process of getting a physics degree helped a ton. The more I looked at things at a quantum level the more it became dif
    |icult to believe things weren't by design.


        |Wow. I'd love for you to elaborate here. I want to hear what you have to say about this.


            |He's been paying attention to too much Deepak Chopra.////Aliens Guy: "QUANTUM"


        |Very curious. Almost every physicist (or physics student) I know is non-religious. Most people I talk to say that physi
        |s has made them less religious.


            |My study of chemistry and physics, while I started Christian, has only solidified what I believe, not the opposite.


                |But it just begs the question, "who designed the designer." There's likely very good reasons for the Universe b
                |ing the way it is with the physical laws that we have. We just don't quite yet have the means (and may never) t
                | investigate those processes. If there's one argument I cannot stand it's, "For the lack of a better answer, it
                |must be a creator." Or, "It looks complex, it must have been created." Or, "Oh, God lives outside the realm of 
                |he natural and just always *has been*." It just begins to sound more and more ridiculous to me.////My study of 
                |hysics and biochemistry has reinforced my lack of belief, but then again, I've pretty much always identified as
                |agnostic. 


                    |It doesn't. He's self reliant. There's nothing before him, because he created time.


                        |I've tried to grapple with that idea many times. It just doesn't make any sense. Does it honestly make 
                        |ense to you? How does something "create time"? How does something just "exist"? And not just exist, but
                        |somehow be incredibly complex?//// 


                            |It doesn't completely make sense to me, but that doesn't really matter. Whether you believe in God 
                            |r not, you can't believe that time as we know it has always existed. Gravitational and velocital ti
                            |e dilation show that time is a component of the universe in the same way that space and matter and 
                            |nergy are. If you don't believe in God, you still have to believe in the existence of something tha
                            | is independent of time, or an action that caused the reaction (reaction referring to the universe 
                            |nd time).


        |Huh. As someone with a physics degree, it only helped reinforce my lack of belief. What in particular made you think th
        |re must have been some intelligent design to the universe? To me, the question of 'why' or 'how' is not at this point k
        |owable. To suppose the existence of some intelligent designer who made everything this way isn't to me any more satisfy
        |ng than supposing it just happened somehow.////Ultimately, the introduction of a God or intelligent designer doesn't ev
        |n answer any of the questions it was meant to explain. It just shifts them back a level. Now you ask, 'why and how does
        |God exist?' As far as I can tell most religious people at this point say something like 'God just is'. Well how is that
        |any more satisfying than 'the Universe just is'?////I don't mean to sound critical, I just am legitimately curious to h
        |ar how a religious person answers these questions, since they seem so obvious to me.


            |According to most, God is outside the spacetime continuum. That may not be satisfying for science, but it's possibl
            | to fathom such thing. 


                |Sure, but that doesn't answer my question. When you suppose 'God did it', well, who was God? Where did he come 
                |rom? Why did he make our universe? You don't answer any questions, you just get new ones. So how is it a satisf
                |ing 'answer' to you?////Not trying to disprove your beliefs, just curious as to your answer to that, because I 
                |ant to understand why some people don't find this compelling. ////Edit: just saw you're not the person I was re
                |lying to. 


                    |Well the way I like to think of it is that understanding God IS understanding the universe////I study physi
                    |s and I am religious. I believe in a higher power, but I dont necessarily know or even think I can speculat
                    | as to whether this higher power is human-like in anyway. All I know is that I see a universe that has been
                    |created and exists around me. There are certain rules to this universe that I understand through physical p
                    |inciples. By coming to learn more about how this these principles operate, I feel as if I am coming closer 
                    |nto understanding of how this whole entire universe works and to me that kind of feels like the same as und
                    |rstanding how this concept many people would call "God" works too. So I actually see a lot of compatibility
                    |between faith and science. There are a lot of things in science that we still take on faith for the time be
                    |ng while we try to figure out how to better understand them. There are a number of phenomena in science tha
                    | we know are just there and they seem to work the way we expect them to, yet we still dont know how or wher
                    | they come from. I think this can be considered taking something on faith in a way, albeit a different way 
                    |rom religion. In the end, I think studying science and physical principles helps strengthen my faith becaus
                    | it shows and reveals to me that there seems to some sort of inherent structure and I guess you could say o
                    |erational rules to which the universe works.


                    |You should not look for answers from people who believe. Look for them in the holy writings, those exist to
                    |serve this very purpose. My humble understanding of those writings is that we exist to worship God. We have
                    |to do it in a context that is highly likely to turn us away from faith and worshiping. The point of life as
                    |we know it is to get the closest we can to our creator. In the afterlife you will remain however close you 
                    |anaged to get  and as you finally understand the WHYs you  are forever ( or not, could not figure that out)
                    |drowned in regrets or joy depending on your situation. //So from my understanding it is very normal not to 
                    |e able to figure out the WHYs on our own. There wouldnt be any testing possible if we knew. WHy are we test
                    |d ? former logic applies there too.//Hope my opinion helped you see the point of view of a believer but the
                    | again you should check out the holy writings.


                |I'd really, *really* like it if someone would draw a distinction between outside-the-spacetime-continuum and fi

                    |iction, but that is okay with people like me who think that way, because it's an innocent though process. Y

                    |mitive apes' collective curiosity or their scientific thinking? Because science so far has explained everyt
                    |ing up to the big bang, and it may be possible that everything *just is*  by the 'big crunch' theory. Maybe

            |My friend is doing his senior thesis on a topic very similar to this. At a quantum level, events occur because wave
            |unctions collapse into states. What determines how they collapse? It's not hard at all to see that there might be a
            | outside influence. Another topic he's dealing with is randomness. I'm not sure I'm fully equipped to talk about th
            |s part, but it basically boils down to a simple question: in truly random events, who decides how they play out? Th
            | interesting (and most substantial) part of his paper deals with how quantum effects can easily add up to macroscop
            |c effects. He used a metaphor: if one were to release an identical amount of something like anthrax in a shopping m
            |ll under identical conditions several different times, the events (aka casualties) would be different every time. W
            |at determines how the scenario plays out? 


                |It seems totally reasonable to me to argue that it is *possible* that some God-like thing controls the outcome 
                |f quantum events, but it seems totally unmotivated. Perhaps if we saw evidence of something like [Maxwell's Dem
                |n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_demon) influencing the world we could say there is reason to think th
                |re is some hidden power at work, but in reality the best we can tell is that it is somehow truly random.////But
                |again, what questions would this answer? What would make it a more satisfying answer than 'it's just random and
                |we don't really know why yet'?


        |Why do you think so many physicists disagree with that?

        |I agree. I have a background in the natural sciences and once you see the incredible complexity of life- all the compon

        |d in the clouds out there, but I do believe that there is a designing force that is completely good and we are directly
        |connected to that force and a part of it. We all want to be able to break it down and see how it works exactly but I wo
        |der if this can be done. We understand some of the mechanisms of life and we can manipulate and use them to our own end
        |. But could we ever really understand the force that organizes us? Not that we don't try or that I would not want us to

            |Wow, for someone with a background in the natural sciences, you are wholly ignorant of the unifying theory of biolo
            |y: evolution. ////The most fundamental concept of evolution is natural selection. Selection is argued to be the ess
            |ntial and *non-random* process that turns the gears of the evolutionary process. So I agree with you, I don't belie
            |e the eye formed completely randomly, nor do I believe the eyeball just happened to form itself. Truth is, no biolo
            |ist that accepts evolution thinks so either. ////Where is the evidence for this "mysterious force" that assembles o
            |ganisms/complexity? Oh right, it's called physical laws that every known thing to man has to obey. That doesn't mea
            | nature cannot be creative.


                |Nice. Wholly ignorant? Really? LOL. It's a little mind boggling why you would even write that.////I believe tha
                | evolution is part of the process of how whatever designing force that is out there produces results (ie. my ey
                |ball, etc) and adapts to surrounding conditions. Evolution is a fact. It does not in an of itself disprove the 
                |xistence of a driving force outside itself. As I stated, I don't pretend to understand the force behind the cre
                |tive process. We generally accept the big bang theory to be a reasonable theory based on the evidence. That mea

                | you and I do not understand. I look around and see the awesome complexity and beauty of the life that is aroun
                | me and do question: is this all just some happy freak accident that was in no way connected to a higher creati
                |e force? My opinion is no. We look at power in the context of our selfish beings. I believe that the higher pow
                |r I believe in is literally the definition of good. So much so that I wonder if I can even hope to understand i
                | in my human/ fallible form. ////Completely understand the desire for proof. We all desire a logical rational e
                |planation for things, mainly so we can control them. What if we can't know the mind of a creative force? And ju
                |t like another poster stated- it would be just pure ego to think we could? I do not have the answer, only quest
                |ons. I think the problem is that we all want to be in complete absolute control and we reject anything else. I 
                |an study the world around me and use what I find to make my life better though controlling what I find. But I'm
                |under no illusion that I understand or ever could understand the force I believe exists that in the most purely
                |good way possible set it all in motion.


            |Why ever invoke the supernatural? Wouldn't that lead to even tougher questions? It seems as though you're importing
            |a purpose into what is observed. With a background in natural sciences, I would hope that you would use the sci met
            |od (methodological naturalism) to come to your conclusions. 


                |scientific method ≠ methodological naturalism////Naturalism is a faith-based belief.  The scientific method is 
                |he execution of a discrete series of steps, requiring no faith. 


                    |&gt; Naturalism is a faith-based belief. ////I disagree with this. I guess it would be true if one accepted
                    |the presupposition that an a priori rejection of the supernatural is taken on faith. However, one then must
                    |define faith and explain how 'faith' is a better term than TRUST. 


                        |lol. 


                    |You're right. To clarify: ////"Methodological naturalism is the label for the required assumption of philos
                    |phical naturalism when working with the scientific method. Methodological naturalists limit their scientifi
                    | research to the study of natural causes, because any attempts to define causal relationships with the supe
                    |natural are never fruitful, and result in the creation of scientific "dead ends" and God of the gaps-type h
                    |potheses. To avoid these traps scientists assume that all causes are empirical and naturalistic; which mean
                    | they can be measured, quantified and studied methodically."


                        |I understand methodological naturalism.  It's unnecessary and harmful to foist a belief system upon the
                        |execution of the scientific method (a method of generating and evaluating predictions regarding the nat
                        |ral world), which is compatible with any and all beliefs regarding the supernatural (*super*natural mea

        |So you drew a conclusion based on no evidence, despite your entire field being centered around studying the unknown and
        |drawing conclusions using *solid evidence*? What? You are the type of people that baffle me. But I suppose if you want 
        |o believe, you're going to find a way to do it.


        |Same. I'm only in my Freshman year of my Physics Education degree, but I had a bit of quantum in high school and while 
        |'m not strictly religious, it's certainly made me more open to the possibility.


        |I just began my physics education, but I feel the same way. I don't say I'm any type of specific religion, but I feel t
        |ere is something else out there. It's like were learning how God did it all.


    |I read St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologicae and it blew my mind. I realized I had this other side of my intellect I was no
    | tapping into. Faith and Reason together nothing but complement each other, and if you want the truth, one can't be without
    |the other. I came to this realization (along with the philosophical proof of the existence of a soul and the arguments for 
    |he existence of God all found in Summa Theologicae). After time, it became very personal, so I found the Catholic Church. I
    |firmly believe in the existence of God to the point where atheism sounds like pure insanity at this point..But I have been 
    |here so I understand.


    |I grew up in a very secular household. My parents, as Chinese immigrants who lived through stuff like the Cultural Revoluti
    |n, were sort of disenchanted with established religion and never really did anything religious when I grew up. The most I c
    |n remember is putting up a few screens for feng shui and telling me about Dao, which was more superstition than anything el
    |e.  ////I grew up very much as a child of the times, of science and internet. Doing that, I grew up to be a pretty heavy at
    |eist. But I always wanted to understand stuff and appreciate everything, and as I read more into religions and thought abou
    | it more I realized that man can't survive on reason alone. That humans need fulfillment in all sorts of ways, including wa
    |s that aren't material and empirically proven. We need to be happy, and to believe in *something,* whether that be the Bibl
    | or the Constitution or glorious revolution. I understood that giving yourself completely up to something or someone was an
    |experience great enough to change the course of history. In religion were attempts to answer the questions humanity had alw
    |ys had, and will probably never be able to answer.  ////So from when I was about 16, I began to want to find a religion to 
    |dhere to, and it only began to grow. I wanted to believe in something, to fully invest myself in it, and society had told m
    | how well that works out when you pick stuff like your job to base your life around. I guess I also wanted to feel spiritua
    | contentment, whatever that may mean. So I floundered about for a few more years, calling myself an atheist or an agnostic 
    |t varying times, until I found something I agreed with philosophically and everything.  //// I'd always liked Islam, in it'
    | most ideal form, and the history that came with it was also so interesting. I went looking around Mosques and schools to h
    |lp me get into it, and even if I'm pretty shit at Arabic, it's a nice thing.


        |&gt; I'd always liked Islam, in it's most ideal form,////Heh, I'm half-Chinese and converted. XD Glad to hear this.

                |ventually adopted the extreme christian thing.  He tossed out all of his Discover magazines and NAT GEOs becaus
                | in his words they were "liberal atheist trash" and now his shelves are full of Creation Magazine.  He's an aer

                        |on us (her kids), and never really talked about it. I asked her why recently and she just looked at me 
                        |nd said "Faith is faith. There will never be proof, which is why they call it faith. You either have it
                        |or you don't, it's a personal decision, and nothing I say will change your mind. Best I can do is intro
                        |uce you, but the next step is yours."////As someone who went from atheist to theist, it just is impossi

                    |As a Christian, I've noticed any brief relevant mention of religion ends up becoming a huge debate about ho
                    | I should not be. ////...so I don't blame people for not wanting to deal with that.


                        |Gosh, that sounds terrible! Being a part of the largest religious group in the US must be really rough!

                |There have been threads like that with many more answers, but they all just ended up with atheists calling out 
                |heir former colleagues for how stupid/delusional/sheeple they are.


                    |I wish this was just a reddit thing. I remember Dawkins going ballistic over Antony Flew's conversion to de
                    |sm. Honestly I know fundamentalists who treat their ex-converts with more grace and cordiality than the New
                    |Atheists (which, in this context, includes ratheists).


                |It happens more than you think. Why would some one tell you that they turned into a thiest if you are athiest? 
                |hey probably think you just wouldn't care if they told you, so that's probably why it's rare for you to see it.


                |Not about me, but my grandma had to flee Spain during the civil war. Her dad had been excomunicated for being "
                | communist" (he was just a math teacher and intellectualism was never cool with fascist dictatorships). She end
                |d up pretty messed up from the war but it wasn't until her last year of life, when she was "alone" that she sta
                |ted believing in God and got baptized because of her fear of death. My dad an I have always been kind of "douch
                |bag" atheists like she was, but since then we realize how easily things can change about one's spirituality.


                |I am an atheist --&gt; Catholic


            |It really bugs me when people say that they went from atheist to agnostic   because they almost always say somethin
            | like "We'll never now for sure ever so being an atheist is just like being a theist," but atheism isn't the belief
            |there is no god, atheism is the LACK of belief in god; it's not a claim, it's a rejection of a claim.


            |in the interests of education reddit, please remember to use a/theist and a/gnostic terms correctly and clearly. A/
            |heism is such a hot topic on reddit its important for everyone to understand the lingo.////[Here is an easy chart (

            | clearing some things up to most people.  In my experience most self proclaimed "agnostics" are actually agnostic a
            |heists and most atheists are agnostic-atheists.


            |The times I hear about this happen IRL is after a huge life changing event like almost dying. 


            |Those two terms are not mutually exclusive.  Atheist/theist have to do with belief, while agnostic/gnostic has to d
            | with knowledge.


            |I'm atheist-Christian and then specifically into Catholicism.  ////But I was raised Baptist, and was only an atheis
            | as a teenager, so most of the time when these discussions pop up, I get all kinds of "You were never an atheist!" 
            |rap, so I haven't bothered.////That said, if you have any questions, I'll do my best.  Gotta leave for work in 20 m
            |ns though.  


        |I'm Catholic... I don't mention it much on reddit. I'm not ashamed, but it's usually pointless as people react negative
        |y. If there's enough backlash for me, I think the stigma against an atheist-turned-theist here would be even worse!


            |Protestant here. I think we're supposed to be fighting about something. How's Tuesday at 2:00 work for you?

                    |You. I like you. 


                    |Say, every day is that.  Get to work, I'll need a report in the morning.

                |Haha this got me


            |I'm with you. It's not too bad. Catholics tend to be better educated in the faith than most Christians, so I find m
            |self actually equipped for debate instead of being a Facebook Theist, copying memes that sound nice. ////Funnily en
            |ugh, /r/atheism seems to be a direct parallel to the Facebook Theists. 


                |I'm an atheist who loves the occasional debate, and I always enjoy debating Catholics much more than Protestant
                |. You're generally more informed on stuff in the faith, and are almost always a lot more liberal (I don't have 
                |o worry about being preached to about how my bisexuality is sinful, how I should look for Jesus, etc. etc.) You
                |re all very good at being civil and logical in debates. And your current boss is pretty awesome, compared to al
                | the other ones, at least. I'm pretty OK in general with Catholicism. Granted, I live in America, and all the c
                |azy Evangelicals are generally Reform Baptist or Presbyterian, so I don't experience any sort of bad Catholicis
                | on a day-to-day basis. 


                    |I think the reason behind this is that there's this entire fairly major yet oddly unknown part of Church tr
                    |dition called Catholic Social Teaching, and while it does go through the whole "life is sacred" bit at one 
                    |oint, most of it is actually focused on doing shit like helping the poor and the ethics of capitalism and t
                    |e responsibilities of a government to its people and what a 'just war' entails. ////Plus the fact that Cath
                    |licism is verrrry big on the whole "what you did for the least of my brothers you did for me" aspect of Jes
                    |s' teachings, most Catholics (including me) always fall on the more liberal side of the scale. The Church, 
                    |nd by extension most Catholics, is actually totally behind stuff like the DREAM Act and the ACA and expandi
                    |g programs to help the poor. And when it comes to stuff like gay marriage and whatnot, most Catholic people
                    |I've met either support it fully or they say something to the effect of "I don't agree with it but I unders
                    |and and accept it." Hell, at one of my Jesuit high school's masses, one of the petitions was for those oppr
                    |ssed due to race, gender, sex, and orientation. ////Tl:dr--what the Church says and what people actually do
                    |think are very different. 


                |Honestly, most Catholics I know are completely rational and reasonable, and don't have anything against the irr
                |ligious. Hell, the Catholic Church on a local level provides an amazing community where young people and adults
                |alike can come together and grow. Catholic churches fund a ton of charities, and won't hesitate to help you. //
                |/Really, /r/atheism's problem with religion is that they see every non-atheist as out to get them or destroy se
                |ular government. I'm an American Catholic, and I know that America -was- founded as a nation without an officia
                | religion. Just because people believe homosexuality is a sin does not mean gay marriage should be illegal. Hel
                |, you could make an argument that making it illegal is hampering God's gift of free will. 


                    |Just curious- I'm an American Catholic, and until I got to college I was very happy with it. I'm still impr
                    |ssed by their charity and community work. But I have trouble believing that homosexuality is a sin, or that
                    |premarital sex/birth control is a sin. The emphasis on that at mass has slowly been driving me away from th
                    | church. Have you ever had that experience? I don't want to leave the church, but I don't know if I still b
                    |long there when I disagree with so many of their beliefs. ////Also, I found out I have celiacs, so I can't 
                    |ake communion either way : / 


                        |To be quite honest, that's always the most difficult part of catholicism. I believe that the chief reas
                        |n as to why humans can enjoy sex is for procreation, and from a biological position, homosexuality is b
                        |sically a form of population control. From a theological perspective, acting on sexual urges in a homos
                        |xual way, which ignores the most basic elemental of procreation, man and woman, is an affront against G
                        |d's design. However, in secular America, it is for the betterment of everyone for homosexuals to be all
                        |wed to marry, and even adopt, as a child will usually do better with a homosexual couple who wants to r
                        |ise a child over the often sad care of foster homes. ////As for contraception and heterosexual sodomy, 
                        | cannot say. It follows the same  thought process as homosexuality, only it is between two people who t
                        |chnically can have a child. In my personal belief, it is a minor, inconsequencial thing, as the parents
                        |clearly do not want to bring life into this workd at that moment, and it would be much more beneficial 
                        |o start a family when ready, thus bringing a child into a stable, loving family.////Disagreement with t
                        |e Church is not something worth leaving it. Even the Vatican is staffed by mortals, and their interpret
                        |tion of God's plans may change as we discover more of this world. ////I'd type more but im on my phone,
                        |so hoped this helps a bit. 


                        |My priest explained to me that his main problem with homosexual marriage is the definition of marriage.
                        | He thinks that the fact that they are together is fine, but they shouldn't call their relationship a m
                        |rriage because it doesn't fit the description of the majority of definitions for marriage.  I think in 
                        |rder to stop this,  the definition of marriage should change.  I know, however, that many people believ
                        | that gay relationships defy God's plan for procreation of the human race, but those seem to be the mor
                        | fundamentalist Christians that take the Bible word for word.


                |From what I heard, /r/atheism used to be a place where atheists discussed with and debated with theists, someti
                |es seriously, other times satirically. But, after a lot of religious people protested about its content, they w
                |re able to get mod status, which, while not getting rid of the page, effectively neutered it, reducing it to me
                |es instead of a place for intelligent discussion. Though I'm not entirely sure if this is correct, would apprec
                |ate it if somebody could confirm.


                    |Nah. /r/atheism used to be somewhat more meme-oriented thanks to no moderation rules (and thus, like all ot
                    |er defaults, the lowest common denominator of content rose to the top). Recently it was undefaulted and ima
                    |e spam was banned in a fairly controversial move, but regardless of the motivations there the content has d
                    |finitely improved.////The vast majority of people bashing /r/atheism have little clue what it looks like ri
                    |ht now, and I wouldn't be surprised if many of them have never actually been there for more than 5 seconds 
                    |ven before the rule changes. It's actually a remarkably civil subreddit for most things and probably the be
                    |t subreddit I've seen of its size (most subreddits crater after a few thousand/a few tens of thousands of s
                    |bs), although it has a habit of spiraling into islamophobia similar to what you'd expect from /r/worldnews,
                    |/r/politics etc in relevant threads.


            |I'm a catholic redditor too but I find its usually not worth the negative karma.


            |Similar, I am a fellow Catholic evolutionary biologist med student striving to live out the faith.////Yep, I believ
            | it all (in case anyone was wondering).


            |When I mention I'm atheist in other threads, I usually get endless "SO BRAVE" "back to/r/atheism withyou" type comm
            |nts, too. I think religion/lack thereof in general has become a lose-lose topic across reddit at this point.


            |This is based on what exactly? Your laughably demented view of atheists you just tacitly accented to? That's a grea
            | base. . . The majority of atheists I know wouldn't give a shit, all they care is that their kids are happy and hea
            |thy, unless it's a demonstrably unhappy unhealthy cult (say ... like Scientology) it's a big 'meh'. 


            |catholics are disgusting human beings for participating in that horrid institution.


        |To be fair though, the selection here is probably not full of ex-atheists. 


        |ITT: "I'm an agnostic."


            |A lot of people that don't understand that agnostic and atheist aren't on the same scale. You either believe or you
            |don't. There is no middle ground. Not believing is not the same as believing there isn't. [True] and [false] is not
            |a dichotomy, but [true] and [not true] are. This is the same with [false] and [not false], but [not false] is not t
            |e same as [true] just as [not true] not the same as [false]. If you don't believe that something is correct then yo
            | are an atheist with respect to that claim.////Agnostics claim that they don't/can't/or have no way of knowing the 
            |nswer, where gnostics do. This isn't in conflict with atheism/theism as plenty of theists and atheists alike are ag
            |ostic, but still hold to their belief or lack of belief in said claim.


                |Yep, agnostics are jsut atheist wanting to sound more politically correct.////You either believe or you don't, 
                |I don't know if I believe or I don't" sounds absolutely retarded.


            |ITT: "I don't know the difference between agnostic atheist and gnostic atheist", more precisely.////Almost everyone
            |is an agnostic atheist, some very strongly agnostic.////But to claim you are a gnostic, either one way or another, 
            |robably requires you to experience death without afterlife (and meeting any deities), or meeting said deity.


        |*On Reddit


        |I'd actually argue that every religious person is an ex-atheist. You're not born with a religion after all.


        |You don't find too many ex-non-Santa believers either. Generally, once you see why Santa is not real it is unlikely to 
        |tart believing in him again.  


            |I have never heard that analogy before and it makes perfect sense.


        |Oh yeah me too.  I was expecting to see screens of "scientists can't explain this, and scientists can't explain that, a

        |////Weak stuff here.  Totally weak.


        |The reason is that atheism is one of those things you can't unsee.


        |Those that do often didn't understand atheism.


        |And quite a few of them seem to be people who were raised atheist, but found religion somehow when they reached adultho

                |I am not talking about your personal anecdotal evidence, just saying reddit isn't the whole world.


                    |Of course not be I have to believe that there are not too many ex-atheists anywhere in the world.  There we

                            |For sure it is.  That is all I have.  That said in my almost 40 years on this earth I encountered 1

        |Late to this thread; I was at church. (Kidding, but, um, really. That's where I was.)////As I think is often the case w
        |th Reddit atheists, I grew up in a church in the Bible Belt and often saw mean-spirited, stupid people braying their be
        |iefs, insisting that one had to be "saved" or go to hell, all the while betraying much of Jesus' core message. As a tee
        |ager, I decided that whatever those people were, I was certainly something else. By the time I started college, I was p
        |etty virulently anti-religious, largely as a way of asserting my intellectual independence. If I knew about Reddit at t
        |e time, I probably would have been a huge /r/atheism presence.////After a while, I mellowed out. I realized that no mat
        |er what you believe, the some books of the Bible are profound literature. I began treating the Bible as myth—not someth
        |ng necessarily literally true, but as mysterious old stories with core truths—and it started making a lot more sense. I
        |reread Old Testament stories as an adult, heard the echo of them from my childhood, and found them chillingly beautiful
        | I reread the Gospels, and was shook hard by the story of an omnipotent God who loved humanity so much, he channeled hi

        |ll. It's a powerful idea.////Also, while I grew up in a church and I knew tons of awful "Christians," the paths of thos
        | two rarely crossed. Most of the people in my home church are incredibly nice and good people, who spend their weekends
        |visiting the sick in the hospital, or building houses for the poor or working in soup kitchens. This goodness was stari
        |g me in the face for all my youth, and I dared conflate them with the evangelical mouth breathers I think everyone in t
        |is thread dislikes. I think most anti-theists make a similar confusion.////It's impossible to articulate, but something
        |in the beauty of that message *spoke* to me. I have my own belief system, mostly rooted in my own understanding of the 
        |ible. It probably doesn't exactly align with any of the established branches of Protestantism. That's ok; several branc
        |es' service come close enough. There's plenty I could say about it, but I won't bore you guys here.

    |Hi, I'm actually one of these! ^(oh god please be kind)////For most of my life (maybe 24 years) I was an atheist, and was r
    |ised as an atheist by both of my parents. But I'm also a person who is constantly questioning things -- especially my belie
    |s -- to see if they're consistent and I actually believe the things I think I believe. I want to be able to say "I believe 
    | am X, not because I was raised X, but because I've actually thought about it for a long time and I believe this to be true
    |"////After contemplating the religious question for years, my beliefs slowly began to change. I still don't believe in Chri
    |tianity (or really any religion that believes in an active and intervening creator), but I also started to diverge from som
    | of the logic that follows atheism. Ultimately I started believing something remotely similar to deism -- that some unknown
    |omnipotent being (or beings!) created the universe then left it alone. That's really the extent of my belief system, and wh
    |tever faith in God I have. I don't believe in an afterlife, in an intervening god, in a christian God, etc. Quite literally
    |my entire belief system is that something -- something unknowable but definitely something -- caused the Big Bang. I've nev
    |r really felt comfortable extending my beliefs beyond that. 


        |&gt; I've never really felt comfortable extending my beliefs beyond that. ////You just sound like a normal atheist. The
        |e is /r/atheism atheist, and then there is you, just a normal, simple atheist. I get very uncomfortable talking about R
        |ligion, even though I am Christian. 


        |Non-denominational Christian here, I don't know how I feel about an active or intervening creator either. I think the G
        |d of the Old-Testament probably went out and did his thing, but as things stand right now post-Jesus and all that, I th
        |nk he's been quite laissez-faire with this whole Earth thing. That's just how I, and a lot of other Christians see it, 
        |ust wanted to point that out. 


            |Yeah, all the miracles happened before the advent of recording devices. 


                |TBH, I see matters of faith in the same light as the pandora's box of quantum mechanics.  Measurement will affe
                |t the nature of the event and proof of God would negate the concept of Faith.  There is even a story or 2 about
                |this concept when a disciple asks Jesus to prove himself so people could believe and be saved. He declines, and
                |also lets his disciples know that more is expected of them since they have seen his miracles.


        |Maybe with a more complete scientific understanding, you would see no need for a creator or creators in your worldview?
        | Just asking...


            |Perhaps with a better understanding of God, you wouldn't need to reconcile a conflict between science and religion 
            |hat doesn't exist.


                |Maybe with a full and open-minded re-reading of my comment and the comment I was responding to, you'd see that 
                | never mentioned a "conflict" and was conversing within the logical parameters of their unique situation.  If y
                |u want to make this about me and my beliefs, you'll first have to gain some insight on what I actually do belie
                |e.  Good luck!


        |That just sounds like you're filling in knowledge science doesn't know yet with a god. The question is, why? Why is it 
        |ore logical to say "this was a god" rather than we just don't know? There are many ideas people come up with that more 
        |t least somewhat consistent with the science we understand (albeit also just stuff theoretical scientists come up with,
        |not theories or anything). And at least some of those ideas are plausible under the laws of physics. A deity would have
        |to break the laws of physics. Which, I suppose, is also plausible if they live outside of our universe, in some other u
        |iverse. But then they aren't really gods, are they? They're just aliens that we call gods.

        |Hmm, I just asked this of another poster.////http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nu1kd/exatheists_of_reddit_why
        |did_you_change_your/ccm7ic3////Briefly, how does the introduction of some unknown omnipotent being answer any questions
        |for you? To me it would just create more questions. "Where did the deities come from?" "Why/how did they make our unive
        |se?" "Why did they leave it alone afterwards?".


        |I've never understood this. The hangup seems to be "but who DID IT?" Why did somebody have to *do it*? How does that ma
        |e any more or less sense than "everything just is"?


            |&gt;more or less sense////And finally, someone hits the nail on the head. People love to talk about how a God or cr
            |ator or whatever coming into being doesn't make sense, but they don't really consider the fact that everything just
            |being there doesn't make any more sense.


                |But only one of those posits an explanation, invents a thing that wasn't there before. Admitting that there's n
                | explanation is sensible and true. "God must be the explanation" is not an idea that exists in a vacuum, it com
                |s from either the existence of gods in our culture, or the human desire to invent explanations for things we do
                |'t understand.

                    | you believe that there's always been a creator, that a creator came into existence at some point, that the
                    |e's always been energy/matter/whatever, or that at some point that stuff came into existence. Either with o
                    | without a creator, you've gotta invent something that didn't exist before or assume something's existed li

                    |it couldn't be just that it comes from the existence of gods in our culture. And it doesn't really do much 
                    |o explain things we don't understand, since it creates other things we don't understand, like "where the he
                    |l did God come from?"


                        |What gets invented is a will. A force of will that MADE everything happen. It's a very human idea, that
                        |the universe couldn't possibly just be this eternal throb that doesn't need someone to flip the lightsw
                        |tch. We want everything to have a story.////When you look at old polytheistic religions it's pretty eas
                        | to see how the idea of gods can come from trying to explain stuff. I agree that it doesn't really do a
                        |ything to explain anything (especially if one admits that if God DID exist we couldn't possibly underst
                        |nd the first thing about it) but that doesn't seem to matter at all to most people. "God did it, the en
                        |" and then they don't really think too much about it after that. Which I get, existential nausea isn't 
                        |he most pleasant state of mind.


                            |&gt;I agree that it doesn't really do anything to explain anything but that doesn't seem to matter

                            | started thinking that people were actually rational. In fact, people just tend to stop thinking on
                            |e they find something they like (in all contexts; not just religion).////&gt;What gets invented is 
                            | will////Ahh. I was misunderstanding you. But I'd posit that that argument only works for people wh
                            | don't already believe in God.////For the people who *do* believe in God, He exists just as much as
                            |the universe does. You're not inventing a concept, because God is real. And it's true, they're gene
                            |ally relying more on faith and/or just filling in gaps in the unexplained and such. But for them, t
                            |at's enough, because (and I think we're kind of coming full circle here) it's just as easy, and pos
                            |ibly more comfortable, to believe God did it as it is to believe that everything just magically is 
                            |nd always will be. Basically, God just kind of ties it all up into a neat little package.


                                |Well that's kinda what I mean. In a vacuum where you don't make the assumption that God exists,
                                |"God did it" invents a concept where "stuff just appears to exist" does not.


                |For me, the idea of energy always existing seems more probable than the idea of a complex conscious having alwa

        |Curious why you feel the need to attribute the creation of the universe to "some unknown omnipotent being (or beings!)"
        |  If it's because you need a beginning, then you must also ask what created the omnipotent beings?  If you don't need a
        | answer to that question, why do you need the omnipotent beings at all?


            |Speaking for myself (I'm not religious, but have reasoned that there is *hopefully*, and I believe there probably *
            |s*, a God)- I often wander down perplexing philosophical chains of thought.////One is where I think of death (or ra
            |her the *non-existence* of my consciousness) as the truly natural state of the universe. It existed for the vast ex
            |anse before and *after* my current state of awareness. In that light (and in the absence of design) my life is a ti
            |y anomaly which, in the grand scheme of things is rather pointless. Really, for me- I cannot reason why someone who
            |is an atheist wouldn't correct this anomaly and simply end their life. Without that faith of continuance or at leas
            | *glimmer* of hope.. What's the point really? ////We all share this odd state of "being".. this "consciousness". It
            |s a thing which exists beyond what was necessary for our species to have survived. How did we develop such complex 
            |equirements for entertainment and expression? For what purpose? I personally believe it's a self-preservation mecha
            |ism to keep ourselves from asking the above questions. The complexity of that solution however reinforces (for me) 
            |hat there's a grand design. Somehow, there's a force propelling life forward, against all odds. ////Some people are
            |able to ignore this type of thinking, or sufficiently answer the questions presented. I sorta envy them. I cannot l
            |ve on the surface so simply.////Because of this, I have reasoned that there *is* something. I have no idea if we've
            |even come close to conceptualizing what *It* is as humans. I'm fairly certain that most of the "Holy" books have it

                |It's not impossible to imagine a lot of stuff :)


                    |Just curious, do you have a belief about what prompted the big bang, or where the material/energy came from
                    | or how the fundamental subatomic structures came to be so prevalent?


                        |A belief?  Not really.  Perhaps it came from some form of a big crunch, perhaps from "nothing".  We rea
                        |ly have no way of knowing what was before, just observe and make predictions based off of what has come
                        |about since.


                |&gt; We've observed that the universe had a beginning.////Not really true. The only thing we have been able to 
                |educe is that the observable universe was once in a very small region that was very hot and very dense. This do
                |sn't say much about the entire universe or it's beginnings.


                |&gt;We've observed that the universe had a beginning.////This is incorrect.  We've observed that the current st
                |te of the universe had a beginning.  That is all we can say with certainty.////It's not hard for me to imagine 
                |n 8-dimensional 4th grader doing a science experiment on lower dimensional universes or an 11-dimensional Brane
                |collision in eternal space generating our universe, or that this state of the universe is one cycle in an endle
                |s cycle of bangs and crunches.


                |I, on the other hand, believe the "universe" had a beginning but that the universe is contained within the grea
                |er "existence" which is infinite and has always existed.  Existence is also a self-aware entity that manifests 
                |tself into things like the universe as a means for understanding itself.  So in my case, the self-aware entity 
                |s not "outside" of existence, it IS existence.


            |I don't "feel the need." It is not an emotional hole that is being filled, but a system of beliefs that help me exp
            |ain the world. My ultimate goal was to help me understand the world better. I feel no need for a god. I would be no
            |happier with or without one. I just want to sort the chaos.////Also to your second point, I don't suppose to have a
            |swers to the shape, form, ways, or number of gods that created the universe. Is there one god or many gods? Did one
            |god create other gods? How exactly does omnipotency work, anyways? These are incredibly important and interesting r
            |ligious/philosophical questions, but I don't think they're answerable. There is a limit to human knowledge and I th
            |nk trying to get specific about literally unknowable things is some sort of self-delusion and I'm uncomfortable doi
            |g that. So that's why I don't.////Also before anybody rings the irony alert button -- yes I realize that answering 
            |he question "What created the universe?" is also, quite literally, unknowable. Nobody can provide solid evidence on
            | way or the other to answer this question. We all have our observations, our experiences, and our instincts which i
            |form how we feel about it, but nobody has or will have solid evidence. I, too, lack solid evidence. All I have to i
            |form whatever "faith" I have are my observations, my experiences, and my instincts. But I also feel that anybody wh
            | has an answer to that question does it solely with observations, experiences, and instincts. And just as atheists 
            |re pulled very strongly and emotionally towards answering that question with "nothing caused it," I'm pulled very s
            |rongly and emotionally towards "something caused it." (I'm pretty sure what I'm describing is what people consider 
            |faith", but I'm new to it so it's weird and confusing).


                |Thanks for the response, just trying to understand from your perspective, and your answers were very helpful.//
                |/As an atheist, I wouldn't say I'm pulled emotionally towards answering "nothing caused it".  I've just come to
                |the conclusion that until evidence is presented that provides some insight into something being the cause, it's
                |illogical for me to feel strongly that a god did it.  I also understand that as humans, we're not fully in cont
                |ol of our feelings and emotions, so they can certainly impact our beliefs. 


                    |Fair and reasonable points all. ////These are hard questions with a lot of really good arguments on all sid
                    |s. 


            |Because people need a feeling of being able to explain what they can see and feel but do not have that need when it
            |comes to imaginary omnipotent creators.////Two completely different 'things'.


        |So, in your view, some deity or god or something was the cause for the big bang?  What caused this being, and what caus
        |d whatever caused that?  At which point do we decide that something out there was the uncaused cause?  Why does it have
        |to lie one step prior to the big bang?


            |Assuming you're an atheist, why does it have to lie *at* the Big Bang? Why does all the shit in the universe "just 
            |appening" make any more sense than some being "just becoming"?


                |It does not necessarily, but it seems silly to say that "the big bang could not be the uncaused cause, because 
                |ncaused causes do not make too much sense given our understanding of causality, so I posit that prior to the bi
                | bang, there was a different uncaused cause." Each posited uncaused cause makes as much sense in our understand
                |ng as the prior one.////Even then, deism can be so broad now that an uncaused cause can stand in as a deity.///
                |What I am saying is that you are introducing inexplicable additional variables in an attempt to explain what yo
                | view to be similarly inexplicable, each with the same logical problems associated with it.////So, it does not 
                |ave to lie at the big bang, but introducing something else prior to the big bang (inasmuch as time had meaning 
                |rior to the big bang) to explain it simply begs the question of what explains that thing.  Perhaps science will
                |one day say that something happened before the big bang.  Which will then beg the question of what caused that 
                |vent.////Also, I am not sure how you differentiate between "just becoming" and "just happening".


                    |So, Occam's Razor, basically? I think that's the most common answer. It really kind of depends on how you l
                    |ok at it, though, IMHO. Are the coming into being of a creator and a universe each just single "uncaused ca
                    |ses"? Or is the coming into being of a creator a single event and the coming into being of a universe reall
                    | trillions and trillions of distinct events, one for each component of the universe that was created? Or so
                    |ething else?////Hell if I know, but depending on how you look at it, one may or may not require more assump
                    |ions than the other.////&gt;I am not sure how you differentiate between "just becoming" and "just happening
                    |////Not much of a distinction, really. I just used different words because a creator is, in the spiritual s
                    |nse, generally considered to have "being." Matter, on the other hand, doesn't have that same being. It's ju
                    |t semantics.


        |So you're basically in the  agnostic spectrum then.


        |I like to think we're a pocket universe created by a science experiment done in another one.

        |But if that mysterious something were to reveal itself, what would it look like?


    |My parents took me to Quaker meeting until I was around 8 although they were atheists so I don't know if I count. ////I was
    |kind of learning more about the world and there were some things that just couldn't really be explained by science. I start
    |d reading the bible and started reading about Jesus and I started to really feel more comfortable with who I am. I just fee
    | really happy, whenever I read the bible, I feel more comfortable and relaxed and like if we were nicer and helped people m
    |re, like the bible says, then the world would be a much better place.////Sorry if this doesn't make sense, I wrote it on my
    |phone.


        |1000 years ago science didn't have an answer to a whole lot of things. People were kind of learning more about the worl
        |, and there were some things that just couldn't really be explained by science. And so they became religious.////Then w
        | figured LOTS of shit out. And we will figure LOTS more shit out. Food for thought.


            |There are as many holes in science as their are in religion. Don't be fooled.


                |Of course there are!////The difference is that science *admits* it. Science knows we are going to learn new thi
                |gs and that we should be flexible to current beliefs. Science doesn't denounce, exile, or threaten death upon p
                |ople who discover, say, that the sun is the center of our solar system.////That's the difference. I had just ma
                |e your very claim when I said that 1000 years ago, there was tons of stuff we don't know. 1000 years from now, 
                |opefully we know the answers to many scientific questions that the best and brightest minds are diligently work
                |ng on.////I'm thrilled that there are "holes in science". It makes me proud of the scientific method; namely th
                | part where we don't fill those holes in with bullshit, magic, and fantastical nonsense.


        |There are things that _haven't_ been explained by science.////But, as Tim Minchin wrote, "Throughout history, every mys
        |ery, ever sold, has turned out to be, **not magic**."////People being nice can even be done with science. Game theory h
        |s lots of optimum strategies which are cooperative, even altruistic.


            |Maybe science explains the cause of things and religion helps deal with the actual event emotionally?


                |Science can teach us what to do with emotions.


        |I get the same sense of comfort when I watch LOTR or smoke weed. Doesn't mean I believe in it. Things that we don't hav
        | explanations for cna't just all be explained as "god did it". That's what the church said about a lot of things back i
        | the day that have now been explained with science. Why not try to find a proper answer instead of saying "god did it"?
        |Why not prove that god did it? If you did I would think you were right. You know I also believed in god when I was eigh
        |. Then I started trying to find actual reasons for why things happened instead of just saying that god or santa did it.


        |While this makes sense for an eight year old, you should understand now that you don't need a book to tell you to be a 
        |ood person and help others. As an adult (I'm assuming) you should do it not to please a God but for the sake of helping
        |others.


            |OP said nothing about doing it for god. Sounds to me like the described experience is simply enlightening and uplif
            |ing.


                |Well he said because the bible told him so. As those people who follow the bible believe that it's his teaching
                | recorded by his followers, I assumed that by extension, the ultimate goal was to please God.


            |Why not both? Why can't he do it for God and to please others?


            |Of course he shouldn't need one. In a perfect world nobody should need a moral code to dictate their behavior. I gu
            |ss it's the same logic as reading motivational speeches to feel determined. If it makes him feel better and more mo

                |Thanks, but I'm already a Muslim. I just don't feel like I've been a very good one as of late, that's all.


        |Finally, an actual answer.


        |That's awesome bro! Salam


        |Are you fluent in Arabic? I think you know where this is going.


            |No, I don't speak Arabic at all. I know a few words and prayers now, but that is all. 


                |How do you feel about the idea that the Koran can only be understood in Arabic?//


                    |A false idea. The Qur'an can only be directly interpreted from Arabic as the primary source document was wr
                    |tten in Arabic, but it can be understood in all languages and forms of communication. 


                        |Just like the Bible being translated from Hebrew and Greek into English then? If I read the Koran in En
                        |lish, can I rightly criticize what it says? ////In the Bible, there are a lot of brutal books like Levi
                        |icus and Deuteronomy with instructions that Christians say do not apply any more, because of Jesus and 
                        |ocietal changes. Are there parts of the Koran that some interpret as not applicable any more? Or is all
                        |of it considered relevant to modern life?


                            |&gt;If I read the Koran in English, can I rightly criticize what it says?////If you read an accredi

                            |d. The Qur'an is just 1400 years old. It will always be considered relevant and wholly applicable i
                            | its entirety by Muslims, especially the spirit of its message. No part of it will ever be "irrelev
                            |nt" as some Christians may point to the Bible being. 


    |When I realized that God, nirvana, Brahman, Te and grace are just different terms to describe an experience, or feeling, of
    |complete and total oneness with all that is, has ever been, ever will be, ever could be; that memory is not what has passed

    |Agnostic here, believe atheists are probably right but have hope they are wrong as no one really knows...//////But one opin
    |on I have on this is, no one can choose to change.  You believe something or you do not.   If I tell you to believe in the 
    |ooth fairy, you cannot do so just by telling yourself to do so.////One of my biggest problems with Christian religions that
    |say you go to hell if you don't believe in god, it isn't my choice to not believe in their god, he just doesn't make sense 
    |o me, I can pretend I believe but nothing I tell myself will make me believe something I don't believe//


        |I think when most people say atheist, they mean the agnostic kind. Myself personally, while I am atheist (agnostic) I d
        |n't care at all, I jut live my life.


            |I believe the term for that is "apatheism".  Basically not caring if there is or isn't a god and just living life r
            |gardless.


                |I don't care or think about such matters much, but that's because I don't think we *could* know much about such
                |matters, based on the knowledge and technology we do have. So since people are speculating based on not enough 
                |nformation, I choose not to speculate, or care, since I don't think we could speculate accurately based on the 
                |nowledge we have at this stage.////Is that apatheism?


                    |I consider myself a fairly straight forward agnostic atheist and you may have a similar view to me.  I myse
                    |f am completely open to the idea of there being a God, but from what our human minds are capable of knowing
                    |and observing, there simply is just no evidence for any type of God that I can see.  Therefore, I cannot be
                    |ieve in one.  If evidence came forward, I would consider it and perhaps change my views but until then I re
                    |use to believe in something purely based on faith.  


                    |Your agnosticism is clear, but - in my opinion - since you don't actively believe in a god, you're squarely
                    |an atheist. You don't have to outright say "there is no god" to be one, the only qualification is not being
                    |a theist.


                    |I don't know but I like it. Q. What happens after you die? A. Nobody knows.


                    |Kind of.... that's actually near a sort of agnostic atheism. //////You expressed three slightly different c
                    |ncepts:// //"I don't care."  *Apathism*////"I don't think we can know if there is a god." *Agnosticism*////
                    |/"I see no reason to believe in god." *Agnostic Atheism*////


                    |I think that makes you agnostic.


                    |I think you're putting too much thought into it.  Apatheists just find the question "Is there a deity" irre
                    |evant and therefore don't care.


                        |The Buddha was apatheist then. When he was asked about God, he would say that they were asking the wron

                |I care.  It is hugely relevant if the things most religions claim is true.  I simply can't believe them because

                    |Agnostic, I guess.  Labelling people in this way is kinda hard.  These terms cover a lot of different minds

            |Often this is referred to as a tooth fairy atheist.  The tooth ferry could be real, but we don't waste our time wor

            |It is fairly pedantic to define it. I call myself an atheist but I would definitely believe in a god if I was convi

            |Same here. After leaving the Christian environment I was in about 4 years ago, I've lived my life not caring at all
            |about religion. It's a complete non-factor in my life. Although reading these threads is pretty interesting.

            |There are multiple types of belief. A simple belief (for this discussion) is when you act as if something is true a
            |d have the mental view of it being true.////Belief in belief is holding that it is virtuous or desirable to believe
            |something; this almost but not quite always leads to similar verbal behaviors as simple belief as well as some of t
            |e same actions, but the more costly (in terms of time and social status and money and all other resources) behavior
            | will probably be omitted.////Belief as attire is when you espouse something (similar to belief in belief) in order
            |to be associated with a group whose members typically espouse that belief. Belief as cheering is pretty similar, bu
            | with a goal of promoting or praising that group instead of necessarily trying to be marked as a member.////It's li
            |e [Sagan's dragon parable](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/The_Dragon_in_My_Garage) -- someone who believes the dragon
            |is there won't make excuses in advance. They won't say the dragon is invisible. Or if they do, they'll mention it i
            | advance. They'll be willing to help you come up with a test for the presence of the dragon.////Someone who simply 
            |elieves in the belief in the dragon will make the excuses and become increasingly uncomfortable as the discussion c

            |difficult. You have to decide that something else is more credible to yourself than you are, or you need actual evi
            |ence. You can force yourself into belief as attire or belief as cheering; that's mere behavior. You can change your
            |values in order to believe in belief; that's easier than changing your simple beliefs, but not easy.////&gt; So man
            | people think that faith comes in whenever you don't have evidence. That is not how I see it. Faith is confidence i
            | what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.////So if I hope that I'll get a new house, I should not h

            |ng in something you will first need confidence in what you hope for. In your case you hope that the atheists are wr
            |ng. What is the next step? You will have to study religion.////Good second step, but you're missing the third (assu
            |ing you're talking about simple belief) -- you need to look at reality to see if it matches what that religion pred
            |cts.////For instance, your religion states that its deity or deities or amorphous spiritual forces will protect and
            |heal adherents from injuries and maladies. You would then expect to see insurance companies asking what your religi
            |n is and giving you lower rates if you are a member of that religion. You'd expect doctors to prescribe that religi
            |n. You'd expect to go to communities where that religion is predominant and go to their school records and see fewe
            | absences per capita per year than in comparable communities elsewhere. And if you find that not to be true, that's
            |evidence against your religion.////Your religion states that some apocalyptic event is in the offing and specifies 
            |o date besides "soon". Every day that that doesn't happen is a grain of evidence against that religion.////To say o
            |herwise leaves you with two choices: abandon the laws of probability, or state that your religion's apocalypse comi
            |g today would not be evidence in favor of your religion, that if no adherent of your religion ever got sick or inju
            |ed, that would not be a point in favor of it.////Of course, you might try to get some other metric by which one can
            |evaluate candidates for simple beliefs other than evidence. This is what [Reformed Epistemology](http://plato.stanf
            |rd.edu/entries/religion-epistemology/#RefEpi) does, though Reformed Epistemology is problematic.////Or you might be
            |talking about belief in belief or belief as attire instead. That doesn't require evidence.

                |e. But everyone that has gone from theist to atheist or from atheist to theist has done just that. That is even
                |what the original poster was looking for.//&gt;For instance, your religion states that its deity or deities or

                |ies elsewhere. And if you find that not to be true, that's evidence against your religion.////That doesn't real
                |y make any sense. First of I agree that you will need evidence for making a claim like that the deity or deitie

                |http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism////Uh, yeah, Agnosticism is part of the modern set of philosophical du
                |lisms that most closely pertain to the western description of theological standpoints.////People that claim the
                |title of agnostic, rather than atheist are using the descriptors in a way that is literally incorrect. Moreover
                | it's usually just due to some perception of atheists being assholes, and "agnostics" not being dicks about it.
                |I think it's moreover about agnosticism and gnosticism, though. Generally speaking, the cultural problem with a
                |heists and theists alike, is where they stand on the gnostic spectrum. If they are pretty sure they KNOW, odds 
                |re, they are probably going to be an utter twat about it. If they aren't sure, they are significantly less like

            |I tend to "believe" there is "something" but logically cannot fathom  what that is.  Logically I get atheists but h

                |As someone who considers themselves intelligent and rational as well as a Christian, I'd just say make sure you
                |re separating the negative human behavior associated with that group from the idea of God himself. People are f
                |llible and make mistakes, and so can represent God poorly. If you genuinely seek him for yourself, don't be sur
                |rised if Jesus' words 'ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find' turn out to be true. If you hope the

            |It helped when I first became an atheist thinking I was better than the rest of the world.  Now that I have come to

                |I care only insomuch as they inflict it on other people and cause them harm.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of

                |I think this happens to a lot of people because of the self shame we feel that we were dooped for so long. We h

            |I consider myself lucky that hadn't heard of reddit years ago I was a rebellious teenager and decided that just not
            |believing in god wasn't good enough, no it was my duty to be an Atheist.  I went to a lot of metal shows, read Hitc

                |I think it is the opposite of a born again Christians. They found God, and they want everyone in the world to f

                |s some new found atheists find it crazy that people believe in a God, that is probably not there. So they go on
                |a "must prove every religion wrong" phase because they want to share their new found knowledge with the world.

                    |I know a lot of Born Again Christians that are just happy people and don't preach but live by example.  Tho

                    | will look for things that happy people have in their lives that make them happy.  Whether it a significant

                    |r just a significant other which is missing the point.////Christians and Atheists who preach are just a hug
                    | turnoff.  They're happy with their new found information but really don't get it.


                        |Anybody that preaches about anything that doesn't get brought up naturally will be a turnoff.////If me

                        |I think the enemy - that thing we all dislike so much - is fundamentalism. A Christian or atheist who w

                        |t" is always going to be more appealing. The fundamentalists, who believe that any view differing from 
                        |heir own is wrong by default and the consideration of them is akin to weakness and failure... those peo

                            |I don't know about that. As an atheist I've tried to read some books on the subject and people like

                        |I agree with /u/newvictim that you'll mostly just see aggression on the internet. However, I believe at
                        |eists have just as much of a right to be fundamentalist, so to speak, as a religious person. There is t

                        | that corrects others' BS anyway, so this aspect of my personality isn't particularly atheistic; howeve
                        |, these conversations generally promote more adrenaline than others, so points made are generally more 
                        |ontentious because, when you think about, it's a very serious and heavy topic.


                        |To be fair ive heard from a number of people that it was harder to come out as atheist then it was gay.
                        |People lack empathy when it comes to this because they only think about there situation regarding relig

                        |You have to also remember that the beliefs change, but the culture surrounding them hasn't. As many of

                        |vers. So, for many (not all) atheists, when they come to a new understanding of how the world works, th
                        |y eschew the teachings of modern Christianity, but not the attitudes of judgment, condescension, closed
                        |mindedness, etc. Why is this? Because, for many of us, we're taught life-long that this is the only way
                        |to share beliefs.////Don't be hard on them for that, though. Learning to throw off stuff you learn cult

                        |I have something against "god fearing", cause I fear no man or god, and if god really did exist, I stil
                        | would not fear him, cause that is slavery.


                        |Could very well be that when they hear a religious person talking about how something is wrong because 
                        |t is immoral they start to feel a little guilty so then they go on the offensive to make them selves fe
                        |l better about what they believe.

                        |I would disagree with the characterization of all religious people as non-threatening towards atheists.
                        |It's quite the opposite. Religious followers have throughout history made death threats against non-bel

                        |that certain religious people throw at atheists.


                        |That word "god fearing" always bothered me. Why should you be afraid of a benevolent god?


                        |I became an atheist as a teenager and by my college years, I was what one would consider pretty aggress

                        | the exact opposite.  INFURIATING.  And it just drove me crazy (CRAZY!) that no one else seemed to see 
                        |t.  I've mellowed a bit since then, mostly due to the fact that other people DO see it now and us athei
                        |ts actually have a voice.  Previously, though, I was aggressive even with fairly non-threatening religi

                    |Personally, I think it's the exact same process of conversion. But it is dependent on the person. If they f

            |I understand the impulse though. Atheists are in for a pretty serious uphill battle(at least in the US...) so being

            |It was very easy to turn into a cunt when I began thinking more for myself in my teenage years.  Well, I thought I

            |following the values my family had always instilled.  I suddenly became an angry cunt and was part of this new grou

            |But are you ex-/r/christianity?


                |No, I've never been to that sub.

                |I'm new to reddit so I don't really know the culture of each sub aside from most popular ones (and /r/atheism) 
                |ut no, nothing completely batshit insane like westboro. I was just one of those pushy obnoxious bible thumper j

        |So, just out of curiosity, I went to /r/atheism just to see what the top posts on there were.  Here are the top 5://///
        |1.  Atheist group's billboard on I-94 in Portage reads: 'Millions of Americans are living happily without religion'////
        |/2.  Pennsylvania Rep. Rick Saccone proposes legislation that would put the words “In God We Trust” in every public sch

        |and shelter. All scientific research has been halted, but the US House of Reps this morning is voting on an emergency s
        |op gap measure to restore funding to RELIGIOUS SERVICES AND MILITARY CHAPLAINS!//////4.  Supreme Court will rule on the
        |practice of opening town council meetings with a prayer, despite an appeals court ruling that found the invocations a v
        |olation of the First Amendment because they almost always were Christian prayers.//////5.  Last night, my friend was ki
        |led by a drunk driver. He was an atheist.//////////Maybe I'm just missing why I should absolutely despise that subreddi
        | like almost everyone else does... but I don't see anything blatantly self-righteous, overly smarmy, smug, or awful.


            |It stopped being a default. It shrank from what was essentially a bloated cesspool of anonymity to a community with
            |similar ideas. Atheism is simply not a good topic for a default subreddit.


                |Which kinda sucks - I lurked /r/atheism before it was default, then when it was default I kept seeing stupid "L
                | TROLL FACE COMICS" about "le dumb christiuns". I tried to ignore them, but there was very little of content ot
                |erwise.////Now it's scary to go there because of what it USED to be.


                    |I suspect a lot of them may have been Christian teenagers trying to be edgy and cool.////I have no basis fo
                    | this suspicion other than remembering my own teen years.////ohgodimgettingold


                |The mods also stopped letting them post memes recently, haven't they? That scared a lot of the kiddies off.


                    |It also took away the allure for trolls, r/cj'ers, and karmawhores.


                |There was also the mod coup that ended the one-click may-mays.  Today, it's a circlejerk again, not a cesspool.
                | What's more, there's hope that one day, it might even become a decent discussion sub.


                |Just like politics. Now I wonder what might be next on the list. Maybe worldnews.


                    |I'm subscribed to /r/politics and /r/circlejerk, and it is sometimes hard to tell the difference.


            |People who haven't been to /r/atheism since a year ago still use /r/atheism from a year ago to judge people who go 
            |here.


            |You're right.  It seems /r/atheism has changed a lot since it was on the front page.


            |Go to /r/atheismrebooted to see how bad /r/atheism used to be. 


            |No, it's gotten a lot better now. It used to be just a bunch of jerks posting on why religious people are stupid.


                |It was never 'just' shit posts.  The signal to noise ratio was just worse than it is now.  //Every subreddit ha
                | shit posts mixed in with the good ones, but I don't see people saying, "don't go to Reddit; it's shit."


                |Kind of like how /r/books used to be good and now is full of "OMG do you like Harry Potter and Game of Thrones 
                |oo?" *holds up spork*


                |That's simply not true. It was a default sub that questioned people's deeply held beliefs. Many viewed that as 
                |ersonal attacks. 


                |You mean it used to be a massive collaboration between reddit?


                |That sub is nothing like it was when I left. I did watch the Youth Pastor that was arrested for impersonating a
                |d officer video. The narrarator is annoying and loud, but the last part of the video with his interview right b
                |fore he got arrested is hilarious.


                |No they still do that


            |The sub has gone through some extensive moderation changes recently. A year ago /r/atheism was nothing but smug and
            |me messages deriding theists. 


            |It's funny, because every time I've seen someone say, "/r/atheism is smug and hateful and awful," I see a post like
            |yours saying, "Really? I don't see that. Please show me where..?"////The "smug and hateful" thing is an often repea
            |ed lie that has managed to take hold and perpetuate itself because it seems to jive with the popular (and equally w
            |ong) stereotype of atheists. ////It's kind of like people saying "/r/judaism" is all about how to screw people out 
            |f money or "/r/mexican" is all about trying to sneak over the border. Bad stereotypes are bad.


                |So I take it you have never read the comments over there, then.


                    |Sure I have. ////Have you not read the comments calling people out on being jerks? The comments that are vo
                    |ed to the top? ////Anyone can be a jerk. But the community, on the whole, doesn't seem to agree with that s

                        |Oh hey, you made a reference to a fedora! Per Reddit rules, that totally negates the shithole of a subr

            |There was a time where it was filled with anti-religious memes and posts calling out 'idiot' religious members of s
            |cieties. I initially joined it around the same time I joined /r/evolution ( a few years ago now) in the hopes of le
            |rning a bit more about the atheist 'subculture'. It was ok for a little while before turning in to what I described
            |above. I unsubbed from it and never returned, although I have heard many people say it has changed for the better. 
            | don't feel any need to subscribe again because I feel as though I am exposed more to religion while being subbed t
            |an when I am not subbed.


            |Since /r/Atheism was removed from the default subreddits and the circlejerk around it became worse than the actual 
            |ub, things started to get better. That's not saying much though, that's like saying that once you get a score of 0 
            |hings can only get better.


        |It's important to realize that many of the people on r/atheism are from very religiously oppressive places and are basi
        |ally just venting in a safe space.////I'm just as atheistic as they are, but coming from a liberal nordic country, I do
        |'t feel that need to vent nearly so often.////But I don't begrudge them their anger and release, most of them grow out 
        |f it, but as there are always new people being added to the mix, it seems like a constant level.


            |It's funny how that works.  I'm an atheist and pretty mellow about it too.  My parents believe in God, but we rarel
            | ever went to church.////My good friend however was militantly atheist for a long while.   His 5 year girlfriend dr
            |gged him to church every Sunday and he loathed the whole thing.  It feels like his hostiity towards religion was on
            | part genuine criticism towards it and another part resentment towards getting forced to go to church as a grown ma
            |.  ////It definitely seems like the more hostile atheists stem from the negative experiences those folks have with 
            |eligion.


                |I'd be willing to bet the entire /r/atheism-hate circlejerk consists of people who've never lived outside of a 
                |arge urban area where religion plays a minor role in day to day life.////These are the same idiots who berate t

        |There is a reason why talking about religion and politics is taboo, no one likes "I am right" people.


            |Religion is a bit different(though there is a time and place to discuss it) but I cannot stand it when people think
            |talking about politics is a bad thing.  There are times when it isn't appropriate, but generally refusing to discus
            | how the world is and should be run is just ignorant.


                |Exactly. If you can't talk politics, it's because you're political 'beliefs' have gone unchallenged for too lon

                |Politics goes WAY deeper than most people realize. I don't talk politics with people that I don't care about du

                    |Uh it's definitely taboo to talk about politics among the wealthy. Easy way to get yourself labeled a boor.

                |It was a very TL;DR version.  The first one I met at the church on campus.  The 2nd I met at work.  For the rec

            |Were you actually an atheist? You believed that religion was man-made and a product of our superstitious tendencies
            | You didn't think Jesus was the son of god, and possibly not even a real person? You believed that the Koran and th
            | Bible are both not true, and that "sin" is an imaginary concept. Now you believe that Jesus provides atonement for
            |these sins that are now important? You now believe that the god of Abraham inspired many authors to write the books
            |of the Bible, but that it stopped there and didn't continue on to the Koran? Is this all correct, or are you just a
            |Christian culturally?

        |n away from them, and after a few years apart from the church I one day realized that I simply didn't believe in God an
        |more.////I did a stint in /r/atheism as well, although mostly under a different username so checking my history won't s

    |Honestly, and straight to the point- I saw a ghost. No joking. If there are ghosts out there, then our souls in fact must b
    | real, so it therefore led me to believe about three years ago that if ghosts can exist God must too. Who else would play s
    |ch a cruel, terrifying joke on us? How can energy take the form of a human with a memory of a demise? It confused me for qu
    |te a long time, until I finally gave up while talking to a rabbi and admitted he may be right.////Edit: I was raised with a
    | Italian Roman Catholic mother and Jewish father. I was nothing for quite some time because I was constantly harassed by gr
    |ndparents, aunts uncles, and parents to choose a religion. 


        |I am Catholic myself, my friend, but I don't really follow your logic here. Even ruling out the notion that it was all 
        |n your head (which would be my first personal assumption if I saw a ghost, after ruling out all other logical explanati
        |ns) then how is the next logical step to believe in religion, or a God? If ghosts can exist, God must too? Howso? Ghost
        | could simply be an explainable scientific phenomena that we do not currently have an understanding of. Or ghosts could
        |equally prove any other number of religions outside of the Abrahamic ones, if you want to say that they are simply a re
        |igious matter. What, exactly, is the tie in logic between ghosts existing and Judeo-Christianity?


        |Interesting. Would you be willing to explain the situation of your ghost sighting?


        |I forget who said this when talking about miracles but the same can apply to ghosts or anything "supernatural. "Which i
        | more likely? That the laws of nature were suspended in your favor or that you are under a misapprehension." //


        |I'm being serious, anyone else see the ghost?


        |Isn't it a coincidence that one of the two (related) religions that you were given as options turned out to be one that
        |you ended up believing in? Why didn't you choose Hinduism? I worry that you have abandoned or have not learned critical
        |thinking. What is more likely, that your eyes or mind was playing tricks on you (this can happen with or without drugs)
        | or that ghosts exist -&gt; therefore souls exist -&gt; therefore the god of Abraham exists. Are you not observing thes
        | internal leaps you are making? How do you know the "ghost" wasn't a Japanese Yurei? Why be so credulous and unskeptica
        |?

    |I'm kind of wandering the line. I was raised openly. "You may believe what you want, we have no say on the matter." - and l
    |oking back I truly appreciate that sort of freedom which so many other people lack. When the idea of kids came up with an e
    | of mine she practically went apoplectic in her screaming over suggesting we could do the same. NO THEY'RE CATHOLIC I WAS C
    |THOLIC AND I TURNED OUT FINE uhuh sure looks like it sweetie.////I decided, upon careful consideration and many many david 
    |ttenborough nature documentaries (I was watching them before I was watching cartoons) that I am an atheist. Nature is just 
    |oo profoundly awesome to begin attributing it to some higher power; it's blatantly absurd. From the seas to the sky to the 
    |tars, it is beyond any religious purview by far. ////Then I met my wife. Now this is going to sound odd, because she too is
    |atheistic- but she's had a radically spiritual effect on my life. There can not be chance involved in her, we're too perfec
    | for one another and it really doesn't compute. Neither of us are praying to any deity, there is no silliness of such a sor
    |, but I've become willing to accept the idea that life may be a little bit more than sheer chance. When I pass I will make 
    |ne prayer, possibly the only one I'll make, just asking that if there is some sort of life after death, that it would be wi
    |h her.  ////*"Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light; I have loved the stars too fondly to be fe
    |rful of the night."*//


    |Posted this a while back in r/Islam. ////I was raised Methodist until about 12 and then my father and mother had what I cal
    | a spiritual divorce as my mother wanted to go back to her roots as a southern Baptist. They were still married mind you, b
    |t us kids had to chose who we'd go to church with. I was closer to my mother at the time so I then went to a southern bapti
    |t church until I went to college.////Like many who are raised in a faith I just went through the motions. I "believed" or a
    | least thought I did. It was certainly my worldview that there was a trinity and that accepting Jesus meant your sins were 
    |orgiven and you go to heaven. But I just accepted all that without much thinking. It wasn't until college that I started re
    |ding more about Christianity and revealed religions in general.////The thing that really got to me was late one night on th
    | internet I read The Age of Reason by Thomas Paine. He brought a critical eye to the scriptures that I had never really con
    |idered before. And for the first time I really questioned why I believe in the authenticity of such works. I knew I could n
    |t remain a Christian and be honest with myself. I abandoned the faith instantly.////I then transitioned to Deism, as I stil
    | felt the need for existence to have a creator. But that lasted only about a year. I transitioned from Deism to Atheism as 
    | thought about the nature of the universe and the idea that matter or energy is never created or destroyed. It simply chang
    |d forms. This makes the universe eternal. I conceived of the universe as a cycle of big bangs, never ending. With existence
    |now being self sustaining the addition of an outside "creator" simply added unneeded complexity to the system and didn't pr
    |vide any additional insight or answers. I continued as an Atheist for about a decade. The first five years being quite bitt
    |r toward religion but mellowing more and more as I aged.////As time went on I began to see a lot of good in religion. At th
    | very least, I thought, it served a particular human need of spiritual elevation and communal organization. Something Athei
    |m was sorely lacking.////Then I met a girl.////She was Muslim. Uh oh, I thought.////She was relatively moderate in her view
    |, and was fine with me holding my atheistic views as she felt I was a good man underneath. I have always been fascinated wi
    |h religion ever since I rejected it and had been meaning to read the Quran ever since Islam really entered into mainstream 
    |merican thoughts on 9/11. Plus I wanted to learn more about her religion and her culture, so I read the Quran. I started re
    |earching things online, lurking in Islamic forums etc.////There was a lot that I liked. For one thing Islam clearly pointed
    |out the troublesome aspects of Christianity. It also appealed to me in its very focused idea of the Oneness of God. It got 
    |e thinking again about the universe, existence, our place in it and as a part of it. I started to see how the concept of Go
    | doesn't have to be some anthropomorphized other out there. I started to see how one could see the beauty and the wonder of
    |the timeless, eternal, interconnectedness of all that is and all that will be as God. God isn't a dude in a robe and long b
    |ard. God is indescribable. God is unfathomable. All we can do is try to catch glimpses of God in the wonder around us. I sw
    |ar I'm not as big a blow hard as this is making me sound like.////There's plenty of things in Islam I have trouble with. Mo
    |t of which comes from the Hadith literature. But the core of Islam made sense to my very rational and science-based way of 
    |hinking. Granted I certainly take much of the Quran and teachings in a more figurative way than many traditional Muslims pr
    |bably do. But I saw at its core much truth. And even the rituals which at times seem somewhat arbitrary and silly, I came t
    | appreciate as methods of bringing your soul closer to the infinite.////It took me a while to realize those rituals aren't 
    |eally for God's sake. God doesn't need my prayers or worship. But we do. Each time we pray it's like exercising a muscle, g
    |tting stronger in our spirituality and closer to the divine. The same is true with sin. When we sin we do not harm God. We 
    |arm our selves. Our souls are weakened and scarred. And by doing good we heal our souls a little bit. We're in a constant b
    |ck and forth battle between the harming of our souls and the healing and strengthening. Ideally as we grow we become more a
    |d more strong and less and less weak and scarred on the balance.////I've yet to take Shahada, but I feel it is only a matte
    | of time, God willing as right now I continue to study, read and practice.//


        |May Allah make it easy on you. 


    |I'm a recovering alcoholic.  None of us know what is going on here.  I believe in god for that reason alone.  I used to be 
    | militant atheist.


        |&gt; None of us know what is going on here.//////Then why assume a god had anything to do with it?


        |Forgive me for taking you literally; I'm sure this is not what you meant, but ... "militant atheist"? You ... blew up b
        |ildings and yelled "fire" in a crowded theater because there is no god?////Sorry, but that term really needs to die. Th
        |re are no militant atheists. Asshole atheists, intolerant atheists, maybe, but none of us are organizing militias and p
        |eparing to sacrifice our lives for the lack of deity.


            |I'll go with "asshole atheist".


    |I was raised Christian and denounced my faith when I was a senior in high school. I studied philosophy in college and it hi
    | me that throughout history humans of basically every culture have believed in some sort of higher power. There has always 
    |een a metaphysical part of life that is not explainable with science. Regardless of time, sophistication or location, cultu
    |es have always come up with a religious explanation for what they can't explain otherwise. The only conclusion that I could
    |draw is that there is some sort of higher power and nobody can fully explain/understand it. Thus, I firmly believe in a hig
    |er power, but I do not associate with any one religion in particular. 


    |Started out as a Christian here. Grew up with lax parents though so we only went to Church once or twice a month. Wasn't ab
    |e to ask questions about religion and just had to accept everything as it was. Years later I found out the reason we didnt 
    |o to church often was the preacher dude was a huge tool and said things like "Dinosaurs never existed." and my parents didn
    |t like some of the things he taught. //////Anywho, as I got older I prayed a lot and tried to be a "good Christian" and at 
    |ome point I would pray for simple things. Let my dog get better. Let my sister be okay. Let my dad find help. Help my mom w
    |th her addiction. Give me a sign. Something. ANYTHING!!////And it never came. My dog died, my sister was not okay, my dad n
    |ver got the help he needed, and neither did my mom. I never got any help, any signs, or anything I prayed for. I wasn't sel
    |ish and asking for toys or a new bike. I just wanted my family to be okay. And finally after my sister burned her hand real
    |y bad while cooking that was the last straw. My sister had been through so much shit and bad luck for months now and all I 
    |rayed for was for her to catch a break. So I figured any all powerful and all knowing god wouldn't let his children suffer 
    |ike this and so I stopped praying. I stopped believing. I stopped going to church and I stopped caring. //////This was oppo
    |ite of what you asked. But it's relevant. So for the next half of my life I was hardcore atheist. I renounced god every cha
    |ge I got. Belittled people who believed in him. Argued how stupid they were and more or less touted that humans are just hi
    |hly intelligent animals that evolved. And I met a girl. Had a baby. And...I dunno. She was religious and spiritual and I to
    |d her how I felt and she said that was okay. But in respect for her I kept my opinions on religion to myself. We had talks 
    |bout what we would tell our daughter and we agreed to raise her with beliefs in God and all the good stuff. Eventually bad 
    |hings happened and I didn't pray for an almighty fix and it was really hard at first but my prayers sounded mostly like.../
    |//"Hey God. It's me. Long time no talky huh? Yeah my bad. So hey I was wondering if you could help me with something. I kno
    | I've been kind of a jerk but I was hoping you could give me a little help with my anger issues. Give me the strength to ov
    |rcome that crippling weakness of mine. Thanks God. Amen."//////And it's just more or less stuck. Am I 100% sure what waits 
    |or me when I die? No. But I believe in hope and light and I believe that something is pushing me in the right direction, be
    |it an omnipotent God or just my faith in said God that helps me push on. 


    |I'm a straight male Christain and I don't care if you're gay, straight or athiest. I believe that everyone's opinions matte

            |http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net


        |Care to elaborate?//


        |So glad I found this. Experiencing something like that changes you, for better or worse.


        |When people say "psychedelics showed me how we're all connected and part of the same thing, and that's God!" I'm like..
        |no that's called the Universe. It shares all characteristics with what we call the Universe. People who've lost their f
        |ith but still "believe in something...energy" or whatever want to call it God but I don't see any good reason for that.


        |psychedelics tend to have that effect :)


        |Pray tell what exactly in modern physics led you to believe in a god? If anything studying modern physics led me in the
        |exact opposite direction.


        |Me too. DMT especially. And yeah, quantum physics....


            |Could you guys elaborate on why physics changed your beliefs? I've always felt that physics (and psilocybin) pushed
            |me more towards non-belief than the other way.


    |I hope it's not too late, but I want to tell my story somewhere for the first time.  It's nothing spectacular, but it make 
    |e rethink everything.////December 2012, I was driving to a meeting through some country backroads.  On a left curve, my rig
    |t tires went off the shoulder, kicked up gravel, lost traction, etc.  I was going 80mph (~129kph) on a 40mph turn.  Last th
    |ng I remember before blacking out was being turned 180 degrees on the road and the passenger side of my car lifting up to f
    |ip.  [This is how the car ended up.](http://i.imgur.com/CuR6Zhj.png)////I had been buckled firming into the driver's seat. 
    |I woke up sitting on the front passenger side with my back resting against the door window and my legs laying straight out 
    |ver the roof of the car.  The seatbelt was unbuckled.  My phone, which was sitting on the passenger seat and should have be
    |n flung around and smashed, was sitting neatly on my lap untouched.  On my dashboard there were pokemon cards.  Those cards
    |were inside a tin container, inside a cardboard box, inside a bigger cardboard box, inside the trunk, and still made it to 
    |y dashboard.  How the fuck didn't my phone get annihilated?////You see on that picture, my hood is bent up and back.  That'
    | the only thing that stopped the passenger seat (where I ended up) from being crushed in the ground.  It is also the ONLY s
    |ot in the car where I would have survived; everything else was in the ground or had the roof crushed down into the space.  
    |nywhere else, I would've been crushed or impaled.  But how the hell did I get there from being buckled in the passenger sea
    |?////The icing on the cake, is I had absolutely no injuries.  Both airbags deployed, but neither of them had touched me.  M
    | glasses were sitting on my face completely untouched, wouldn't an airbag usually smash those if they had hit?  Not even a 
    |ed mark on my chest from where the seatbelt was.  Not a scratch.  Nothing.  It's as if I were taken out of my car when I bl
    |cked out, and was placed safely back inside on the only spot I could have safely been, and was given my phone so I could ca
    |l for help.  Someone was looking out for me.////**Last minute thought:**  My friend Amanda was supposed to carpool with me 
    |o this meeting, but she cancelled because something extremely unexpected came up when she was only 5 minutes away from my h
    |use.  She would've been killed if she had come with, no doubt in my mind.////[Here are some more pictures of aftermath](htt
    |://imgur.com/a/UEQsk)


        |Consider all the people horribly mangled in car crashes.  Can we deduce from this that "someone is NOT looking out" for
        |them?////How are unlikely events any indication of a deity?////


    |I quit drinking over a year ago with the help of AA, and for me it really did help me see that there is a higher power that
    |is in control, not me.  In the first week of sobriety a flower bloomed on a pear tree in my backyard, when no blooms should
    |have been blooming, because it was the end of september and the leaves would soon start falling.  That was a spiritual expe
    |ience for me.  To me, it felt like God (or a higher power, let's just call him God) was letting me know that there is beaut
    | in the world outside of my own selfishness and that everything was going to be alright with me.  


    |Honestly, it's because it is reassuring to think someone may be watching over me, and that my life isn't just all up to cha
    |ce, dumb luck and fate.


        |Aren't chance/luck and fate opposites?


        |Something being nice to believe isn't reason enough for me to believe it.  Realizing that my whole belief system was bu
        |lt to coddle my fragile psyche would be pretty horrible.


            |That is you and it is good you know that about you. Not everyone feels that way, though.


                |I didn't say everyone does or should, just that it wouldn't be my cup of tea.


        |I find it infinitely scarier to think the Christian god is watching over me.. that guy likes genocides a little bit too
        |much. 


            |Atheist or not, I don't think there's much of a case for the God of the Old Testament being an accurate figure.


                |And the god of the New Testament is?  Why? Because he's a lot softer and kinder? 


                    |Under that circumstance I just don't see too much of an argument for his existence. 


        |I'd like to say that (at least in my opinion) God doesn't control all the events of the world. Please note I am not a d
        |ist, but I do believe there are many a fault in our stars that God does nessasarily cause.


        |You don't get creeped out that someone's watching you all the time?


        |This is so strange to me.////It's like, idunno, it's like you imagine that this Guy has placed you down into a dangerou
        | cage with traps and predators and parasites and radiation, and He did this *in order* to steer you through it. Literal
        |y until you can't take it anymore.////I cannot fathom how that feels "reassuring". I would be terrified if i believed t


        |While it is reassuring, how would you know if you chose the right religion? Every religion damns the other. ////I can u
        |derstand that it is reassuring, but I'd rather not live with blinders on.


            |You don't have to convert to a religion to believe in a higher power.


    |I've not converted to any religion but I was a staunch atheist for a very long time. I recently have started calling myself
    |agnostic with the idea that I like to think that reincarnation is real. It makes me happy to think that so I just stick wit
    | it.


    |I was raised Catholic, but turned atheist when I started learning more about the Catholic religion and its past. It was rea
    |ly horrifying to read about all of the religious conflicts and religious wars that have happened. Also, the Catholic church
    |turns its back on gays while it seems to be OK with child molestation. ////But for me, it has truly come to the point of di
    |ferentiating between religion and the institution of a religion. Being Catholic, in essence, means being a good neighbor, h
    |lping others, and come together as a community. Regardless of what the church has done in the past, I think it's important 
    |o recognize the values that are being taught by the Bible. ////I think believing God gives meaning to your life aside from 
    |his money-driven world. In a way, it motivates you to help others in your community, and not be so self-involved. And now t
    |at I am a believer again, praying really helps me to calm my nerves and makes me feel less anxious in certain situations. I
    |'s almost as if believing allows me to feel as if there is someone who is rooting for me to do my best.


    |Alright, so I was born and raised Catholic.////In 3rd grade my oldest sister tried to kill herself and was sent to the ment
    |l hospital for a short while. This made me begin to question the idea that there is a God.  What benevolent God would allow
    |so much suffering? Then, in 4th grade, I began to realize that the romantic "crushes" I felt on guys I also felt on girls. 
    |I went through a lot of self-hatred then because homosexuality was wrong according to the church.////In 6th grade when I re
    |lized it was okay for me to like both guys and girls was the same time I realized I no longer had faith in God.  I was a pr
    |ud and loud atheist all through middle school.  Of course, I was still being dragged to church by my parents because that i
    | how the Catholic faith works.  My soul was on them until Confirmation when I could make that decision for myself.  I respe
    |t my parents, so I respected that and their beliefs even if I didn't want to.////Late in my freshman year, one of my closes
    | friends told me he was going to kill himself.  He had said this before, but this time I felt like he meant it.  And I didn
    |t have the strength on my own to deal with this.  I remember going outside to the creek behind my house, my thinking spot, 
    |nd just falling to my knees.  I was powerless, I was weak, what was I supposed to do to help him?////I firmly believe I was
    |touched by an angel that day.  Yeah, I realize on a logic level it sounds ridiculous.  But it was through the grace of God 
    |hat day that I was able to tell my mom what was happening and getting my friend help.////I was still a bit uneasy about the
    |entire religion thing.  Yes, I believed in God, but religion?  Religion was messy.  Religion provided no additional benefit
    |////Then, in CCD (Catholic sunday school) my sophomore year, I had to go on this retreat called Destination Jesus.  (I stil
    | cannot say that name seriously.)  This was my last Catholic requirement before my parents would let me make my decision.  
    | just had to get through this three day retreat and I would be done.////The theme of the retreat was "Mighty To Save", and 
    |t was all about how God uses us and our weaknesses to shine his light to others.  To me, this reaffirmed what I had felt th
    | prior year when I needed help getting my friend help.  God used me, in my weakness, to reach out to someone else.////Howev
    |r, this weekend was also a lot of learning about Catholicism.  And the thing is, while I don't agree with a lot of the doct
    |ine that (in my opinion) has nothing to do with the bible (such as homosexuality, divorce, abortion, birth control, etc. [Y
    |s, I realize, select passages deal with this. But I don't agree with how people pick and choose what to listen to in the bi
    |le, so I'd rather use it as a reference than as a law book.]), I love the ritualistic nature of Catholicism.  I find comfor
    | in the church and in the Eucharistic.  A lot of healing from my own depression and self-hatred happens in the church.////T
    |e last day of DJ we did this thing called Eucharistic Adoration.  Pretty much, the Eucharist (communion wafer) is blessed, 
    |nd in Catholic belief we truly believe that this is the body of Christ.  It is then put in a holder like [this](http://livi
    |gmonstrance.stblogs.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1324/files//2008/05/monstrance2.gif), and, in this situation, the priest walke
    | around holding it up.  We were each given an opportunity to touch the cloth that he was using to hold the Eucharist.////I 
    |ave never felt God so strongly in my life as I did in that moment.  I have never felt so loved, forgiven, accepted... 4 yea
    |s later and I still tear up thinking about it.  And if it was the Catholic faith that had this ritual that I needed, then I
    |was going to stay in the Catholic faith.////And that is the very long story of how I went full circle from being Catholic, 
    |o being an atheist, back to being Catholic.


    |DMT. I don't really care how anyone tries to explain it, I know what I experienced. Simply put, I saw the other side, came 
    |ack, and I know there is *something* on the other side of death. I wouldn't call it heaven, I wouldn't call it hell, I woul
    |n't call it purgatory, I don't know what to call it, but I do know one thing,  *this* isn't all there is, not by a long sho
    |. That thing that you and I beyond our personality, what is is that is looking through your eyes, my eyes,  experiencing be
    |ng in a body as a human, the awareness itself is not restricted to the body, but during the physical life experience it is 
    |ocked into the flesh. You forget this when you come in, and that's what allows for you to have a completely raw experience 
    |f life.  Without forgetting, there is no wonder, no rediscovery, you can't fully have the experience we are having. ////As 
    |uch as I don't want to die, I am no longer afraid of it since I know it's not lights out on my awareness, it's simply the e
    |d of my awareness as this current person. I often lose sight of all of this and get caught up in silly bullshit, but it's i
    |credibly helpful when it gets overwhelming to remember that it's all essentially just a game in mind, and every little ting
    |gon' be alright.////On a second note, it also made me laugh about our idea or labels of 'god'. What I experienced showed me
    |that what is 'god' is so much bigger than any kind of belief or idea our little human brains can even imagine. Referring to
    |it as anything other than everything is not describing it, and any words you can make up or use to describe it doesn't even
    |scratch the surface. It is indescribable, omnipotent, all pervasive, and definitely NOT what pretty much any religion attem
    |ts to explain it as, and yet it is at the same time. It's a paradox in its truest nature, and any attempt to use logic or r
    |ason to explain or attempt to understand it is futile, which makes it hilarious. 


    |I tot start the story of my conversion you need to understand I suffered from suicidal thoughts and depression, for at leas
    | six or seven years, and never knew about miricales.  At the seventh year of this pain I one day was invited to a youth gro
    |p went every so often and enjoyed it. Towards the point where I was going to kill myself and really desperate I went to thi
    | youth group one last time before I'd kill myself. Randomly the guy came over and asked if he could pray for me said sure w
    |at the heck. He recited a bible verse over me "you can do all things through christ who strengthens you" and all of a sudde
    | I felt a rush of warm energy and I felt happiness for the first time in seven years. I believe I was healed by God. And ha
    |e never been the same sense thanks for reading this and bless you ////Colin

        |It worked for YOU. That is good. But you said you were mentally ill. You still are but you have a new imaginary friend

    |[Pascal's Wager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager) Seriously. 


        |But incase you win the wager,will not Deity/God know that you only half believed? 


        |I first learned about Pascal's wager from the mouse-over text in [this](http://xkcd.com/525/) XKCD comic.  It's a prett
        | compelling argument against atheism.


    |Short answer: we need to believe there is something, or someone, superior to us that can give us hope.////Long answer: most
    |people argue with religion because of science. They see a religious person and mock them, because they believe that science
    |has the answers to everything (because it makes sense and gives actual explanations, while religion is based on faith). Man
    | philosophers have discussed that we need to believe in a god, we need to have a superior being in our lives because someti
    |es we are not strong enough to deal with certain problems (like losing a son). ////For example, my little brother was diagn
    |sed with leukemia last year. I got depressed and, obviously, angry. So the first few weeks I said to myself that doctors we
    |e going to help him and just left when my family prayed. But then, relying on medicine wasnt enough. Even if god did not ex
    |st, I needed to feel better someway. Even if the doctors were doing their best, I felt useless. So I prayed. After a while 
    |y brother's cancer went in remission. Was it god? Probably not, it was most likely science. But it didn't really matter if 
    |t was god or not, what mattered was that clinging to a superior being helped me out of my depression and made me feel like 
    | did something important. I went to a church group and asked the logical thing, why would a five year old, who has done not
    |ing to anyone, have a terrible thing like cancer? And they gave me the best possible answer: "we don't know". ////And there
    |s the answer. There are some things we don't understand, we don't control and we can't change. We need a superior being, go
    |, to get through tough moments because relying 100% on science or other beliefs is not enough.//


        |Humans are weak and ignorance makes us feel better.


    |I decided I wanted to recover from alcoholism.//


    |I know I'm late to this party, but my tidbit:////I was raised in a non-theist house; not 'atheist' per se, but just never b
    |thered with any of that. From when I was about 15, that just didn't sit well/feel right to me. The tension (real or imagine
    |) between science and religion is hilarious as far as I'm concerned- the more I learn about science (I'm a grad student in 
    |icrobiology at Johns Hopkins now) the stronger I believe. I honestly don't care what other people believe if it brings them
    |peace, but I personally can't look at the biochemistry of the blood coagulation cascade or the intricacies of immune system
    |cell signaling and say that there's no God. I get evolution, you can feel free to write a long and confident reply about ho
    | these are quite possible without evoking God and I just don't understand them enough, but to me that just doesn't cut it a
    |d for that I'm really grateful. ////I don't really pick fights on the internet, nor have I conducted a deep study of variou
    | faiths- maybe some day I will- and I'm well aware of the arguments "against" the existence of God. Interestingly r/atheism
    |has kinda helped in that regard; I read the arguments, consider them carefully and whether I feel like they are valid, and 
    |sually feel that there is a great counter-argument and so I disregard them. Similarly r/catholicism has helped me believe m
    |re firmly that unions between two people of any gender are beautiful and as God intended- because I see what are probably t
    |e best arguments out there, probe them and really truly give them a lot of thought, and in the end decide that they are not
    |right and I can sleep soundly.////I've explored a number of denominations that didn't feel right, and have for the past few
    |years been attending Catholic Mass. It is beautiful and peaceful and I feel that doing so has helped my come a long way in 
    |y faith. There are some things I don't agree with, and those might prevent me from becoming Catholic in the end, but deep d
    |wn it feels like home.


    |[This was a big part] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTgSSuuR1Jw)//[I also watched the screwtape letters] (http://www.yout
    |be.com/watch?v=unm57eAspy4). This one gave me goosebumps a few times, I was raised Christian and converted back to "I don't
    |give a fuck" for a long time, following the life clears your conscious, and relying on god frees the soul. The family pract
    |ce leads to a better society but spirituality is a life long religion. Also please don't mistake the catholic religion with
    |the catholic church, the church is made up of humans who operate on free will and are by no means perfect so mistakes will 
    |appen.


    |I've been doing a lot of meditation and when I get to a really deep meditative trance I feel a presence around me. The way 
    |t feels is sort of undescribable- like it's observing us in a kind of a bemused way, just floating, and it's everything and
    |nothing all at once.////Obviously this could just be some trick of meditation, but I definitely wouldn't describe myself as
    |atheist anymore, maybe some kind of agnostic. 


    |I got in a relationship with a very religious boy, who threatened to break up with me unless I converted to Christianity.
